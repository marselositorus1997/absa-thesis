Quite by coincidence those same customers seem to have handbags big enough to use on a serious weeks hiking, bless them.",0,4

This didn't happen so I contacted them. The refund had been missed on their system and will now take up to another 14 days to process.

Aldi UK,Missing Shed,"Ordered a Keter Garden Shed from Aldi on the 13th April. Initially the communications from Aldi was great. There was a delay processing the order which is fine and that was communicated. However, once it reached the courier, that is when everything went wrong. I waited a week and the order just stayed at ""Create"". I contacted Aldi who said there is a delay with the couriers and wait another week, I waited another week and the order was still at ""Create"". I called Aldi again who then said they would contact the courier. I waited another 3 days and the order was still at ""Create"", called customer services who said the item it ""Lost"". Aldi were quick to refund at this point but this was a 33KG shed. How can a courier lose this. And reading some reviews here, this looks like a common occurance.Also if you go onto the courier's website, there is no way to contact them directly.Aldi, generally you are great but for online orders, please use a different delivery company. XDP do not seem up to the job.",0,1

On inspection at home she discovered a missing item and a substandard item. She has tried, with no success, to obtain a refund. Aldi just don't care. She has been advised that she must return to the store, at her own expense (both fuel and time) for Aldi to rectify THEIR mistake. We're talking less than £4, but they insist they cannot issue a refund for the items via the original payment method. Rather, they'd prefer a pensioner to make an entirely unnecessary journey during a pandemic. Abysmally low standard of customer service.",0,1

Aldi UK,Never buy from Aldi online,"I ordered a bed from Aldi six weeks ago. After numerous calls to the “helpline” I eventually received half the bed. Amongst the ridiculous information I was given I was told I had only ordered half a bed! Eventually I went to a local store and the manager arranged to have the bed section collected. Once the package had been collected I was told I would receive a refund from the warehouse within two weeks - but - if I did not receive the refund to get in touch and they would refund me directly. When I contacted them after two weeks I was once again told that the helpline could not process my refund as the bed was so expensive. The request had to be sent to somebody with more authority.I am still waiting. In the meantime, at almost 70, I am having to sleep on a mattress on the floor. Aldi could not send me the missing part as they do not split beds. I find that difficult to understand as they already had with my delivery. They would not send out a replacement bed because the item was so expensive. By the time the bed was collected the bed had sold out.Aldi recognise that they have taken “a lot of money” from me yet they are happy to leave me out of pocket. It is not surprising that to reach the helpline you have to hang on for over an hour. I suspect everyone who buys anything must be trying to either get their money back or find out where the goods are.",0,1

After Yodel miss delivered the order 3 times it was returned to Aldi. After nearly 2 ½ hours on hold to the customer services line and being cut off 3 times I resorted to e mail. After several e mails not replied to within their 5 working day time limit I finally lost patience. I e mailed to say that my next communication would be to Trading Standards. Low and behold my missing order was despatched. It duly arrived and was dumped on my drive in full view.This process has taken a month. My order was abandoned outside my house on April 21st. At no point has there been a hint of an apology or any form of compensation. Aldi’s claim of Every Day Excellence is plainly not true. Not impressed.

Aldi UK,Just another level.,"A few months ago we had a click and collect order from Asda that was missing an item. Without leaving the collection point we went back and asked for the item (a 20L bag of cat litter.) The chap who packed our items proceeded to fetch a torch and search our car for the litter (the massive, heavy 20L bag we couldn't possibly have hidden) and made us feel like thieves.You can imagine our anxiety when, upon returning home from an Aldi click and collect today, we found most of our order was missing (including lots of beer and wine) and we were left with a lot of items we didn't order. We returned to the collection point, now in the pouring rain, and were quickly greeted by the woman who had packed our shopping earlier.The difference was night and day. First of all she apologised for the mix up, then she carefully took note of our missing items, then promptly returned and packed our car with them. No searching, no questions, just a quick acknowledgment of a mistake anyone could've made and a cheeky sweet treat as compensation.In general we've had a great experience with Aldi's click and collect service - they use compostable bags, their staff are always attentive and polite, we couldn't recommend them more.",0,5
Aldi UK,Aldi London Road Brighton not very planet friendly,"Whilst queing at the till I noticed the delivery team packing with nice paper bags with handles. They were the same size has Morrisons ones. I thought Aldi had started to change however I was soon Told ""Brown paper bags for Delivery Only & not for In store shopping""This is Not Very Planet Friendly BTW Aldi London Road Brighton. So I decided to let the world know that Aldi isn't very kind to us or the planet has they are maybe delivery bags only when really Customers Should have a choice to purchase brown paper bags with handles instead of Toxic plastic bags that actually touch the pavement and rip with myself has I'm short.

Aldi UK,Stear clear of Aldi online worst customer experience I have ever had …,Ordered a Kamado bbq like many many others it arrived 3 weeks late and broken by the cowboy delivery company Aldi choose to use XDP. Have tried to call Aldi customer service on 3 occasions and gave up on 3 occasions after almost an hour in a queue . Aldi do not respond to emails.

Aldi UK,Regulate under Gambling Commission,"Right this Review is 2 stars on the basis their stores are brilliant. However, shopping online with Aldi should be regulated under the gambling commission. I can't tell you not to use Aldi online. They have some great products and some unbelievable prices. HOWEVER, if you do order from them, go in eyes wide open to the fact there's a 25% chance you will receive your goods, and a 75% chance you'll have to wait 6 weeks for your money back. Actually that's unfair. Those 6 weeks aren't just waiting. Those 6 weeks are endless phone calls to Aldi, their delivery company of choice XDP (I'll come on to those crooks), 6 weeks of confusion, disappointment, and anger. Once you finally resign yourself to the fact that you're not getting what you ordered they kick you swiftly between the legs in the groin region by stating they are keeping YOUR MONEY for a further 10-14 working days because ""that's our policy"". Honestly, at this point I'm amazed that they deliver on any orders with the level of incompetence shown by both Aldi and XDP. Oh yes, XDP, I've done a separate review for them, but assuming the D in XDP stands for Delivery I can only deduce that their application of irony far outweighs their ability to actually deliver anything. In summary - If you're prepared to hand over your cash understanding there's a 25% chance you'll receive your goods, and a 75% chance you'll have to chase for 6 weeks to get your cash back then go ahead. The bargains are tempting. If you think ""life's too short"" then give them a wide birth. **25% based on 4 people I know, including me, ordering Kamado Egg BBQs and 3 going missing, and 1 being delivered.",0,2

Aldi UK,NEVER AGAIN!,"On 26th March I ordered an egg BBQ at a cost of £350 and paid £10 delivery. The estimated arrival was between 2 and 7 working days.I received pre alert on 3rd April but it took until 12th April for the item to be showing at the XDP delivery warehouse. No contact had been made by XDP to arrange delivery. I tried to contact them by phone at 7p per minute. The queueing system said I was second in the queue however after over an hour and a £5 I had no response. I tried sending an email to the customer service address given but he message quickly bounced back as the address was incorrect. I could not access online chat.On 13th April the XDP delivery message was updated to say that the consignment was damaged.I tried to contact Aldi customer services and was on hold for over one and a half hours. Eventually 'Jared' answered but informed me that the goods were not showing as damaged on his tracking system. He promised to investigate and call the following day.There was no phone call.On 15th I rang again and spoke to Zed He confirmed that the goods were damaged and that I would not receive them however I could not have a refund until XDP returned the damaged goods to Aldi. I pointed out that I did not have any contract with XDP and my contract for the purchase was with Aldi and as such I expected a refund to be processed with immediate effect. Zed allegedly spoke to a supervisor who agreed to process the refund immediately and send email confirmation.This was not done.On 16th I spoke with my credit card company who confirmed that no refund had been processed.I rang Aldi again and was told that it may take up to 14 working days to process a refund. Three whole weeks REALLY? The operator put me on hold to speak to a supervisor but after 16 minutes I was cut off.I tried contacting Aldi via their Face book messenger page, it took them 12 days to reply. I also emailed but received no response what so ever.I contacted Aldi customer services again on 25th April as I was still waiting for a refund. I was told it was in the pipeline. I asked the operator 'Amy' to clarify exactly what the meaning of that was and was again told refund request had been made but it may take 14 working days.I politely told her that if the refund was not in my credit card account by Monday 3rd May at the latest then I would be taking steps to recover the £360 they owed me by legal means.I then received a reply to my Facebook message saying the goods were now officially missing. Is that XDP speak for STOLEN and on EBAY?On the 27th a refund was processed which hit my account yesterday.I have several issues with this debacle:Why are Aldi using a courier with a reputation such as XDP. If the 'damaged' goods are not being returned by the courier then have they been stolen?Why is it impossible to speak to anyone at XDP and why are they getting away with charging 7p per minute to keep customers on hold for lengthy periods. Clearly this is a money making scam.Why is it so damn difficult to get through to Aldi customer services?Why, when they know goods can not be delivered to a customer is a refund not issued promptly and without a fight?If you do buy from them be very wary. I personally will never do it again.",0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi have an issue with goods getting “lost” and use a terrible delivery company XDP,"I ordered a ceramic egg bbq from Aldi online at end March (the one that is sold out). I waited 2 weeks then tried contacting the delivery company used by Aldi (XDP) and Aldi to find out where my order was. Xdp don’t respond to online chat and don’t answer the phone. XDP also charge for phone and I ran up a £5 charge while waiting on hold. Aldi have told me that XDP have told them my order has been “lost” but having read the reviews about XDP i suspect it’s been stolen as this seems to happen a lot with XDP. Aldi are refunding me but won’t reserve another bbq for me when they come back into stock. They’ve told me that they “can’t” do that, but of course they can, they just need to set up an internal process to do it. Aldi also won’t refund the £5 phone charge that their delivery company has charged me. I’ve asked Aldi to look into XDP in terms of this issue of losing things and also their phone charge and inability to contact them, but I’m pretty sure that nothing will be done which is why I am writing this review to raise awareness.",0,1

We were told to leave store before we could pay for our shopping and they took the trolly. I was called some very nasty names when i went back to store to collect a bag of shopping that was attached to the trolly i used which i had purchaced from another store. I was called a ""fat C**t"" by a female member of staff and was told my partner was homeless and could not afford 69p for a can of coke.

Aldi UK,Cuthbert would not be proud of your service.,Ordered a special buy but there was nothing special about it actually it never arrived - why do they keep using xpd delivery.

Aldi UK,What’s going wrong at Aldi?,"I’ve spent thousands of pounds at Aldi over the years but recently their products seem to be of terrible quality. Solar lights that don’t work, fresh meat and dairy products that go off well before the use by dates and plenty of out of date foods in the chillers left for sale. I’ve seen lamb joints two days out of date for sale in the fridges. I’ve also bought chicken and lamb which has been off when I’ve opened the packaging. Aldi does have good prices but it’s a false economy if the goods you buy aren’t useable. I always meticulously check before I’m buying fresh produce as I’ve become increasingly wary of trusting their refrigeration practices. This has been the case while shopping at 2 different stores so it’s not isolated to one shop. Aldi seriously need to get a grip.",0,1

Aldi UK,Great service on guaranteed parts,"Hi , I brought a water butt pump from Aldi 2 1/2 years ago and when I took it out of the water butt to clean the filter a plastic joint in the middle of the pipe that comes out from the pump snapped. I phoned Aldi customer service and they agreed it was still under the warranty and give me an email address to speak to the company that would deal with their warranty and right the next day that company emailed me back asking what part i needed, so I sent them a photo and then the next day they emailed me saying that the part was dispatched to my home . This company is called Walter workzeuge based in Austria . This happened on Thursday 22/04 and today 26/04 part arrived at my home . Now I don’t think anyone could moan about this service. Thanks to both companies.",0,5
Aldi UK,I Have Been ‘Ripped off’ by Aldi,"Next stop, Copying Giles Hurley Aldi CEO into an email to the TV Program Rip off Britain.Aldi have kindly taken my money for a purchase of a lawn mower which stopped working after my third usage. It is under a 3 year warranty with an associated company of Aldi called FERREX. I followed the warranty procedure and on 10th February 2021 I attempted to contact the FERREX After-Sales Support Department by their displayed phone number, I am partially sighted so phoning is my best method of contact. During my call I received an automated voice message saying that I needed to send an email to their support department. I was not happy with this and since I purchased my Lawnmower from Aldi, later that day I decided to phone them to ask why the Warranty Company does not answer their publish After-Sales Support Number. Aldi agreed to contact the company on my behalf and placed me on hold. Aldi seemed surprised to receive the email request message and suggested that I should try to send an email and in the meantime she would be trying to resolve the situation in-house. She said, under the circumstances she believes that Aldi's Warranty team could bypass FERREX by issuing a total refund or a repair. She explained that it may take a couple of weeks to hear a reply due to the backlog of work. I decided to wait since I prefer for obvious reasons to speak on the phone. I heard nothing from Aldi and unfortunately I went through an illness and was unable to send the email to the warranty company until 29th March 2021. It took me a while to put this email together. Once I sent it I then received an automated email from the company telling me that I had to go to their website to answer questions about the product, I struggled but I followed their instruction, it took me a very long time. After I completed the online form, the solution they came up with was not applicable for my situation. There was a note on their site which said, in different words, if I still required help I should go to their chat for assistance. This was just far too much. Why do I as a customer of Aldi have to go through all this hassle? It’s quite simple, my lawn mower has stopped working, it’s under warranty and that’s it.I was unable to get through Aldi until the 9th April 2021. I contacted them also on 13th April 2021 and my last call on 23rd April. Each call I spoke to two or 3 different people waiting in ques and being transferred and disconnected. I have been given so many false and promises misleading information but nothing has happened. Examples:1 Aldi’s Warranty department will be In-touch in 36 hours to resolve the issue (I found out later that I wasn’t even referred to the warranty department.)2 Again I was told that I have now been put in the Warranty que I should wait for 36 hours but nothing.3 I was told that I was transferred to the warranty department, the phone disconnected and despite them having my phone number they never called back. 4 Another person told me that Aldi’s customer’s service has no facility to transfer customers to the warranty department.5 On my last call I was promised that she would not stop until she spoke to the warranty team and they would be in touch that day. She said she’s working until 5pm and if she didn’t get through she would phone me herself to give me that message-no call no nothing.I have never ever known anything so unprofessional, the fact that I had to spend hours with my eyesight putting this information together it’s appalling.Right now having been a happy customer of Aldi for many years I now longer have any trust in them. If the matter is not fully resolved within the next Fourteen days then I can only assume that they are happy for me to proceed to go public with my experience to a wider audience.",0,1
Aldi UK,DO NOT ORDER LARGE ITEMS ONLINE!,"Ordered the rattan corner sofa from Aldi on 4/4/21 to be dispatched on 12/4/21. XDP emailed on the 14th to say they had collected the item. After weeks gone by of not receiving anything from XDP nor a reply to my 3 emails sent to them (as you can’t call them), I escalated to Aldi. They are chasing up with XDP but currently sounds like my sofa cannot be found! The staff I have spoken to are friendly and polite enough but no one can do anything to go out of their way to actually help!!! Which is basically what customer service means to me. I was given the option of having a refund if the item cannot be found but I will decline as we just want our sofa!!! We also ordered the 2 stools for £70 which were delivered by Hermes and these will be no use whatsoever to us without our sofa. We also cancelled an order with another online retailer (HUGE REGRET) once this order was dispatched. They now have no stock and garden furniture is a struggle to buy from everywhere now.

Aldi UK,Aldi Kamado bbq declared lost after 1 month waiting,"After all the excitement created around the Kamado bbq from Aldi, I managed purchased this item on 23rd March 2021 and after one month of wait, spending hours calling customer services and receiving false hopes of getting my bbq, last Thursday I received a call from a manager informing that my bbq had been lost and I would never receive it. They refunded me and gave me a voucher to spend on line, but I am obviously very unhappy with this solution. They failed the delivery time which was advertised 2-7 days and it took them one month to even call me. Through a forum I found out there were more customers in the same situation, so I feel completely ripped off. Not only this was disappointing, it is also frustrating to hear that neither Aldi nor XDP were able to find my order which was declared ‘lost’. We are talking about a product that weighs 75kg and considering how develop the logistics are now, I simply can’t understand how this has happened. I have now seen several Kamado bbq from Aldi being sold on EBay for £700 so whoever who has the ‘lost’ bbqs is making a lot of money.So much expectation about a product that you cannot guarantee... shame I didn’t check this site and I can see this has been an ongoing issue.I wouldn’t recommend anyone to purchase this product, the treatment given by Aldi has been really terrible.",0,1

Aldi UK,Worst customer experience ever,"Two online messed up.

Customer services told me three times they chased the courier but they had to give them 2 or 3 days to reply and they would ring me back. The was no notes or history kept with my order so it was going back to the beginning every time. Because items not returned to their warehouse I can’t even get a refund from ALDI. Both items are some of the harder to come by special buys from ALDI.... I see from other comments on social media and trust pilot that others are experiencing the same with the hard to come by items such as egg chair and BBQs. Where do these items end up I wonder? Are they actually real and how many actually are available? Are they say in the gardens of ALDI and/or XDP employees or their friends? ALDI not refunding so my money sat in their bank account earning interest and not in mine. Both times I stupidly bought other lower ticket items and I wonder if others do the same as me.

The 3 people who I spoke to in customer services no idea what’s going on, it appears they don’t keep notes on your order to communicate what’s going on. They say they will ring you back and they don’t. You are kept on hold for up to an hour, listening to the same song play on repeat. Their twitter team are no better, they take 2 weeks to reply and when they do it’s clear they haven’t read your messages correctly. A courier came to collect part 2 of my bed last week (Luckily I kept the box and had to dismantle it) but left no tracking info or proof they’ve actually collected it. Will I get a refund? Who knows?! Will I use aldi online again? Absolutely not. Avoid at all costs - In the mean time my 13 year old is sleeping on a mattress on the floor.

This person is still being vindictive and now Aldi won't respond to my messages.

They don't seem to have a good contact section on the website as I could only find a phone number at a quick look. When I called the help line they were particularly rude and unhelpfully telling us to travel to the store and then interact with as many people as possible in a pandemic. Eventually he told us the customer service e-mail where pictures were emailed and the issue explained. Eventually they replied with a voucher for just the chicken and not the other items or a sorry gift to apologise for the issues. They stated that they couldn't refund the value on the card for some poor excuse for requiring all the card details. Which this is not the case all they need is to be able to reverse a set amount on the transaction number, there are also many other ways to refund money. They also came up with a whole load of other fictional excuses that were just ludicrous. In addition the website is a complete pain to find what you want.

On this particular occasion, I was doing shopping with my 5-year-old daughter using the school voucher provided by the government to families on a low income. I used the self-checkout and after queuing and scanning all of my shopping one of the staff members told me I can't use a voucher here only at the tills. I told him the store is full and only two tills were open and it was unfair for me to queue all over again. There is nowhere that says we cannot use a voucher on the self-checkout system there is an option to use the voucher which I alerted them to. He shrugged his shoulders and walked off. I asked to speak to a manager. She came and told me no other cashiers are available to open another till and she walked off. I bagged all of my shopping and proceeded to queue again at the tills this time. I loaded the shopping onto the tills and I went away to grab something I had forgotten. When I had returned the manager was by the till crowding my daughter without a mask on. The staff were rude and extremely unhelpful, i challenged the manager as to why she was at the till crowding my daughter when she hadn't been of much assistance beforehand. she began to challenge me telling me its none of my business and told me she would not serve me when I am a single mother doing £22.98 shopping for dinner. The manager used gaslighting to police my tone of voice and behaviour. When I had done nothing wrong except display that I was upset. I became very distressed and so did my daughter and we left with nothing. I am very upset by this and I urge nobody to shop there.

There is a guard at the door but when I was there a young man with his mask under his chin instead on his face walked passed through the guard who pretended he didn't see him.

I spent hours out of my sleeping time to get the ‘must have’ item before it sold out, which it did in less than an hour. Chuffed with my success I told the children it was coming, and we sat patiently, and excitedly, awaiting the delivery, only to be disappointed. XDP Delivery attempt no. 1Notification arrived that item was out for delivery, then after waiting all day I get a notification saying unable to find the house (no one else struggles). When I checked the app it showed a picture of the neighbouring street! I attempted to add instructions for redelivery but it is not possible and you cannot contact them either.XDP Delivery attempt no.2Notification arrived yet again the item was out for delivery.... the time slot came and went.... 3hrs later (8.42pm) I get a notification of another failed delivery! I have waited all day! Same thing, cannot find the house. They do not call and you cannot call them..... oh and if you miss a third then that’s it.... item returned never to be seen again.....Delivery attempt no. 3Called Aldi to ask for help before I rescheduled delivery. They tried to make contact with XPD but said they can only email them and that after three attempts we would lose the item... and then they decided to send it the final time! To try and guarantee receipt I camped out where they seem to drive to, sat there for over 4hrs, then guess what.... at 20:15 the status suddenly changed to ‘Carded, Unable to deliver’....... they hadn’t been to the house, or their preferred location this time, just didn’t turn up at all.I got home to children in tears, panicking about their prized Hot Tub, and I felt awful! How could Aldi let this happen.Delivery Attempt No. 4So i called again, pleading for their help as not only was it ridiculous, but it was making me ill with all the stress. I was told there was nothing Aldi can do other than to send an email to them, and that if XDP mark it as Return to Sender, that would be it and we would be refunded. I don’t want a refund, I want the product I have paid for and invested a lot of time and effort into getting!The dreaded text then arrived again...... ‘your Aldi order is out for deliver and will be with you today’! What could I do? This was my last hope..... so I went on stakeout again...... my husband manning the front door of the house, me sat in the neighbouring road...... 4 more hours of pain...... watching the deliveries before me slowly reduce one by one..... then it came to us as the next delivery and suddenly the status changed to ‘delivered’! Oh no it wasn’t....... much to my utter disappointment the consignment note then showed the dreaded RTS...... Return to Sender. I feel physically sick, our children are distraught, and I have wasted hours and hours purely trying to get a ‘Special Buy’. Doesn’t feel like I’m one of the lucky ones anymore. The whole thing is a disgrace, Aldi should be ashamed of themselves for letting this happen, and XDP should be put out of business, no company should use them, they are a complete disgrace.One for Watchdog I think!",0,1

Aldi UK,Mould in Aldi orange juice,"My daughter had the orange juice for breakfast and complained it tasted funny. Later on in the day she started being sick and was quite ill all day I didn’t think too much of it until I went to drink the orange juice myself and it was a funny colour I tipped it down the sink and to my disgust something in the carton rattled So I cut it open and to my disgust found some sort of white fungus/mould in it, it was vile. I have four cartons of this orange juice. The second carton I checked was also a funny colour which I tipped down the sink. I can’t face the other two. I am considering getting this substance independently checked as to what it actually is? I had something similar before with milk tasting sour but never complained just tipped it away but this was not on when it made my daughter sick. My mom also had two cartons at the same time which was also a funny colour so there is definitely something wrong with the batch, I had a reply from Aldi but no refund?",0,1
Aldi UK,Consistently bad fresh produce,"Consistently bad fresh produce. Aldi's fresh fruit and veg is appalling. I think its perfectly reasonable to expect fruit and vegetables to last 4 or 5 days after purchase before it starts to go off. I have shopped at Aldi for some time, normally a weekly shop, in the vast majority of those cases I've had to throw food away as its gone off within days. In some cases its already going mouldy in store and you only find out when you get home and unpackage it.A classic example from this week. I bought two packets of on the vine tomatoes. Three days later I've had to throw half of them away as they have already gone mouldy. At the same time I bought a bag of carrots, 2 days later they had already started to turn and go soft. Aldi like to advertise that they offer produce at an unbeatable price, undercutting their competitors, but its absolutely pointless if you're having to throw so much away! That is NOT value for money.",0,1
Aldi UK,Your not going to get Waitrose in-store…,"Your not going to get Waitrose in-store level care at Aldi😀, it's all about reducing the cost base that gives you the lowest priced items. Very difficult to do a complete shop here, but many of their core products are great value. Veg super 6,fresh meats, cured meats, cheese, breads and yoghurts especially. Yes, you do get the products almost thrown at you at checkout and they are faster than gunslingers in the wild west, but I kind of like that. Its an occasional vistit here, but always a good backup option to have and I am sure the pricing really makes a difference for many people on a weekly shop. Competition is always good.",0,4

Aldi UK,Speedy resolution from customer services,"I ordered the Kamado Caramic Egg BBQ online on 26 March, with a 2-7 working day delivery timescale. The Easter bank holiday weekend fell in between so I gave Aldi some leeway for delivery time, however 14 days later it had still not been delivered and there had been no updates on the tracking. I contacted customer services on 15 April and spoke to Tarek, who resolved the issue incredibly swiftly. He said I would receive a phone call to confirm delivery for the next day. However the delivery arrived the same day I called customer services. Tarek also refunded the delivery fee. I suppose the issue was with the courier service rather than Aldi themselves however I was very impressed with the speedy resolution by Tarek - thank you.",0,5

Poor service overall and took 4-5 weeks to resolve.,0,1
Aldi UK,Received Poor quality chair and Bad Serviceconfirmation e-mail from Aldi…,"Received confirmation e-mail from Aldi on Monday 12th April to confirm the chair will be delivered the next day (three days later that confirmed) I called Aldi and after 45 minutes my call was answered, only then I had to wait another 15 minutes to be connected to customer service. I explained that they had the incorrect address and please could they update which they did and confirmed they had contact their warehouse/disbatch deptartment. On Tuesday the chair was delivered to the incorrect address so I called Aldi again only to wait another 45 minutes. I was informed that they could not do anything until the end of the week and then it would be returned to the warehouse and I would be refunded. I asked why thay can not delivered it to me as I have paid for, but their was nothing they could do, not very helpful though he was polite. A friend collected the chair for me and it was faulty as one of the holes on the underside did not line up and I had to some diy which took 20 mins. This is my second very poor experience with Aldi and will never purchase anything via their website",0,1

Aldi UK,Sofa missing key part,I tried to leave the following review word for word on the Aldi website against a rattan sofa but it was rejected by moderators so I'll leave it here instead. I think the review was fair:-I thought I was one of the lucky ones to have been able to get one of these until it arrived. It arrived with 2 x left arm rests instead of 1 left arm and 1 right arm. It will be 4 weeks before they can send me the right part. Until then I have paid all this money for something I cant even assemble. I will update if/ when I get the part I need.,0,1
Aldi UK,Warning!!! Exploding glass table - warranty means nothing!,"We bought a garden table and chairs last summer. It was inspected meticulously for flaws on arrival as I’d heard stories of people receiving ones that had cracks or flaws causing them to break. We used it for a few months before putting it into our garage to store over winter. Last week we heard a loud bang - and went into the garage to discover the glass top had exploded - sending broken glass across our entire garage. Aldi have refused to honour the so called “3 year warranty” on it as there were no witnesses to the event. On the one hand I’m relieved - had there been witnesses - my 3 or 6 year old for example - they would no doubt have been seriously injured. However the “no witnesses” comeback means that I’m without a table, without recompense in the form of a refund or replacement, and with a garage full of broken glass. We are still finding pieces in boxes or our children’s toys a week later. Our garden is really important to us, having been our safe space during the past year and somewhere we can spend time as a family following a difficult health diagnosis for our youngest son last year, and sitting out to eat together is an important part of that. This is a thoroughly disappointing excuse for customer services - we bought in confidence knowing it had a 3 year warranty which it turns out means absolutely nothing. Will certainly not be shopping at Aldi again and warning everyone not to waste their money or risk injuring their loved ones with similar items from them. If you do this is the kind of care and “customer service” you can expect from them.",0,1
Aldi UK,Blindfolded pickers? Loooong hold for support,Ordered a couple dozen bottles of red wine (needed to fill the rack!) online as not all are stocked in store.

Come on Aldi you can do better than this!,0,1
Aldi UK,Shop here at your own risk.,"In a nut shell, you are getting what you are paying for in Aldi. It is like the wild wild west in the Kingsbury branch. First of all there are regular almost monthly and some times weekly stabbings or shootings around the entrance to the store and it's car park. There is almost always a beggar sitting in the alleyway by the entrance or nearby. In times before lockdown, there was a daily group of drug dealers hanging around beside the store. Although this is not the store's responsibility, a small number of the store's customers and staff behaviour is reflecting this lawlessness. The products are inarguably good quality and value in most cases, but the culture and ethos for the customers is more or less any behaviour goes. The weekly specials bins are always a mess and mostly empty or stocked up with out-of-season stock which has sat around for months and months. Either items are not clearly priced (lack of correct displays or items not where they should be). Plants are unwatered and dead or dying, but remain for sale at the shop entrance at the original full price. Packaging is often tampered with or destroyed on items. The staff often don't know where certain fresh goods may be displayed so they will just reply if the customer cannot find or see it, then they don't have it. Often it is in stock, they just did not bother to find out where it is. The most perturbing letdown of all though is the attitude of the management and aptitude of the security. It is a frequent almost if not daily occurrence for any customer to initiate and escalate any aggressive attack they wish over any given reason as they wish in-store, without any objection or concern from the staff, security, and most of all the management. The staff act as if nothing is happening and the rest of the staff are the same. In the words of the management ""it is not our job to do anything"". And ""It is not the security guard's job to stop it or throw anyone out"". This means no shopper is their responsibility. Each time you step into that store, you are wavering expectations for any safety and wellbeing. The management make no apology for this, and the staff has reflected or accepted this.",0,1
Aldi UK,Absolutely hopeless purchased garden…,Absolutely hopeless purchased garden bench on special buy. Item delivered missing 4 screws. Attempted to contact customer services on four occasions.

Ridiculous customer service",0,1
Aldi UK,Red Label Tea Bags leaking tea powder,"I have recently written a review on the Aldi website, being constructive about the quality of their Red Label Tea. In the past it has been excellent but recently the boxes have shown a large amount of tea dust in them with splitting tea bags being the problem. I noticed that the lamination between the two paper faces were not in places sticking together properly and thus leaking out tea. I explained this in my review but got no response from Aldi. I then wrote a second review offering helpful advice and my willingness to return the box so that the batch number could be compared to when the production line made the tea bag. However my second review was rejected on the grounds that it didn't meet Aldi's guidelines and as a result they would not publish it. As a point of interest here are the 1st and 2nd (rejected) reviews: No.1 Says this, ""Normally I enjoy the flavour from this product. However the last box of red label tea bags showed a lot of tea powder in the box. It eventually came to my notice that certain bags are not sealed properly during production. Also bags which appear to be sealed when making the tea have separated leaving powdery tea in the drink.. Eventually I will make a special journey to take them back to Aldi, but at the moment its the only tea I have so will have to make the best of it until I can make the journey to go in. But powdery tea has also gone all over the place, resulting in taking away any enjoyment from this product"".No.2 (and rejected) Says this, ""As explained in my review, I have enjoyed the tea but not when it has been spilling out of the bags more recently. Its spoilt my tea, left a lot of fine tea in my caddy spilling everywhere and the red label box also has spilt tea scattered throughout. All the reviews written thus far mention leaking tea from the bags. I would have thought it would be in Aldi's interest to deduct that there must be a problem in the lamination process of the paper bags during manufacture. I can easily return the product carton back to the Aldi store and the accompanying batch number should help to identify the problem on the line during manufacture""Surely my comment were only constructive and as a scientist, I am only trying to help them solve the problem with their production process. I am just amazed why some people just do not want to listen.",0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi does not like negative reviews if…,"Aldi does not like negative reviews if it's about their company and online experience as opposed to products. I tried leaving 3 negative reviews regarding my experience of trying to buy the infamous egg chair and on all three occasions Aldi didn't publish saying it breached their policies. The reviews essentially said that despite not being in a queue on the site, still not being able to purchase the chair as the buy button not appearing and then sold out in minutes. My reviews also said that Aldi know how popular the chairs are so should plan ahead in terms of stock levels.Plus limit purchases to one per customer - some shoppers left reviews gloating how they purchased between 2 to 6 chairs and sold all but one on for £100-150 profit, unfairly depriving shoppers like me who just want one for themselves.I hope potential buyers from those people cotton on and leave those unscrupulous shoppers with 6 chairs that they can't get rid of. However, given the comments on here, it looks like I've had a lucky escape from having to deal with potentially damaged product and poor customer service, which I'm not surprised about given how they don't like criticism.

Aldi UK,"Real sneaky, Aldi","Firstly, let me say that my one-star rating concerns a specific, not Aldi generally, to which I would normally give 5* I have been ordering wine online from Aldi for years. Delivery is always free if you spend more than £30. Then last week I was more than irritated to discover that Aldi had started charging £4.95 for its wine delivery, no matter how much you spent. What irritated me even more was the fact that Aldi suddenly introduced this delivery charge, with no prior warning. I am a long-standing customer who must have spent many hundreds on Aldi wine and felt that I (and everyone else who has Aldi wine delivered) deserved better than this cheap shot. Did they think I wouldn't notice? Curious how Aldi's marketing department finds the time to email me several times a week with promo messages, but somehow couldn't find the time to do me the courtesy of telling me what they were planning. So, it's goodbye from me, Aldi. I'm voting with my feet, as I suspect will many others.",0,1

I know it's cheap and fast but you still deserve an appropriate amount of care and service surely. Queued in the bread and cereal isle and listened to a cashier shouting to customers what checkout to go to. This made it impossible to purchase properly as you have to grab items whilst queuing down the isle which is weird. (to then see some customers ignore the silly queue idea and go unchallenged to a checkout tells you the system fails). My main complaint is I end up being told to unload at the checkout with the girl shouting at people which till to go to. So I unload. I ready my 4 bags open in my trolley to quickly place my shopping directly into (like everyone does) now I am a quick person but she is so busy looking at the tills and queues an busy concentrating on telling people where yo go that after she scans, she ends up making my shopping fall on the floor. I pick it up and say nothing. Then it happens again. I say nothing. 3rd time, I say can you please stop chucking my shopping on the floor. The reply I get is that I should pack the Aldi way and should not be bagging my shopping implying that I'm too slow. I'm fuming. I glance behind me to the packing areas (the store is packed, people queuing outside to get in) and its empty. I look around at the other shoppers at the checkouts who are all packing directly into their bags. I then say that no one is doing this and its just as quick and it makes no difference. I get the same response. No apology. Disgusting.",0,1

Now that the egg chairs are once again sold out a replacement will be hard to come by. I am banging my head against a brick wall. Despite various promises that someone from online will get in touch with you, nothing has materialised! It is always me calling them, waiting over 45 mins and listening to patronising music.

Aldi UK,I am done with Aldi,"I have been shopping at Aldi in Northwich since it opened and I have gradually got more and more disillusioned. I know the trade-off for slightly cheaper groceries is less customer service, but Aldi takes this to extremes. Rarely are the staff particularly friendly but they are consistently inconsiderate. I regularly have to manoeuvre a full trolley around staff who walk straight at me or cut me off with pallets, but the worst is the tills. The constant shouting at and ordering around of customers just gets me down. Today a till operator was so busy ordering people about that her queue was stood there for a good 5 minutes. Said operator then sent a couple in front of me to a different till not knowing that there was a mother there with a full trolley and a young baby. The couple were then rudely told they had gone to the wrong till (they hadn't) and I was then even more rudely told I had to let them back in front of me as they were there first. None of these things matter in the great scheme of things, but it is enough for me, I won't bother with Aldi again, I am back to Sainsbury's from now on.

Aldi UK,Aldi in my opinion have some very…,"Aldi in my opinion have some very worrying practises in place. I purchased a power drill first job was to re-charge the device however clearly the drill had been used because on the instruction manual the original purchaser perhaps? had written ""Not Working"" and returned it, so what did Aldi staff do, clearly they put it back on the shelf for some poor unfortunate (me) to purchase.Month's ago when the government gave supermarkets strict operational instructions on their responsibilities to customers and staff namely that security staff MUST be employed to monitor volumes of customers, one shopper rule entering their store's and ensure customers wear a mask, sadly Aldi in my opinion have failed to comply, someone did a runner with a bottle of booze a staff member ran after him but he was away, I asked a staff member where is your security guard, his response was deeply concerning, security staff are not in store every day, a couple of times a week max, these people see an opportunity, no security on the entrance which results in people helping themselves and running off unchallenged.In respect of the lack of security issue I decided to complain to the ALDI MD month's & month's ago. A Giles Hurley. despite sending multiple emails I failed to get a simple acknowledgement or a response it was totally ignored, perhaps Aldi feel they are exempt and the strict compliance rule does not apply to them, next time you visit an Aldi store have a look for the traffic light system above the door and security on the entrance, my opinion is they have a handful of security staff that work an area but not on a permanent basis but on an Aldi rota. Finally a pattern is emerging here of a shameful lack of concern & respect for it's customers and staff, putting returned faulty items back on the shelf tells me all I need to know about Aldi, and remember the food is not the only thing CHEAP at Aldi.",0,1
Aldi UK,Unorganised and unhelpful. So difficult to cancel an order.,"I ordered a Gardenline Kettle BBQ from their website. It wasn’t going to arrive in time so I bought one from the local garden centre and rang up to cancel my order. My order at the time was still ‘processing’ and able to be cancelled so I waited for an hour and a half on hold to their helpline to cancel. (The hold music is terrible btw). A lovely lady picked up and told me she was able to cancel the order and I’ll receive a full refund. I thought it was done and dusted. However, nope, the next day I received an email saying they weren’t able to cancel my order but I would be able to refuse delivery, or return the item to a local store for a full refund. Well, the day turned up, and they delivered this bbq to the wrong address! Luckily a neighbour saw it, but they delivered it 100m away from our house on the side of a busy road. I’m surprised it didn’t get stolen! I wasn’t able to refuse delivery because of this. I then went to their store to return it only to be told by the manager that Aldi online is different to their stores and the stores don’t have this bbq on their system so they’re unable to process a refund. And now I have to ring up their helpline again to arrange a collection. I am absolutely disgusted with how unorganised they are. A simple request to cancel has turned into this fiasco. I am seriously reconsidering whether I want to order again from Aldi.UPDATE: emailed them and after waiting more than a week they haven’t replied so I rang them up. They said they’ll send me an email so I can arrange a collection for return but this email hasn’t arrived. They also tried to fight me on the fact that I wouldn’t get refunded my £10 delivery charge, even though they said in emails they would. I had to forward them their OWN emails to prove that they said that. What a joke. Now I need to ring them again to sort this return out as this other email is no where to be seen. This company is so disorganised and doesn’t treat their customers right at all. Once they have your money, they don’t want to do anything to give it back.",0,1

(Even though it clearly states on the website ‘back in stock soon’... I was very disappointed to hear this after waiting in the queue online for this egg chair so I think it is only fair that I am sent a replacement as through no fault of my own it has gone missing and I should be made a priority rather than being asked to queue again online! Aldi said again they can’t send me a replacement and will have to issue me a refund.

So on Easter Sunday when the MD of Aldi is sitting with his family tucking into Eggs we will have none.Thanks for Ruining Easter Aldi.Held for 20mins to speak to customer service who couldnt care less and offered me a voucher , thats going to be fun for an easter egg hunt.",0,1
Aldi UK,Still waiting for refund,"Ordered a keyboard and mouse, it arrived minus the dongle. Aldi were very helpful, although I had to wait a long time on the phone. I received a replacement free of charge but that had the same problem so I phoned again, said I wanted a refund and was told Hermes would collect the parcel the next day, which they did. I am yet to receive a credit for this item and it's now been 2 weeks. I e-mailed last week and was told I would get a reply within 5 working days, but I haven't. Have tried all day to phone but the line is constantly engaged. I have been happy with online deliveries from them in the past but don't think I'll be ordering again.",0,1

I felt so terrible I saw that poor man leave the store still trying too smile n out fast as he could. I paid for my shopping and then I told this kath I would be putting in a complaint because I felt her treatment of him was racist because she abused the fact that she knew he could not defend himself with the right English words . When I left I went outside and this lovely man stopped me and he said thank you so much for yr kindness he said I shop here often and always am I treated this poorly by the staff who work there. Banbury Aldi you need too re train yr staff with some thoughtfulness and kindness or put these people to work cleaning out the toilets and stacking shelves because clearly they should not be dealing with human being ..

Aldi UK,Complaint & Refund Ignored by Aldi,"I purchased from Aldi a Sous-vide stick covered by a three year warranty. Within the first year of infrequent use the item developed a fault, thus unfit for purpose. Aldi Customer Services Agent asked me to contact the German Manufacturer directly. The German manufacturer then informed Aldi Warranty Team that they would replace the faulty item when it would be back in stock. But no timescale available. After many telephone calls to Aldi customer services over a period of 7 weeks and several request to speak to a Manager, as well as lodging a formal complaint. Aldi eventually agreed to the collection of the faulty item and a full refund. Ten weeks on, after first reporting the fault, the return of the item, the promise of a refund and no call back from Aldi managers. I am still left in limbo. Aldi Customer Service is appalling and should certainly review the way they treat their customers. The 3 year warranty on their electrical products is absolutely worthless. They are in breach of contract.",0,1

As this was a 24 mile round trip I left it until I needed to shop in Aldi again, six weeks later. I was told that Customer Services generally deal with refunds. The store needed to do the refund to the credit card that we did the original Click and Collect purchase on, which we didn't have because we use a special credit card for online purchases.

Aldi UK,Down Hill Quality Of Food,"Really disappointed with ALDI. I’ve been shopping here for many years now, however we’ve had a few bad experiences with quality of food, we’ve purchased.Firstly me and my boyfriend bought a pack of microwaveable rice, when we got home and opened it, it was all green and mouldy. Secondly we bought a packet of whole meal pitta bread, only to find dark little trimmings of what looked like beard hair, hidden on top of one of the pittas. Thirdly the fresh fruit and the frozen veg tastes bland and dried out, and there’s always hard bits in the mixed veg. While the fresh chicken, always seem to have a funny taste to it. And when you fry it you always have to get some kitchen roll to soak all the juice up what comes out of it. There’s also been a lot of occasions, that the chicken has gone off, when it’s been in date. However it’s such a shame, because the customer service, in the stores have always been 100%, and the home ware range is really good. Unfortunately for me, I have recently changed, and now shop at Tesco. Yes I do have to pay that little bit extra with Tesco, but I would rather pay the extra for good quality food, rather than buy bad quality, and just waste money, by throwing food in the bin.",0,1

He called the manager who was so rude. He said I have to return it so I can’t take money off. He could not even be bothered to look at me.

Aldi UK,Stressful experience,"I am extremely annoyed about an order I placed with Aldi, part of which was supposed to be delivered by Yodel today. I received part of this order, delivered by Hermes, earlier in the week. I received an e-mail earlier today saying this parcel would be delivered this morning. When I clicked through to Yodel to track it, the website said there were seven deliveries ahead of me. I assumed it would be delivered shortly but it did not arrive and I tracked it again. I then discovered there were no stops before me and shortly afterwards received an e-mail to say it had been delivered. I have checked everywhere, My door bell has not rung and there is no parcel anywhere near my house. Exactly the same thing happened on the last 2 occasions I have ordered wine from you to be delivered to my home. The driver insisted he had delivered these and I had signed for the deliveries, when he had not and I had not, and customer service did not believe me. Fortunately I was contacted by people who had had it delivered to them. They were people who lived some way away and they had been delivered to two separate addresses some distance away from each other. I am very angry this has happened a third time, and it is not for me to go driving around Winchester to ask if it has been delivered to another address, especially in lockdown. It is impossible to speak to a person at Yodel and I have phoned Aldi customer service and was forced to hold on to the telephone for 51 minutes and gave up as i could not be sure it would ever be answered.Unless you enjoy being stressed out and wasting time i suggest you do not order wine deliveries from Aldi. For it to happen once is unfortunately but I ask why they did not deal with the problem when it was reported previously.I would just add that i wrote to the MD and customer services and no response.

Aldi UK,Bought two Philips Sonicare…,"Bought two Philips Sonicare toothbrushes on offer and only one arrived. The package had been damaged and taped back up by Hermes, so one may have fallen out with the delivery note or possibly stolen? I have been trying to contact Customer Services for over a week, I've sent multiple emails, photographs of the damaged packet and wasted an hour and a quarter on hold on the telephone today (25/03). No response from emails or the telephone, totally useless Customer Service and i'm short £50 worth of goods. On this occasion, Aldi don't even deserve 1 Star, but that's as low as it will go. The items weren't even properly packaged, they were sent in a thin plastic bag that gave no protection to the contents inside, so based on my online shopping experience i'd advise even my worst enemy to avoid Aldi online!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,I will not be buying from them online…,I will not be buying from them online again.Ordered a cold frame online on 8/3 and had an email saying it had been dispatched on 11/3 and have heard nothing since and the item was not received. 3 emails to them and weeks later with no response. Tried two phone calls to customer service where I was waiting for over an hour with no response so gave up holding. Why don’t they get more staff !!! I will have to try chargeback with my credit card company to see whether I can get my money back. Absolutely appalling if not total lack of customer service support.,0,1
Aldi UK,Great first online food shop!,"I ordered groceries online for the first time with Aldi. I am a regular once weekly online shopper with Ocado and Tesco. Other shoppers complain in reviews. Yes, the website is a bit plain. They have fewer items than other shops and actually it makes shopping easier. I found everything I wanted, what I normally shop in store no problems adding it to my basket and it did not take any longer than using other sites. I know Aldi is new to this. I guess they are trying it out to see if it takes off for them. Other websites long ago when online shopping first arrived were not much better, I know they will develop their site with increased demand. My food was well packed, the staff member was super friendly and helpful (thanks Suszanne). Communication from Aldi was fabulous and clear. Overall a great experience!",0,5

Aldi UK,DISGUSTED with CUSTOMER SERVICE,"After placing an order online for a special buy product, my order arrived promptly today, thank you. However, even though I received the correct electrical product, the attached delivery note was for a completely different order.On 23/03/2021 I telephoned the customer service dept., and eventually after around 47 minutes of waiting in a queue someone answered my call. I explained to the lady about the incorrect delivery note and asked if they could post the correct delivery note to me. The electrical product is guaranteed for 3 years, so I obviously wanted the proof of purchase of a) the item does not work when I first use it or b) the item develops a fault during the 3 yr guarantee period.The lady took my details and put me on hold whilst she went to speak to someone. Unfortunately, she never returned and I was left on hold for approx. 9 minutes and then the call was disconnected! In total the length of my telephone call was 58 minutes long! I'm disgusted that a customer is treated in this manner.I've now filled in an online form, so will see how Aldi respond.UPDATE 02/04/2021 - Aldi have not had the courtesy to reply to the case that I opened online via their website, so I've now had to send an email. I need to return the product as it's faulty, but until they send me the correct delivery note that has a returns form attached I'm unable to do this. Might as well have flushed my money down the toilet!",0,1

This has become really frustrated, as I have received no goods that I have paid for and my money is stuck with Aldi. Really frustrated right now. Wish I had never bought from them and paid extra somewhere else. Worst experience of my life!

Aldi UK,"ALDI Wines - Unreliable, Unhelpful","I placed 2 orders for wines with ALDI wines. On both occasions, I received only part (about half) of my order. The not-delivered wines were in stock, all the money was taken, but then part of the order failed to arrive. I checked afterwards and the cancelled wines remained available for online purchase and were in stock.The money difference was returned quite quickly, BUT when I order wine, I want to receive it. No explanation was given with or before the delivery. I contacted ALDI Wines customer service and they too had no explanation, claiming to have passed on the complaint to the appropriate department for investigation. After two weeks, I reminded them about their commitment to investigate, but did not even receive a response from customer service. I live in Wales; the wines were on the list for Wales, available for online purchase and delivery in Wales and did not fall foul of our idiotic 50p a unit rule. Summer is coming, the BBQ's will be out and we like to have a glass or two of wine. We just cannot trust ALDI to deliver what is ordered, so will give them a miss from now on. Cheers!",0,2

Aldi UK,Gray ottoman bed from Aldi,"I purchased a gray ottoman bed from Aldi because I’d read newspaper reviews online and the price was really good. The saying you get what you pay for.... well. The bed was delivered over two days in a builders van when the packaging clearly said send box 1 and 2 together. We spent over two hours trying to put it together (and we have had IKEA items)to find that the middle part was damaged it did slot together and kept squeaking. I rang customer services and they could not tell me when the part could be replaced so I asked them to arrange collections for a refund. The bed was picked up on the 18th February, I have rang customer services numerous time since then to ask about my refund they always gave an excuse. It’s now the 22nd March nearly five weeks later and I’m still waiting for a refund. This was the first time I have ordered from Aldi on line and the last. I will never do it again customer service is terrible. I tried to put this review on the Aldi website they would not allow it. So I cut it down still wouldn’t accept it. They say it does not meet with their guidelines. What because it’s not a good review.",0,1

Aldi UK,The Aldi Click and Collect website is abysmal,"The Aldi Click and Collect website is one of the worst shopping web sites I have ever had the misfortune to use. The terrible design makes it very, very slow to buy stuff and it's obviously based on an outdated Microsoft server as I continually receive ASP/.Net errors (the web developers could not even be bothered to set up a proper customised error page!). In addition sometimes it is just not possible to buy goods. They are there but click buy/add and nothing happens. Then it goes very slow and then it stops. And then you have to log out, clear cookies and hope that when you try to log in again it will actually let you.It really is dire. It's almost worth paying the extra to do click and collect at Waitrose as their web site is infinitely better and so much faster to use.",0,1
Aldi UK,You get what you pay for ...,"I think Aldi proves the maxim you get what you pay for. Prices overall are a bit less expensive than Tesco and if you buy branded goods the quality will of course be adequate. However, if you buy the non-branded products they will be okayish but recognizably inferior to the branded items they mimic. In my opinion Aldi's non-branded goods are inferior to the comparable non-branded Tesco items. For example both sell tins of rice pudding for 20 pence. The Tesco product tastes like rice pudding and the Aldi product tastes like liquid sugar. I suppose that's okay if you like liquid sugar - but I prefer rice pudding. I personally don't like Aldi car parks because they are cramped and stressful. Squeeze in as many cars into as small a space as possible is the Aldi way. All in all Aldi is okay and if you're on a tight budget they do have an extended range of non-branded lookalikes. Thankfully, my budget isn't that constrained at the moment and I prefer Tesco for both branded and non-branded lines.",0,3

Aldi UK,What a shocking experience I've just…,What a shocking experience I've just had at Aldi Click and Collect. 1. Bag liners; to start with and what the executive probably approved the food was in bags. this week without warning they have changed to bag liners which just means that the food was then left to roll around the boot of my car.2. Sunday morning shop and no large Chicken for a roast: this means that I now I have to go to Tesco and buy something for lunch.3. NO substitutes: I also need to go out later now and purchase pack lunch for my daughter tomorrow for school as nothing has been substituted for her lunch.All this and I paid 500% more than Tesco charges.,0,1
Aldi UK,Click and Collect Refund for Leaking Products,"Click and Collect - a bottle of their Powerforce cleaner leaked all over the shopping as it has such a cheap mechanism (the nipple from the dispenser was missing). So everything was soaked and tainted with an awful strong smell.On ringing them up, they apologised and said they would send a voucher out to me. That was over 3 weeks ago and nothing received.If this had been Tesco or one of the other supermarkets it would of been refunded without question and dealt with on the phone.Aldi have lost me as a future customer as demonstrated by their complete lack of honesty or care. So they will lose thousands and thousands of pounds from me alone - I'm glad I have a choice and that they will now suffer as a result.

Aldi UK,Discount Customer Service & Online Division,"Aldi are often called a discount retailer, but that is referring to their products, it also extends to their online retail division and customer service department, who never reply to your emails and complaints made via their website. When you call them directly they come across as indifferent and unconcerned, even though they have broken the law.Aldi have charged me for goods not received for an order dating back to February 2021. They have taken my money but have not given me the goods for which I have paid for. This is illegal. I have contacted their customer services several times but to no avail. They do not appear to wish to resolve this issue. This website states that Aldi have not responded to negative customer reviews for 12 months. This indicates that they do not care. Companies with this attitude need more than bad reviews to force a response. I strongly urge everyone with similar grievances to report them to the relevant authorities such as Trading Standards. This is the worst example of 'customer service' I have ever experienced and I am absolutely appalled.",0,1

Aldi UK,Awful product and awful customer service. Never buy electrical equipment from Aldi,"I bought a new 4K 50inch tv from Aldi online in August 2020. It stopped functioning in late December, but came back to life again within a week. Then it stopped functioning again in January 2021 and hasn’t worked properly since. The tv frequently doesn’t react to the remote (it’s not the batteries in the remote). If it does respond to the remote (immediately after fitting brand new batteries) the tv freezes in app, doesn’t respond to the remote, the screen goes blank and after 15 minutes or so switches itself off. The tv ‘loses’ the apps I’veI’ve loaded and the mechanism for reloading, then they all come back sometime later - could be hours, days or weeks before they come back. I’ve tried for the last 3 months to get Medion and Aldi to do something about this to no avail. The customer service is awful. Every email is ignored, phone calls are cut off, nobody takes responsibility for dealing with the problem and every time you get put back into a 72 hour response time but nobody ever responds. It was a mistake buying from Aldi, and Aldi online. Customer services service is woeful - very “computer says no” attitude, and there is no escalation process when the response is poor. Customer services say I can’t take the tv back to the shop because I bought it online and nobody online will deal with the problem. My next step after being ignored yet again this week by Aldi who promised faithfully they would respond within 72 hours is to complain to my local Trading Standards. I will never buy electrical products from Aldi again and I will take my food shopping customer somewhere else too.",0,1

On examining underneath the microwave I noticed a bolt was protruding from the casing. I returned it back to store. The staff were really helpful and I was offered a full refund.I phoned customer service to highlight the problem because I believed there was quality assurance issue. I expected them to, at least take my details but they did not. I tried to put a review onto their website but it was declined, hence I have entered it on here instead.

This obviously irritated her and she glared at me and sighed loudly.I made my way to the till and she walked down the narrow till Isle, she was about half a meter away from me. That's absolutely disgusting. As she served me she grunted a morning as sarcastically as she could. Asked me how I was paying by saying ""cash or card"" as abruptly as possible.

Aldi UK,Manner less and unthankful,All was well until the cashier on the till made no eye contact and no hella upon paying again no acknowledgement so I said you are welcome he shook his head making a Hick sound was disgusted by his behaviour So called customer service for basic manner and acknowledgement Adam picks up the call 24 min into hold called dropped I called again Adam picks up again said he will call back if it drops guess what no call back and I don't even know if he registered my complain as attitude matters .Now I m more angry not one 2 departments would be choosing anyone but THIS STORE,0,1
Aldi UK,Bought a laptop from Aldi - never delivered,"Bought a laptop from Aldi. They no longer sell through stores for some reason, and told 3-5 days for delivery. SIX days later the Aldi warehouse reluctantly it seemed let it go to a courier company who I'll make sure I never use again if I can help it, and there it stayed. No movement. EMailed Aldi who said delivery was now 3-7 days which is ludicrous, as well as the long wait for warehouse to dispatch it. I rang Aldi customer service and was told its now even longer, I have to wait a week so they can say this laptop conveniently was ""lost"" by the courier who the customer services say they have no number for. First time I have used Aldi deliveries and it'll be the last. Absolutely appalling. Took the money quickly enough but slow to deliver and no interest if you got what you paid for or notNow I'm waiting for tomorrow for end of ""7 days"" (past the delivery time THEY stated) when I'll ring up and have to start another long business to get my money back while the laptop stays at XDP not moving, while Aldi does nothingI have never, ever had a ""service"" quite THIS badIf I could have awarded minus points instead of 1, I would haveGot fed up and decided to cancel this now instead of wait til tomorrow as 2 weeks waiting for something to be delivered that was coming from THIS country was beyond reasonable. Now I have to wait for Aldi online to actually honour this as they've shown no signs of caring for customers thus far.Update: A week later and they still haven't refunded me. I'm going to ring them again tomorrow to find out what the hell they're playing atUpdate 2: Now 3 weeks and after sending TWO emails to CEO, I got a reply stating that while the couriers acknowledged they have done NOTHING. But Aldi are saying the laptop - which seems to have mysteriously disappeared - must be returned before I am given my refund. In other words they are making ME responsible for the couriers losing my laptop. You couldn't make this up ! Are XDP just not answering hoping Aldi and I would just forget it and write off MY £380 ? Aldi seems quite happy to allow me to be ripped off, rather than get onto this courier.Finally got my refund with the help of a nice lady at Aldi, who unlike others, stuck at it for me. But why did it have to take a month ? And where did my laptop disappear to ?",0,1

Aldi UK,Never been more unhappy with a company,"Never been more unhappy with a company or it’s customer service. Ordered the scalloped bed as soon as it was available, the base was delivered however the headboard was not. I was advised just a headboard could not be sent but the base had to be collected and the order put through again. The collection was organised the first time and they never showed up meaning I had to call yet again. I was told to call back as soon as the bed had been collected and they would arrange for a new one to be delivered as soon as they had confirmation it was collected. I have had to call around 15 times since then (having to wait up to 40 minutes in a queue sometimes) to get a replacement bed. Every time I have called I have been told something different. There has been no resolution other than just to wait for the replacement to be processed but they are unable to tell me when that will be, I have never even been offered a refund. I have asked to speak to a manager and been told they will call be back however never did. It has been over a month now since ordering this bed. I am extremely disappointed that they took a substantial amount of money from me and are not even attempting to help at getting a replacement. I have been extremely patient up until this point however am at the end of my tether now.",0,1

Aldi UK,The most disgusting Customer experience I have ever suffered,"I went into Aldi, Bath Road, Reading last Monday. I put my basket of goods down and left it whilst I browsed the store. I returned some time later to find the basket had disappeared. I mentioned this to one of the assistants who was very polite and I then asked to speak to the Manager, as I was bemused as to why my basket would have been taken by a member of staff and the goods returned to the shelves. I was bullied and treated like dirt by the so-called Duty Manager who spoke down to me, undermined me and profiled me. He told me that if I complained about Customer Services nothing would be done about it. I was then ganged up on by another member of staff asking what had happened and when I attempted to explain the situation to her, I was accused of calling her a racist. I had both these individuals shouting in my face, in front of other customers. They were not socially distancing from me and neither of them was wearing a mask. The female member of staff was threatening and aggressive in her attitude and the duty manager was standing over me in an over-bearing manner, insisting that as the store manager was absent, HE was the manager and he was 'IN CHARGE"". They refused to let me buy the goods and said they were refusing to allow me to be served. The duty manager said that he was refusing to serve me and if I attempted to leave the store with the two items that I was holding, he would call the Police. There was no reason for him to say this apart from profiling. The female member of staff confiscated my basket and took it away so that I could not purchase the items. I was told that Customer Services would do nothing about my complaint. I have emailed Aldi Customer Services and they have done nothing about it. I have also emailed the CEO, Mr Hurley. He has not bothered to reply to my email either. It appears that Aldi condones this type of behaviour and the Police are now involved due to the nature of the verbal abuse",0,1
Aldi UK,Poor service,I ordered 2 items from Aldi. Due to the weight I had to pay over £6 for delivery. One item arrived on time. The other never arrived despite receiving an email saying it would be going out for delivery. Over a 2 week period I have had to email Aldi twice and make 3 calls each time waiting in a queue. The last call telling me that the item had been lost by the delivery company. The item is now sold out and to rub salt into the wound I still have had to pay for both items delivery cost even though I only received one. Poor customer service,0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi policy of criminalising customers for cashier errors,"At our local Aldi store, my wife paid for her shopping at the till in the usual way, but as she walked towards the exit, she was stopped by a security guard who demanded to check her shopping against her receipt, ordering her to empty the contents of her bag on the floor. He then allowed her to collect her shopping again and go on her way.Aldi have a policy of encourging cashiers to scan the items as quickly as possible, then search exiting customers' bags with the intent of criminalising the customers for any items that the cashier might have missed scanning properly. Aldi cashiers scan items far too quickly for the customer to check whether every item was scanned properly, as the customer is busy removing items that are filling the tiny removals area with considerable speed.In any case, it is not the customer's responsibility to ensure that every item was scanned. Nor is it realistic for the customer to check the receipt against all bagged items after paying.I do not intend to return to Aldi in view of this dishonest policy, as I can never be sure that the cashier has scanned every item. I am not responsible for any missed scans the cashier might make, and I do not wish to be criminalised for any items the cashier might miss scanning.Nor does my wife wish to be humiliated in public again in our local store.",0,1

The service is fantastic, just wait for a few minutes for them to bring your order out to you, and away you go. I love using this service now, no more trying to get to the goods you're after because there are about 6 people all huddled together by the cheese or chickens, when we should all be social distancing. No more having people nearly push you over while they're stretching in front of you at the yogurts. You can keep it, I am definitely keeping my click and collect service!

Aldi UK,CEO doesnt bother to respond to complaints,"On Sunday the 28th February 2021, Aldi decided to release the stock for their egg chairs and their dual barbecue at the same time. Their systems were overloaded and despite being able to put a barbecue into my basket (and my partners as he was also trying) on multiple occasions from 8.00am, their system kept giving us two messages 503 & 500 and we repeatedly lost the item. I was also being told that my email address was set up on an account and as you couldn't get a password reset (Another system message), I had no choice but to use other email addresses, which I wouldn't normally use as they are old, which caused an added issue of a wrong email address being typed in, on one order. (Later when their system was working - I tried to reset the password for the ""Aldi account"", only to be told that in fact I didn't have an account with them). So after multiple times of losing the barbecue and getting a 500 message, a order finally went through, but as no order number was given on the screen and we were simply pushed back a screen with an empty basket, I didn't realise and I kept trying - after more 500 messages, it was only after I was pushed back a screen, on a second occasion that I got concerned that we may have multiple orders and I checked my bank for a second time. This confirmed that two orders had gone through and Aldi had taken my money twice (£313.88), by 9am. We only received our confirmation email at 5.30pm that night, so until then we had no order numbers or confirmation emails - to actually confirm this. I checked online and found that their customer services didn't open until 10am. During the hour I waited to ring their customer services team, the Barbecue was still showing as having stock and it allowed me to put an item into a basket. At 10.10am, I tried to ring their customer services and spent over 90 minutes in two queues (the first for 60minutes and the second one for 36minutes) before I finally got through to a really friendly customer service person, who told me that, I wasn't the first person to ring in with this problem that morning. She managed to find both orders and a request was sent to cancel one order, as this was on the wrong email address and because I only wanted one item. But I was advised that cancelling my duplicate order, couldn't be guaranteed and that I may end up with two items. Today I have found out that - once Aldi realised that people had multiple orders (because of their system problems), they decided to blanket cancel the duplicate orders yesterday. But they didn't bother to check the status of the original order, so they have now cancelled both my orders and I won't be getting this barbecue, despite being told in an email, that they would only cancel the duplicate and that my original order would still be dispatched.So basically, after an hour of hell, trying to get this item and 90 minutes of getting through to someone to check the orders. Im still out of pocket until the refunds finally reach my bank and I have nothing to show for my trouble. I am not unreasonable and I understand that system issues happen, so while I am unhappy about what has happened, I have no issues with any of the above. What I am REALLY unhappy with - is that despite Aldi advising customers on their website that more stock will be coming in for the barbecue. Plus the fact they didnt check before they cancelled both my orders, they are refusing to reserve a BBC from the stock due in for me as - per their quote this morning - ""stock is given out - on a first come, first served basis"", silly me, because I was on their website at 8am, I had managed to get this barbecue into my basket on more than one occasion (despite losing them on the last page), but still managed to get two orders through the 500 message causing two payments to be deducted from my bank before 9am. They cancelled them both instead of one - so what part of that isn't ""first come - first served basis"" because right now I am really confused. So based on the fact that you have taken my money and let me down badly. I won't be back to order this barbecue or anything else from you - in a nutshell you have lost any goodwill, you had built up with me, over the last year and I won't be back, until you start to look after your customers and sort out issues you have caused.Update : 04.04.21Both refunds were in my account today. I'm still waìting for a reply to my complaint email sent on 02.04.21 to Adam.Zavalis and their CEO Giles.hurleyBoth as their customer service person didn'bother to apologise for their system and human errors. I'm not surprised. Especially as they stopped me putting a review on their website, so they seem to want to stay in the dark to company failures. But Aldi loss is Argos gain, as they are delivering my new barbecue tomorrow. All without system issues, duplicate orders or being messed around.",0,1

This meant dad having to keep stopping along the isle and jump out of her way. Where is Security? I haven't seen any Security person for weeks.

There were so many omissions of key ingredients when I collected that I had to go into the store, to top up. When I got home there were some other fruit items I.e mangoes that were damaged. You then speak to customer services explain the situation and they then revert you back to the store to see a store manager. I don’t want to go into a store and speak to a store manager during a pandemic. I then tweet Aldi to explain my customer service response, after some exchanges they advise that I go back to my store and speak to the manager and that they can’t help. You couldn’t make it up.

Cut to 2 weeks later - after several calls with Aldi I now have half a bed and the other half is somewhere in their warehouse or somewhere else, nobody seems to know?! But they're now telling me I'll need to return the part of the bed I have as they won't be able to send out the part that was returned by the couriers. Needless to say there is zero logic behind their customer service and due to the bed now being out of stock I can't order another but can't keep the one I already have half of either! Ridiculous.

Their most expensive steak was at least a third fat. I rang and was told to take them back, a 20 mile round trip for me and then into the shop that I have been avoiding for the best part of the year. I was offered a £10 gift voucher, the steak alone was £7.45!! I emailed customer service with photos and had a dismissive reply. No online refund set up yet. Clearly not ready for click and collect and the service cost me £4.99. What a disgrace!!",0,1

Aldi UK,dodgy scanning,"Went to my local Aldi to buy sweets for my 2 year old. Selected 4 or 5 different sweets then my daughter had a meltdown at the till. I paid as quickly as I could using contactless and left the store. It wasn't until I got home I looked at the receipt and realised I'd been charged an extra 2.99 for an oven dish !. I think I would have noticed buying an oven dish. How can this happen ?. Check your receipts, there's something dodgy going on at aldi.",0,1

Aldi UK,Avoid the Ashton under Lyne Store,Used Aldi up and down the country and had some good bad experiences but without question the store in Ashton under Lyne is atrocious.

Aldi customer service make it nearly impossible to make them aware of this issue with this store. Makes you want to delete the whole chain from list of retailers. AVOID Ashton Store.,0,1
Aldi UK,Don’t bother,"Don’t bother. Popped into the Leicester Aylestone road branch. Wanted two bottles of champagne so me and my friends went in. We are all over 30. Was asked for ID at the till which was no problem but my friend who was 32 didn’t have hers. The woman at check out 1 refused to serve us. By this logic then, a mother in the presence of her child cannot buy alcohol because the child is underage. Anyway we left and went to the bargain booze across the road. My other friend who was waiting in the car went into Aldi to get some cider. When he got to the checkout ( a different one) the women from till 1 came running over shouting “do not serve him” despite producing his ID. The women said she saw us talking outside and that we shouldn’t be served. An argument arose, the new till operator served my friend and we left. I do not know what this women’s problem was but it was clear that it had something to do with our race. Her attitude was disgusting. Why she felt the need to police us is beyond me. I come to Aldi everyday. Not no more.",0,1

Aldi UK,Disappointing experience,"We were surprised to find Aldi doe a wine delivery service so we purchased our 6 bottles and paid for next day delivery. They turned up the next day but all 6 bottles were incorrect, we ordered white wine and we received red. The 4th customer service guy was great, (after being cut off 3 times by other agents) and arranged for a collection. He advised to call when the order had been collected and we'd have a new order resent on next day, Sure enough, the courier came and collected, we called to advise and the agent resent the order, but refused to give us next day even though we'd paid for it and were told our delivery would be another 5 days. So we cancelled for a full refund. Very disorganised and we wouldn't order online with them again.",0,1

They insulted me after several months back and to with them by offering £30 as a gesture of good will (that can only be redeemed online with them might I add) which doesn't even cover a tenth of the cost of the BBQ which I now have to replace after only using it once.

Two days later received an email advising three of the wines were out of stock and they were sending me only three. Why allow you to select them when they are not in stock? Why not give you the option to cancel the whole order rather than send only part of it? I would have gone elsewhere. This is twice I have ordered a crate of six only to receive half the order.

Aldi UK,Always terrible customer service,"Whilst I will continue to shop with Aldi purely due to their prices on certain goods, I have NEVER had a good experience with customer service at my local Aldi. Either the server is downright rude, doesn't even acknowledge you except in telling you your total cost or more often than not are laughing or joking with other team members whilst they serve you and again totally ignoring you. I completely understand that team members have to stay at a certain speed and meet certain kpi's etc, but you can be polite to your customers whilst doing that. Doesn't need to be chit chat, just a friendly hello. I had a particularly awful experience today where you could tell the lady, Anna, was scowling under her mask. I was packing my bags maybe a little slower than she was scanning and she was aggressively pushing my shipping towards me. When I moved the EFTPOS machine, which is on a movable arm so you can access it better towards me, as it was not really accessible from its position, as soon as I had moved my card away she slammed it back into the position it was originally in, despite it not even obscuring her work space. She then proceeded to start scanning the next persons shopping before I even had a chance to move away from the counter. I don't need chitchat from staff but Aldi team members could certainly use a lesson in politeness.",0,2

Aldi UK,Short dates from click and collect and car park dangerous,"I love the quality of Aldi food but yesterdays click and collect experience has now turned me against click and collect.. 12 of my items had such short dates that i would have to use it all within 2 days.. Also the car park was still covered in snow and thick ice that the click and collect area was impossible for staff to safely bring shopping over to us.. We had to move car down near store entrace.. We asked staff why car park had not been gritted and her answer was,, """" Aldi dont own the car park """". OMG as long as Aldi get your money they dont care if you fall over on ice in the car park "". Disgusting attitude... So i paid £4.99 for click and collect for aldi staff off load thier crappy short dated food and for the car park to be dangerous and staff to shrug matter off even though she herself had problems walking safely.. I know Aldi is a no frills shop but where was health and safety and risk assessment from management.. Put customers at risk to save a few poinds on couple of bags of grit.... All in all bad service yesterday from a shop that i have previously enjoyed shopping at.. Customer services judt agree with everything you day and give you a reference number ????",0,1

Im 31 weeks pregnant and I was concerned for my health as the store was over crowded with people to the point people was barging others to get past. I asked one of the store workers who said her name was keeley why there was so many people being allowed into the store and her response was because people don’t follow rules!! In response to that I asked why is there no one outside the shop to manage this she shrugged her shoulders and stated it was not the stores job to manage and my complaint was invalid as my mask was loose? At least my mask was actually on!! It was covering both mouth and nose wether or not it looked too big was non of her concern! She asked me to tighten a surgical mask before I started complaining about how many people was in the store!! I asked her to get her manager and with attitude she fetched him but stated he will only say the same as herself. Her manager Tom said the reason why no one was at the door was because they was sick of taking abuse by customers. And therefore they are allowing the public to come in as they please. Never again will I shop at Aldi I left my trolly full of shopping and left the store crying.,0,1

Aldi UK,I work for the NHS as a Responder and…,"I work for the NHS as a Responder and one of my duties is to shop for people who are vulnerable and housebound or who have just come out of hospital. I need to make a very serious complaint about your Manager, Charlie, at the Bulwell branch Sellers Wood DriveBulwell, NottinghamNG6 8GEI visited that store at 16:40 today to do a shop for a vulnerable person in Bulwell and I asked a member of staff where tiger bread is (not knowing at the time that he was the store manager) I was interrupted by a black woman who was not wearing a mask nor was showing any exemption lanyard who interrupted my conversation with Charlie I told her I was talking to him and she told me to 'f**' off' she was only about 2 feet from me. I challenged her why she was not wearing a mask and told me again to 'f*** off' Charlie made no attempts to calm things down and said nothing and did challenging her her about not wearing a mask. She continued the confrontation in the bread aisle just telling me whats it got to do with me and I explained that everyone needs to wear a mask and she was not exempt either then told me again to 'f*** off you stupid c***' even another shopper walking past saying face masks make no difference. When I challenged your store manager, Charlie, who walked past me and I said thank you for your support why did your not challenger her, and he just said not interested and nothing to do with me but was incredibly rude indeed so I said you are very rude for a manager and then had the AUDACITY to tell me to leave the store..! That's what he should have said to that black woman. I told him too who that I was a NHS responder and I was wearing my high viz jacket starting my role for the NHS, latex gloves and mask and fase shield. And that I was doing some shopping for a disabled person who was isolating and was not interested at all and told me to leave. He was incredibly rude and had a very bad attitude and disrespect, and manners. You have a tannoy going informing people to keep 2 metres assist which no one was doing and you must wear a mask. Here is an extract from your website, see picture attached. So why was this lady not rejected by Charlie you sure manager? Who is meant to be monitoring the legal requirements of face coverings in your store if Charlie the manager is not prepared to challenge those without a mask?It was a very upsetting experience especially made worse that I was shopping as a NHS Responder to help someone out where I had to travel 10 miles to get to him. The disabled gentleman requested I go to this branch. I do hope you will take action with 'Charlie' as he clearly needs extras customer service skills. It was disgraceful and very embarrassing. I will think twice about going to aldi again even for myself. I will be paying this on your twitter account and Facebook page if you have one and on trust pilot. I will also be contacting the newspaper as this is not the sort of treatment an NHS person should be treated. Charlie needs to take this pandemic seriously. If your are on the front line seeing very ill covid patients and seeing deaf bodies being wheeled out you would understand. RegardsDavid Williams",0,1
Aldi UK,Very poor click & collect service.,"Booked and paid for a click & collect order a few days ago for collection today 13/02/21 between 09:00 - 10:00.amFrom the ALDI. Silverwoods way, Kidderminster.Had a phone message from the store at 08:40 stating that there had been an IT problem, and they had over booked the time slot, and would not be able to provide my order. Also customer services should be in contact with me within a few days.I contacted customer services right away, (twice) after the 1st call being on hold timed out and hung up.I asked what is happening to my order, and the one hundred and twenty pounds that had paid for my order.CS: stated that there had been a problem with the stores booking system and over booked 29 orders for the time slot, so had cancelled all of them. I asked could they re-book a slot for me asap, but said they could not do that for me from their system.I stated that I was in a shielding group so I normally don't go into stores, and they also have my money for the groceries that they haven't supplied. What should I do? they offered no suggestions of help except for there may be a Deliveroo service operating with limited stock. Again I assume I would have to book this myself, I did say that they do not operate in my area as we are 10 miles out of town so no service. and my guess is that other orders would have to be paid for again, and wait for the original order refund (Great Service).CS stated that it will take several days to get the funds repaid into the bank account. so I have now no groceries and no money.I have used this click & collect since day one all normally ok. but it seems that when there is a problem you get no help in resolving the issue, and all the emphasis is put on YOU to solve your own problems caused by them (ALDI).Just another company that just wants your money and not prepared to go out of their way to help anyone.I will be avoiding ALDI in the future and trying out their competition from now on.

The package finally arrived on 3rd February in a badly damaged box and not surprisingly component parts were missing.After complaining to Aldi customer services I was told to return the package and that a refund would be made when the easel was received by them.

Waited until my next Click & Collect on 06/02/21, received a refund but then discovered this new order had 3 missing items which i was charged for, & a small tin of pineapple was supplied instead of large. They charged me for a large tin. What is the point of paying £4.99 to have an order picked when they make mistakes like this?

Aldi UK,Aldi Click & Collect - Nightmare at Chatteris,"Aldi Click & Collect - Chatteris CambsPurchased Aldi Click & Collect shopping on Sunday 7th Feb 2021. Absolute nightmare: The shopping was brought out to us which we loaded into our car. Fortunately before we drove off we checked in some of the bags as some items we thought we had not ordered. On closer inspection found we had several extra items to our order but we were missing several as well and the items did not match our order confirmation. Had to go into the store and find a assistant, the person who picked the order came out, indignantly told us she did inform us about the substitutions, but the extra & missing items were not substitutions. After she had investigated and we had waited 40 mins in the car park, it appeared we had part of our order and part of someone else's order and the other customer had part of ours, we were given our missing items and the extra items were taken back. When we eventually arrived home, we checked off all the shopping and found we were three items missing for which we had been charged. But Aldi would not refund the missing items online, we would have to return to the store and process the refund in store, defeating the objective of click & collect in avoiding store entry. If Aldi can take payment online why can't they refund? They did not go out of their way to put right their error, instead caused more problems.

Must have been doing his good deed for the day!Then he walks to a colleague and I hear him refer to customers as ""flipping weirdos!""Young staff, chatting away like they're at a social gathering. No hellos or goodbyes. No wonder they're advertising for a store manager coz who ever is there now needs to sort his/her staff out!Security guys are lovely! Aldi, this store needs to be checked in on, staffing attitudes need to be addressed and it might be worth explaining that rolling cigarettes in your till isn't a very positive way to represent your stores. Bearwood High Street Aldi however are fantastic! Maybe some in house training might be needed !",0,2
Aldi UK,Aldi Click and Collect,"I have recently started using the new Aldi click and collect service. I can not rate this service highly enough. I have used this service for 3 shops now, 1 £35 small shop and 2 over £70 shops. My experience has being outstanding! The website did take some getting used to but the more u use it the easier it gets. Staff who bring your shopping to the car, who arrived within 3 minutes of your arrival, have always been polite and helpful with putting the shopping in the car. Very few things were substituted or unavailable and the things that were substituted were perfectly suitable swaps. All unavailable or swapped items are emailed to you prior to collection so u can decline the items when your shopping is bought out. Well done Aldi. I will certainly recommend you. 😊",0,5
Aldi UK,"Great value, Expect a workout at the checkout.","Great value, with a great range, especially if you have a taste for European Quisine. The Ales sport a range of top choices at the BEST prices. I find that trolley at Aldi can cost around £100 less than Tescos, so worth a trip! A lot of ""store brand"" products that are actually the same as the expensive brands (Hula Hoops and Aldi Hoops are one in the same crisp from the same factory), so worth shopping away from the names you know.You WILL get a work out like a slave rowing boat at the checkout, but that is how the business model works, faster check outs means less staff, which means cheaper shopping. Don't like that? Go to Tescos, and pay more for a sedentry check out service, simple.Staff are friendly, and work like Spartans, so give them the respect they deserve.",0,5
Aldi UK,Bad foods Expiring Date etc,"Hi, I would like to review this site again. Since being 10 years in the UK I would say that Aldi isn't the best market I prefer to go to buy foods, the least if my parents are lazy don't feel like going to other markets all the way to town to Lidl or Tesco, Morrison's to go to groceries store.Most of the foods have very short limited expiring dates and it's not even good to make a mega shopping to fill the fridge at home or in the cupboard. My dad complained how the money got wasted for a short period of time because most foods are expired, mostly breads and salads and milks too. So if you wanna buy foods get smaller quantity you're sure you can finish it.If you want a long lasting foods to keep for long I advice Lidl or Tesco. So far am Italian and to be honest the supermarket In's is better than Aldi and other Italian markets. Not trying to downgrade it but I seldom go to aldi to buy anything. The last time I got to Aldi was last month since almost a year I haven't stepped in because when you get inside there's nothing good you wanna buy.The best market so far is Lidl and Tesco, Morrisons I don't know I haven't been there for a long time so gotta go there but Aldi needs to sort out with expiring dates foods. My favourite mozzarella I ate in Aldi is disgusting and doesn't even seemed they did it well. So am sorry I don't think am going to buy foods in Aldi again unless my parents go there when they're lazy. I keep telling them to stop going to Aldi but refuses but then they complain when none of us eat it lol. So I give it to 1 star.",0,1
Aldi UK,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed. I will never order online again from Aldi! Having tried unsussefully five times to return an item to them I finally had to contact the courier myself and place a negative review on line before they collected it. So after two months waiting, five days wasted waiting in for collection, God knows how many wasted calls/minutes on phone to customer service 2 emails 2 unreturned requests for mangers call back. They offered me a good will gesture of £10! How valued my wasted time is. I told the girl to tell her manager to donate it to cancer research, if they had any decency they would double it and donate it to cancer research on my behalf. Yes I have told them this via email, bet they don't even bother.",0,1
Aldi UK,2 bad experiences,"2 bad experiences. Click and collect - lost order & when order found, mouldy and close to sell-by-date produce. Too hard to check everything in the dark in service bay. Customer ‘service’ not interested, told me to go into store, which kinda defeats the object of ‘click & collect’ .. !2nd experience, ordered wine online as an anniversary gift. It ‘went missing’ so got caught between Aldi & Yodel - spent hours between the two companies trying to get my money back. Fobbed off by customer service who gave conflicting information. Told me it would get replaced on time for anniversary, never did, Promised ‘call back’ never happened. This company do not care about negative reviews (they do not respond on here) because it has no financial impact on them. They really couldn’t give a fig about their customers. Had much better customer service with Lidl.",0,1
Aldi UK,Accused of shoplifting,"I had an extremely embarrassing and humiliating experience whilst shopping at Aldi Crawley where I was accused of shoplifting. Not only had I paid and had evidence to back it up with receipt I feel that the whole way I was treated fell far short of how customers should be treated. For a lone female to be surrounded by 6 male members of staff out in a car park at night not one of them followed me as a black woman with any thought they might be wrong. Totally disproportionate treatment and the apology I got from the men was "" well some people steal"". Shameful. Disappointed that Rosie ( if that was her real name) suddenly had a memory loss as to who came out and followed me. Would not give me her full name and then would not get me some paper as I was going to get details of individuals involved. I will never shop there again. This is the reason people like me have to make sure we get a receipt. Poor showing Aldi.",0,1
Aldi UK,Madeley store Telford,We went in to the madeley store telford as a couple. Were both key workers and have to do our shopping together. A member off staff saw us walk in and didnt say anything. Walked straight passed her. Been in there doing our shopping and a member of staff comes over and asks if were together. When we explained we was together he escorted my husband out like he was a criminal even though he was leaving the store anyway as asked! Theres one thing being asked to leave politely and theres one thing being escorted out like youve stole something.Also the store was full of couples! So why were we the only ones asked to leave!

Aldi UK,I bought a twin pack of steak last…,I bought a twin pack of steak last Saturday. It looked great. When I opened it and turned it over one piece was half covered in disgusting white fat. I took a photo and the next Saturday showed James the assistant manager in Leigh Aldi. He said I should of brought it back. I told him it was opened and I wasn't keeping Rae meat for a week. He just shrugged like he couldn't give a toss and said ring Aldi. I was so embarrassed as he made me feel like I was lying. I spend over £40 per week most weeks. After this I shall take my money elsewhere that the staff actually have some customer care. Jane.,0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi promises a lot but doesn't deliver,Not sure how Aldi has managed to create such hype around itself the reality is it's online ordering delivery and customer service are very poor. They still offer a next day delivery service which they charge for yet days later the item hasn't been despatched and the only way you can contact them is by phone which means a long wait in a queue.,0,1
Aldi UK,Tearful Click and collect experience,"With tears I tell you that my click and collect experience was not good. They over-charged me and got basic groceries wrong.

This was two weeks ago I have nothing refunded to me. I was crying. I love Aldi but will never allow them to shop for me again. I feel robbed.",0,1

Aldi UK,I won’t ever be placing an order with them again,"I placed an order a week ago. 4 days passed and my order was still at the status of processing. One of the items I ordered was now on day 4 showing as out of stock. So I decided to ring Aldi customer services as your only options are to phone them or write in. No email options available. The lady I spoke with was very nice and reassured me there were no problems with my order and it was obviously taking them longer to dispatch the items, that’s why it was still showing as processing. Another day goes by. Another item now out of stock. 2 more days pass and I receive three emails in quick succession from Aldi, 1 advising dispatch of 1 item. 2 more advising my other 2 items were no out of stock and that I would be being refunded. So thanks Aldi. It’s fantastic placing an item with yourselves, seeing everyday your ‘selling fast 70+ sold today’ rubbish and knowing that you’re quite happy processing new orders until stock is sold out whist ignoring my order for a week before telling me that you’ve now sold out of the product that was in stock for 4 days after I ordered it. Those were birthday presents for my sons. So thank you so much. I will never be using you again. And what’s more I have been advising friends, family, and work colleagues to never order off you online as you are incapable of honouring your orders. Absolutely poor service.",0,1

Aldi UK,Poor Couriers and i am out of pocket!,"Poor Couriers and i am out of pocket!I ordered a TV special buy for a new house move, unfortunately this fell through so i just put it in storage with the rest of my belongings as i have been living out of boxes for almost a year in my childhood bedroom at my parents house. Everything finally goes right and i open the TV only to find it is damaged. A brand new TV that was delivered damaged! I immediately contacted the warranty to get resolved and they advised they can't help so then i try Aldi. The first person i spoke to Abigail, could not have been more sympathetic and tried her best to help. She passed my case to warranty and i was told i would get a call back 48hrs later. Well 4 days later nothing so i chase them to be told they are running behind - looking at the below reviews i can see why! I get through to Aiden who was so patronising and would not let me speak. I got so frustrated that i eventually said get me a manager to which he refused and just kept talking over me and was simply rude. Eventually when i could get a word in, he said a manager would call me the next day. Well that didn;t happen but i did get a call today, they reiterated their own stance that they couldn't/wouldn't help and my issue is with warranty. I stated i have already contacted them and they are refusing to help and told me to speak to Aldi so she said forward this correspondance so i did. Phone call back on this, still my issue is with warranty so have to continue to take it up with them.So....Managing Director has now been contacted, as well as Which? as this is appalling service and i am now out of pocket over £300 for something they delivered faulty! I claimed my rights as a consumer that according to the Sales of Goods Act i have a right to claim Fualty at First Use Clause but they were not having any of it. They just kept going on about Aldi's rights and gave no regards for mine. I am so disappointed as i have been a long standing client of Aldi's but no longer if this is how they wish to treat their customers.",0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi on a mission to lose customers,"Aldi, stop treating your customers like uneducated fools and with a little more respect. Entered store with husband in Nottingham and was jumped on by a member of staff who insisted on giving us the third degree as to why we were shopping as a couple. Firstly, the store was deadly quiet so wouldn't be causing a problem regarding safe distancing and secondly we were shopping not only for our family but for a family who are shielding. We offered to get a second trolley and whilst my husband did this, the said member of staff continued to follow me down the aisle constantly harping on and on about why I needed him with me and that I was being awkward. Well, firstly it's not right you standing so close to me spitting your venom without a mask so you're more of the problem not me and secondly I have a medical condition which I personally believe I don't need to share with the whole of Aldi. You can see what was coming a mile off when the member of staff wasn't getting their own way and continued on their mission of preaching about pandemics (yes, I know we are in a pandemic, I was wearing a mask!) when they asked us to leave. Well Aldi, get your signs right as it clearly stated 1 per trolley where ever possible and I for one will never step foot in your stores again. Looking at your current reviews I think it's about time you stop being so complacent and leaving people in charge who clearly need to work on their people's skills!

He went and got the manager who told us we were fine without the exempt card (that anyone who is anyone can buy off Amazon) when we got to the tills we were questioned again, why no mask, what makes you exempt? So I told her. I don’t appreciate being harassed by staff while shopping with my children.

They have promised a manager would call 3 times but they don't ring and another promised a gesture of goodwill but that hasn't materialised either. Full of false promises.

Aldi UK,"Shoddy, broken gaming PC upon arrival + no full refund (£450 out of pocket)","We purchased a gaming computer in the Black Friday sales last year as a main Christmas gift for our children, to only find that the computer would not turn on, on Xmas day. We attempted to return it to our local store, and we were informed that due to it being an ""online purchase"" it needed to be returned by calling your customer service team.We did this, and the courier did not turn up to collect the computer on the day that was agreed for the collection. So we had to call your call centre again to arrange another collection (which did arrive and took the computer away).I contacted the ALDI call centre again this Monday to ask when the money would be returned to my account, as the collection was made on Friday 15th Jan, and the money had still not been returned. The call centre advisor (Serena) informed us that the computer has not been collected and an investigated would need to be raised by Aldi with the courier, and Serena would get back to me in the next 24-48 hours. I asked her to contact me by phone and email, to cover both bases. It's now 48 hours later, and I have still not yet received a response???I have emailed the ALDI customer service team a few times in this whole disaster of a process, and received a automatic replies stating someone would contact us within 7 days, and yet we have still not had any responses to date. Our children has been without their main Xmas gift for this whole period, which has left them very disappointed. We added a negative review about the product on the ALDI w/s, and their response was I should take the computer in-store for a refund. Although that was the first thing I tried, and I was told that they were unable to accept the return and provide a refund as it was an online purchase....so all in all pretty shoddy products and thee worst customer service.And we're £450 out of pocket, and have 4 very disappointed children, as we need the refund to be able tp purchase them an alternative computer from a different outlet. We've totally lost our patience now, as we're 2 months on, and we don't have a working gaming pc or a full refund. We will NOT purchase from ALDI again, and will do NOT recommend that anyone buys any expensive computers from ALDI (as they simply do not work).

Yet again I didn’t check but at home I spot box is liking so I opened and I have to throw half box of these cans well on the end i bin them all as bottom of box was covered with mould. I post that on Facebook where people put so much hate on me , but is it that normal? I understand is cheap there and quality of food are not very good that why I’m only went there 2 times as it was on my way . It is cheap but I still pay . I pay full price for rolls , full price for cans and just throw to bin . Basically i bin my money. I will never go there again. Thankfully no all there people are haters and common and some of my friends after seen the pictures said they will not go there as well and forward post to others and swap to other shops.",0,1
Aldi UK,First class service,Just thought i would share my experience of my shopping trip to your Loughton store on Saturday 23rd January.When I got into the store there was a lady called Marion stocking up the fruit and veg she was very happy with what she was doing and we shared a joke and then said if there was something I couldn’t find I was to let her know and she would help. When I finished my shopping I got to the checkoutI saw a lady called Pam who is a regular staff member and always has a smile for all the customers. I have never had a bad experience at this store and even in this strange time all your staff have a smile on their faces and are always polite.,0,5
Aldi UK,My visit to Aldi left me feeling vulnerable and unsafe.,"I am a fan of Aldi it is my supermarket of choice. On Friday 22/January at 16:20 I visited my local branch in Shettleston Glasgow where I found that there was no hand sanitiser available, the shop was overcrowded with several people not wearing masks. The store was so full I felt exposed and unsafe. I was also very aware that there were no members of staff on the floor to discuss this as every till was open with the security guard who should have perhaps been monitoring the flow of customers entering the store was in fact having to direct the queues waiting at the tills. I did manage to speak to the store manager and while he was courteous and agreed that the situation was not ideal he suggested that for staff to remind customers of the requirement to wear a mask was difficult as some customers could be be abusive when challenged. My overall experience on that day was of a store that was drastically under staffed with no attempt at controlling the amount of people entering the store. I fail to understand why during the first lockdown a member of stall would be on the door counting people in and out and this seems to have been replaced by a traffic light system that is clearly being ignored by some customers.",0,1
Aldi UK,"Quick whinge. Hope to delete shortly, if Aldi will 'deal.'","UPDATE: Not a word to the following from Aldi so far. Sad about that.. further.. (posted 260421).. and almost 3 months on from original posting at end Jan 2021, still not a word from Aldi. Odd because they would have been notified of it via the reviewer options, my having completed the original posting. Therefore, decision made; this review will stand.**** My previous review of Aldi is 5 stars ~ this is a quick whinge as a regular and otherwise enthusiastic customer of towards 10 years. I would respectfully invite Aldi to read my other for the context it will give.The Prosecco!Not the deceptively similarly labelled 'nearly prossecco' versions, of which I think there are now two. As an aside, I do think this ambiguous, highly misleading 'mirror-labelling' should be changed, by the way .. they all look the same! I have seen customers pick up similarly labelled bottles and on the one occasion, I bravely decided to poke my nosey nose in to ask if they were actually after the Prosecco Proper! They were indeed! Their passing comment was that they thought the one they had a week or so previously had tasted.. 'a bit naff.'.. So, they wanted not at all the 'Frizzante' in the trolley (It's surely Italian for 'flat but in any event lacking in any sparkle or character'?)How grateful were they! It took me some time to readjust my halo. I really am seriously understated as a modern day Spiderman superhero. The mask but not the lycra. (Aldi does have certain store entry requirements.) Nope, this whinger refers to the ACTUAL ""Prosecco Extra Dry..."" the REAL one.. typically at £5.99 - was very generously reduced to £4.99 over Christmas and towards mid January which was Aldi at its typical, 'non-greedy' best. Credit where it is due. Yes, THAT version! OK., we got there. (Ronnie Corbett wrote this all for me from his armchair.) Insistently difficult to open the blo*dy things. The neck of the cork is often cut so that it is excessively tapered/angled towards the neck of the bottle, making it ultimately painful on the hand to remove, after the increasingly necessary multiple attempts. It seems to be about 75% of the bottles we get through. One has to stop, take a breather and have another go. This is exactly what I am doing as I type this beautiful diatribe.Te*co Finest....? Never a problem since the cork has a more intelligent, consistent, 'near vertically cut' shape.Problem. I dislike Tesco. Intensely. But, sadly, will not be buying anymore Prosecco from Aldi from now - 23rd Jan - unless and until they get the supplier to redesign their corks. Will have to give Morris*ns a go since it's nearby. (Dislike Tesco intensely. Sorry. Did I say that already? Don't make me go back there, Mr Aldi! I despise their historical, cynical greedy business model.) Oh, don't get me started! I don't get out much. The authorities won't allow it. My household guzzles about 24 odd bottles per month since the covid saga. Just short of 1 a day. (And so, with the four small apples, that makes 5 a day.) Again, credit where it's due: thanks, China! Have been at the latest bottle just now - in three separate attempts because it quickly hurts the hand with the sheer effort of it as intimated - and no luck so far. Its half out and there it remains. Like a turtle head mocking the alcoholic. The Cork has elastic flex which doesn't help. Look into this, please. And stop laughing. It's highly irritating.P. S. Just opened the damned thing. 4th attempt and much swearing. Chr*st, do I need a drink!",0,2
Aldi UK,On behalf of my sister So yesterday I…,"On behalf of my sister So yesterday I was in aldi dagenham where apart from other shopping I needed a packet of nappies for my granddaughter , when I got to the nappy isle there was a man and woman filling 2 large trollies with every single pack of nappies of every single size and taking all the wipes aswell .I challenged them saying I need a pack of nappies , when the lady became rude and aggressive towards me so I asked a member of staff if this was allowed and his answer was probably not , but then went on his way .When I got to the till the couple were arguing with the till operator about the amount they had ( in excess of 50 nappies in every size , and in excess of 40 packs of wipes ) , I commented to the man serving me that I wanted just 1 pack but they had cleared the shelves ,to which then the husband turned to me and said "" its people like u that give WHITE people a bad name ! I confronted him saying he was being racist ( he's black and I'm white ) and asked why he was saying that but he continued to mutter about me being white so I asked staff to call the police but none of the staff would help , as if things couldn't get worse his wife then said "" what you need is a big black c##k up you!! Another customer came to my assistance and said how disgusting they both were and the wife then repeated herself to the customer all this time I was begging for staff to call the police ..but they wouldn't dispite now at least 4 other customers asking too .The couple were allowed to just leave the shop along with majority of the nappies and wipes in their trollies. When I got home I rang Aldi head office and was told someone would be in touch. Well today someone from customer service called and I was basically told that as none of ""their staff "" had been assaulted or insulted or attacked , then thats why they wouldn't phone the police .so I glad to now know that as long as your staff are safe then you don't care one bit about your customers ! Nice attitude to have",0,1

Aldi UK,"Don't buy anything online if you thikn you may consider returning, terrible customer service",Don't buy anything online that you may consider returning! I returned a few items from an online order to Aldi just before Christmas. They were received in their warehouse on 2 January but twenty days later I have not yet received a refund or an acknowledgement that the goods were received. I contacted Aldi about 10 days after the items were delviered back to their warehouse but was rudely brushed off by their customer service representative Alanna who stated that I must wait for full 14 working days following the receipt of the goods by Aldi in order to prompt an investigation! I followed up again after the 14 working days had exprired but received no respose. If I could rate their customer service zero I would! Will not purchase anything from Aldi online again.,0,1
Aldi UK,Follow up visit (Thurs 21/1/21),"Yesterday (Thurs 21/1/21) I did a follow-up to my “denied service” visit a week ago at the Dagenham Aldi store. I am pleased to report that I had no issues. “Obi”, the security guard, welcomed me with a friendly “thumbs up” and said all was now clear. (No more mention of exemption cards and he was even wearing an identification arm band.) He seems like a nice guy... polite and courteous... as he was on the first occasion. I do not know whether I should thank Aldi HQ or TrustPilot – or maybe, both.Did Aldi HQ do what they promised; that is, call the branch? Perhaps they did have “a quiet word in the managers ear-hole and gave him a long distance wagging finger, saying, a tut-tut, naughty, naughty boy! Behave, or it will be the naughty step for you!”Or was it TrustPilot for giving ordinary people the platform to complain? Maybe, large companies really do care about their image and read poor reviews and have the genuine desire to improve.Either way, well done Aldi HQ for listening to this customer’s feedback and favourably resolving the issue.I rarely complain as... well, I guess as most people believe... it’s a waste of time and nothing will ever be done! In this case, I am happy to say I was wrong.I’m hoping my complaint and the resolution has done some good for a few fellow shoppers.One hears and reads from senior and vulnerable people being just too terrified to leave their home to go shopping. One reason is that they don’t want to be challenged by the unidentifiable, visually scary “men in black” at many store entrances and they also fear intimidation from fellow customers for their “hidden disability”.I’ve given Aldi four stars on this post – where I’ve always considered the rating should be; which is based my many years of shopping in the stores around London, Manchester and North Wales.I’ve never had issues before this “Dagenham Manager” incident and so I am puzzled by the over 60% bad reviews on TrustPilot.Once again, thank you Aldi for listening and correcting; so making the Dagenham Branch a more friendly and welcoming place to shop.",0,4

Took me collectively 3 hours to contact customer services, admittedly in between working from home and home schooling. When I finally did get through I was apologised to 3 times and that was it but told to drive back to the shop and sort it out. If that is the solution, why not publish the actual store number so you can speak with them yourself to resolve the matter?!

Aldi UK,"GREAT STORE, SHAME ABOUT THEIR HEAD OFFICE ADMIN","I would like to give 5 stars to the staff and management of the relatively new Aldi in Hythe, Kent for a well run store, but particularly their application of the Click and Collect service. I have used it three times and the service has been well organised, and have been assisted by employee Sunny who has been very helpful in assisting me with collection. However, no stars at all to Aldi's dismal service from their Head Office. Last weekend the Click and Collection software developed a fault which meant customers could not amend or add to their shopping list a couple of days before collection. I phoned their customer service to explain the problem of which they seemed vaguely aware, and Harry there asked me to stay on hold while he investigated; after about 3 minutes I was cut off, I phoned later - all lines busy and was invited to leave my number for a call back, which,of course, didn't happen.I therefore emailed customer service, explained the problem, and asked them to forward my email to the Hythe store which gave a list of what I wanted added. I collected the order today, but the store, although aware of the software problem, knew nothing of the email or my requested additions.I had emailed Aldi customer service 3 weeks ago on another matter with some compliments about their Hythe store, but with a query involving pricing, Apart from an automated response, I have had no reply at all.",0,3

I walked around the isles and came to the same spot to pick something there. This foreign woman then approached me to my dismay. I couldn’t understand her but got the vibe that she must have been related to the man which had just come near me. I had managed to distance myself from her and looked at the security guard. The security guard then said “you ladies should take this outside”.I really didn’t want to talk with anyone in this store as I didn’t want to expose myself to corona and took the option to tell this woman where to go. I used the F off and walked off.

Aldi UK,Bad store management.,"Today I was to aldi Wellington, Telford. You can go there inside just one person per trolley, this mean you need to have a trolley and your wife/partener need to have another trolley ( s..t idea). I asked from where they had this stupid idea, any other store do not have something like this, anyway is aldi''s policy ... After this we gone inside with a trolley and my wife with a basket. We saw two aldi members of staff that they did not wear masks and because they said at entrance they care abaut customers helth, each person to use one teolley 🤣🤣🤣, I asked them why one of them not wearing a mask. One said he has asthma. ok he can weare face shield! I think if they realy want taught rules in tier 4, instead to push inside the store more trolleys they need to respect restrictions and to weare masks or face shields. Even a guy with asthma can spread or to be infected with covid 19. Or mybe, the guys with asthma need to stay at home with this restriction, tier 4! They can came back to work on tier 2 ( I think). I took a picture of them and after this I was ask to leave the store. On my way to exit I asked to speak to the manager. In front of the tills and packing area, between customers, was another ginger guy aldi employee with the same problem, asthma and no face shield or mask ( do not have his picture). This mean two aldi employee, on the same day, on the same shift was unprotected and broked the covid 19 restrictions, and the only answer was that they have asthma. The lady manager said if I have something to comply I need to do it online. Ok I will do it! I need to mention: me and my wife wore the masks all the time on nose and chin.

Aldi UK,Aldi click and collect - USELESS ONLINE,Tried using Aldi click and collect several times now as my local store offer this service and everytime been into Chatham store there is no COVID social distancing either by public or staff. Click and collect keeps saying problem with my password and everytime I ask for reset I get nothing. Even sent customer query in about it in December and no replied received. If this is a new service to make them as competitive as other supermarkets offering collection then you are having a poor stab at it. I've now had to go to your competitors again just to use a click and collect online service that works!!,0,1
Aldi UK,Bought a kettle from Aldi store,Bought a kettle from Aldi store 7 months later the lid didn’t pop up so as requested by Aldi I had to send it to an address they gave me with the original receipt and warranty card and reason for return that was November 2019 we are now in January 2021 I kept my proof of postage several phone calls and emails I still haven’t got my refund of £25 they say they haven’t any record of my information all their products so they say come with a 3 year warranty which I don’t believe I think it’s unacceptable the way I have been treated I just want my money back not too much to ask is it ??,0,1

Aldi UK,Checkouts and stock staff,"My partner and I have been shopping at Aldi, Fulwood since it more or less first opened and we do love the produce however, since before the third national lockdown, there has been an increasing annoyance that today pushed the boundaries of customer service for me in this or any other supermarket. I would like to mention before continuing that communication is always key to any good business. Today I visited the store as usual and on approaching checkout was met with the almost constant shouting out between checkout staff over pricing, bar codes, tills opening/ closing. I don't ever remember it being so vocal previously and certainly not that LOUD. I do understand that staff need to speak with each other if there is something amiss, but this was absolutely ridiculous. Note to Management, just an idea - GET SOME INTERCOMS INSTALLED? It made the shopping experience for me more stressful in these already anxiety ridden times and did put me off to be quite honest. Has customer service gone by the wayside for Aldi since Covid 19? I feel its just gotten worse and worse and nobody seems to be taking any of this on board. Are we now to be subjected to a barrage of shouting every time we shop? Its like an open air market for gods sake.",0,3
Aldi UK,Utterly Useless,"I bought a rowing machine online over three weeks ago. As Aldi continue to use the utterly useless XDP ""delivery service"", I never received the machine, with them claiming they tried to deliver it but I wasn't in. Unfortunately for them, my video cameras did not capture any delivery person at.my house. I immediately contacted Aldi's so called customer service. The advisor was hopeless. I waited a week then contacted them again as XDP's tracking showed my machine still at their warehouse. Three weeks in I have had no reply from Aldi, no rowing machine or no refund. In a world where Amazon set the benchmark in customer service, Aldi is woefully way behind. I will not purchase online from them again and if I don't receive a refund shortly will be reporting them to Trading Standards.",0,1

Aldi UK,Purchased a stand mixer,"Purchased a stand mixer, and due to covid and further kitchen issues I did not unpack until after the 60 day return policy was up. When I turned on the machine it sounded like their was a bag of loose bolts inside it, being extremely noisy, after looking at other customers reviews this was a common issue. I contacted Aldi Customer services and was told that although it had gone past the sixty days and due to the circumstances and that the machine had not been used, getting a refund would not be a issue. Several phone calls later this has still not been resolved. still no neare a refund and may be stuck with a mixer that has a known noise issue. Sorry Aldi you have lost a regular customer.",0,1

Aldi UK,Worse service possible.,"Worse service possible.I can only comment on Aldi's appalling customer service.I ordered a £699 computer on the 20/11/20 in time for Christmas you might think, Not a chance.

I had countless apologises, and a few customer service advisors said they would get back to me, NONE bothered.I was even told by email that a manager was going to call me, not a chance.Now I have been told it was lost, not this week no the 6/12/20.Theirs no more of this model available.

Aldi UK,Superb Value and Service!,"We've now had a few Aldi wine deliveries. If the order is over £30, it's delivered free and it typically arrives a day or two after ordering (the last one, next day!) I generally go for the orange label Rioja which is very palatable and way better than the £5.49 price tag would suggest. Think about it - why pay a wine company £90+ for 12 bottles of standard wine when Aldi delivers the same for around £65?",0,5
Aldi UK,TERRIBLE SERVICE,"Ordered a product online on 6th December which stated delivery within 3-5 working days. The item was dispatched 5 days later!!!

So then I ask for a refund which I was advised would be in my account by 8th January and also put in a complaint. Being aldi I got no response from complaint and no refund so I called and was advised 12th January. It is now the 12th January and will be calling in once lines open again as no refund received. My next report will be to watchdog as I'm sure a company can't take funds and just keep them from a person, basically aldi are acting like theives.",0,1

Aldi UK,Just shopped at Meteor Centre Derby…,"Just shopped at Meteor Centre Derby store which I do every week.I have come home in tears it was an awful experience. It had far too many customers, so much for the traffic light system, this clearly wasn't being controlled. So many customers did not bother sanitising their trolley or hands and there was no social distancing. There was no direction on the queuing system whilst most customers ( including me!) were queuing patiently down the aisle another customer pushed in from another direction to which I politely pointed out I was waiting. She refused to wait as she said another checkout operator had told her to go to this checkout! I moved to another checkout and made a complaint to the operator who took no interest at all. I was then humiliated by another customer who told me I shouldn't be complaining to staff and was very rude to me. All I wanted was an apology from the staff member.This experience has left me very anxious about shopping there in future, I certainly did not feel safe.I will not be shopping there again which is a shame as the store was so well organised at the beginning of the first lockdown.",0,1

Aldi UK,Stop buying at Aldi Westcliff on Sea! Very rude staff and not Covid safe!,"I went to Aldi Westcliff today, got a small trolley (no disinfectant for hands or trolleys, nobody at the door), some members of staff without a face mask on and one with the mask on her mouth only.My shopping cost me £196, so my trolley was stuffed and while I was at the till packing my stuff, I was told by the shop assistant to be quicker in a very direct way. I kindly explained that my trolley is a small one and my items were placed so that they fit and I couldn't just throw them in there as they wouldn't fit anymore, I tried to be quicker and at a point, the shop assistant from the next till said to the other: 'Let's swap and I will deal with this one.' Tammy, the 'lovely' shop assistant who replaced the man started shouting at me that I need to carry my stuff one by one on the large stand next to the windows as my trolley or she will not sell the goods to me anymore. It was one more bag to fill, I explained that I am done and I need to pay and she shouted again saying she won't let me pay because I didn't do what I was asked to do. She locked the till, git out and started shouting again without a mask on, very close to me and asked the body guard to get the trolley away with my personal bag in. I said they shouldn't take it away as I had my bag in so they agreed I can pay. Then, in a very humiliating way, she asked me to join the queue again if I want to pay, I did and after I paid, she didn't give me the receipt, but asked the bodyguard to take the trolley away as she had the impression I had taken a photo of her. I showed her I do not have any photos, I explained I was reading a message on whattsup, but she kept screaming. Then she came, snatched my phone and tried to look for the photo, no mask on, next to me, no social distancing. I asked for my phone back and she gave it to me and said she wouldn't give my goods to me (after I had paid them) or the receipt unless I show her my recycle bin. Meanwhile, she asked for another shop assistant to come, another lady with her face mask covering only her mouth, who started threatening me with the police and with the fact the bodyguard had a camera on and recorded me taking a photo.After a long time of explaining and asking to refund me the money or give me the items I had bought, Tammy, the very angry and rude shop assistant, agreed to refund me the money and asked me to join the very long queue again so that I can get my money back. I did. When I came in front of the till, she started typing each code from the receipt so that it takes a long time to finally refund a £196 receipt. Meanwhile, the other shop assistant and bodyguard were next to me threatening continuously... Disgusting!",0,1

Aldi UK,Utterly useless online service and non existent customer service,"I ordered a case of wine on 17th December. Aldi was advertising that it would be delivered in 3-5 working days. Like a fool, I believed this and assumed my wine would be with me by the 24th at the latest. After all I did want the wine for Christmas day lunch. There was no indication from Aldi that it couldn't be delivered in 3-5 working days i.e. by the 24th. Christmas came and went. No wine. New Year came and went and still no wine. As I write this on 7th January, I still don't have either the wine or a refund. It transpires that Aldi did eventually dispatch the case of wine but by this time, after eventually making contact with a CS person I told them that if they couldn't give me an actual delivery date just to cancel the order and refund me. Next thing I get an email from Aldi telling me some of the wine I'd ordered was out of stock so they would refund the price of that. Then I get an email from Yodel telling me to get excited as it wouldn't be long until they were delivering my parcel. I used their tracking system to find out where the wine was. It had got as far as Kilmarnock, about 25 minutes from where I live but had been stopped in its tracks and returned to Aldi. So, this was the only bit Aldi got right. To cancel the order! Really, you couldn't make this up! So right now, I'm still about £60.00 out of pocket in spite of emailing/phoning Aldi about this on a number of occasions. They have my money and I have nothing to show for it. This is basically just theft. It gives me no pleasure to write negative reviews but this is just beyond the pale. It goes without saying that I will never use Aldi's online service again and I'd advise people to think very carefully before risking their hard earned cash on a company that hasn't a clue. Shame I can't leave zero stars.",0,1

Aldi UK,Used the Bournemouth Store then…,Used the Bournemouth Store then received a £40.00 parking fine. I have provided the receipt to parking eye and been told Aldi will not accept it and still had to pay. I paid the bill and called Aldi who said they was not interested. I am absolutely disgusted that Aldi are ripping people off in this way especially during a time everyone is struggling. I would strongly advise anyone with a car does not use Aldi as your shopping bill will be a lot higher than expected. I would say Aldi receives commission for every fine given out.,0,1
Aldi UK,Fed up being overcharged.,"My local store is really going down hill. I am so fed up now of being overcharged for products that I did not buy or for products advertised at a lower price. I am now even being sold meat products passed there use by dates. Is this even legal. I am constantly buying bread that is stale as the plastic packaging has holes or rips in them. You cannot check the price going through the till and they are so quick to get you away from the till that when you are able to check your receipt that you are overcharged in the packing area or at home you are so fed up to go back as the queue is so long. The shopping baskets are dirty, the queues are so long with only 1-2 queues open and as an nhs worker myself I do not appreciate overhearing staff vocally complaining specifically about a 'healthcare worker' in full view of the public this is unprofessional. I think I have learnt my lesson now and will be better off shopping elsewhere as with all of this they are neither the cheapest in price or good for quality.",0,1

Aldi UK,Seacroft store lack of care regarding clean trollies,"Visited the Seacroft store on 23 December 2020. They haven't seen me again since and are not likely to either.No paper towels at the door or sanitizer to wipe the trolley. No nothing! On entry to the store, two members of staff were stacking the shelf with grapes and I spoke to one of them explaining the lack of sanitisation equipment and asked him to restock. He just looked at me and shield, ""so it needs replacing"" a statement, not a question and i said, well yes it does.I began shopping (i used my own hand gel to clean the trolley) and noticed that the staff member still had not restocked the sanitizer or towels at the door and asked if he wasn't going to action this he said that he would get round to it. Of course I was dismayed and reminded him of the covid situation abut he just ignored me and continued to stock the grapes.At this point I left the store and my groceries right there.I called customer service who were not concerned in the least but took my phone number and said they would pass my comment on to the store. Well Aldi, £157.00 food shop later at Asda was your loss, not mine.

Aldi UK,Aldi Garstang PR3 be careful shopping here,"Some of the till staff are often not wearing face coverings and even chin wearing. Behind a partial screen but those screens have openings out of necessity. Therefore, customer and till operator are very near as customer leans down for the items from shelf or to pay. So a till operator without a mask is breathing into the face of masked customer. EVEN WORSE when next adjoining till operator decides to leave the screened booth, no mask, speaks loudly, inches away from adjacent customer who receives a facefull of uncovered breath. NOT ACCEPTABLE. Should open every other till to alleviate such close contact. The rules state that face coverings are MANDATORY for retail staff....nowhere does it state that if staff are behind a partial screen then don't bother about protecting your customers!And it was like a scrum, shoppers everywhere, cant get past, no distancing at till, more like 1 foot than 2 metres, shelf stacking at tea time, can't safely get to products.

Not only do we use the gilblets as an integral part of making a stock for our gravy, my father-in-law has enjoyed the Turkey neck as part of his dinner for over 25 years.

Aldi UK,Very disappointed with this service,"Very disappointed with this service. It was difficult to use website and impossible to do it on smartphone. When I finally managed to place and pay for the order the confirmation and reminders were ok. However when I turned up to fetch it at the Bedford Fairhill branch, they had misplaced the order and had to recollect the whole thing making me wait for 45 minutes. The whole point of using the service was wasted and it’s not right. Sort yourself out please and don’t offer a service you can’t provide. The staff were nice and did their best but please give them better tools and don’t put them through the stress of angry customers when it’s not their fault. If the tech isn’t ready, postpone the launch.",0,1

Aldi UK,Rotten Fresh Turkey,"We purchased a fresh turkey crown from Aldi Sherwood Road, Bromsgrove on Tuesday 22/12/2020 which had a sell by date of the 26/12/2020. When we opened the packaging on Christmas Day, the turkey was slimy and had an awful smell. We washed the bird but the smell remained during the cooking process which left us no alternative but to throw the meat away, ruining our Christmas lunch, rather than risk food poisoning. The fresh turkey crown had gone off and a green tinge around the drum stick area. We returned the rotten turkey to the store it was purchased from and did receive a full refund. The very helpful member of staff said they were “so sorry that must of ruined your Christmas”, well yes it did. Christmas was ruined for nine people, including 3 elderly family members. This was not an isolated incident as when I was in the branch, staff commented on similar products still being found on sale on the shop floor. I emailed Aldi customer services and was eventually offered a £15 voucher as a gesture of good will, what an insult. After various emails they eventually offered a £20 voucher which barely covered my fuel costs of returning a product not fit for human consumption never mind a ruined Christmas Day for nine people. The emails to customer services are not read they are simply generic replies with the odd sentence being changed.",0,1

Aldi UK,Bad experience …,Made first online shopping order with Aldi of wine and spirits for £90. Ordered in plenty of time for Christmas. They use Yodel to deliver. I had to wait 11 days for a phone call from yodel to say they 'lost my order- in other words someone stole it. By this time nothing was left in stock and even though the person I spoke to from Aldi was very nice I still haven't got my money back. Bad experience and will never ever shop with them again. If I had realised they use dodgy yodel to deliver i actually never would have ordered. Very poor. I ended up just going to asda and buying it for the same price but branded products. Lesson learned.,0,1
Aldi UK,This refers to the actual supermarkets…,"This refers to the actual supermarkets not online shopping. My brother who has learning disabilities, illiterate, autistic, suffers with severe anxiety, usually in his daily routine goes and gets odds and sods, from the supermarket with a list. However when he ask member of staff for help, on numerous occasions, not only are they reluctant to help but make him feel very uncomfortable, isolated and not wanting to go shopping for a couple of days, then doesn’t want to enter certain shops because of the way they have made him feel. Not all disabilities are visible, and the sooner people realise this the better. No one should feel victimised in a supermarket of all places, being ignored like he’s invisible isn’t acceptable.",0,1
Aldi UK,"Had a problem, sorted it with out question","Firstly due to my husband health, we were offered priority delivery slots by Tesco and Asda. Which we didn’t take there offer. Also after this year, food is the least problem I should worry about. Due to an email on feedback, it bought me to TRUSTPILOT. I shop at Aldi, for the choice of food, I like the staff and I also find it convenient then a large supermarket, due to walking for to long. I have been a loyal customer. I managed to buy all items for Christmas dinner except the veg, due to sell buy date, as I shopped a week before Christmas. I also bought all my Christmas party food, which I treated my family to the luxury items after the year we have been through. Some items I bought had a good sell by date so kept them in the fridge. I put some stuff in my freezer and felt relieved that I could at least give my family a Christmas and due to having to self isolate most of the year, due to my husband having cancer. I hadn’t needed to go anywhere else. The few bits, like veg and milk my children would pick up. Well what a disappointment, Il start on the Christmas diner. I bought us a medium frozen turkey and a pork joint, which was full of fat, hardly no meat. The stuffing, I bought and placed it in the freezer. When it came to put in the oven, and was one slush. Thank goddess I had gravy.Now the party food was, The Indian selection was tasteless. Pastry products were hard. The cream was dated 27/12/2000 which we couldn’t use on Christmas Day, due to it being curdled. The mini pasties and scotch eggs had nothing in them. I bought your frozen mini chocolate eclairs and the caramel ones, which was another disappointment. Thank his to cheese and crackers. I don’t know what has happened to Aldi. I have never ever had any problems with your food. I really think this should be brought to your attention. As this is not your usual standards. I am pleased that it was only my bubble for Christmas, as I would of been so embarrassed, to have served what I did.Contacted them and responded very quick. Received a Refund for the items",0,5

I tried other nearby Aldi stores.....same outcome. However the experience I had at Aldi's Histon Road, Cambridge store was exceptional.Having drawn a blank on my first ever visit to the store, I asked a young lady if there was any chance of there being one elsewhere in the store. Martina (apparently the store Manager) said she would check. On her return she apologised but offered to take my phone number and ring me back if some came in with the overnight delivery. Happy with that arrangement, I was thrilled the next morning when she rang to say she had put on aside for me to collect. That went way beyond what I could have expected, and an example of great customer service. I picked the item up later that morning (22 Dec). THANK YOU AND WELL DONE MARTINA AND ALDI.",0,5

And given we’re now in tier 4, completely impossible to find replacements from another supermarket 2 days before Christmas. particularly annoying having to look round supermarkets to try and sort Xmas dinner at such late notice especially when I did Click and Collect to avoid physical shopping in the first place, let alone two days before Xmas!

Aldi UK,Just plain wrong,"Well, Thankyou Aldi for a feel good Christmas Eve experience. Stop searched because of.... no reason given. Flying around a few shops last minute on the hunt for advocaat or snowballs, I hurried into my local aldi store and straight to the alcohol isle. Quickly realising no advocaat on the shelves, I hurried through the checkout to leave and try elsewhere. Greeted by a hostile looking security guard who doesn’t discreetly greet me and ask, I might I add, asks that he can search my tote bag. I don’t look scruffy, I’m just a girl in hurry, if your profiling system is to stop somewhere wearing a big winter coat then you need to address that. I would have had to be Houdini to have stolen anything after I hadn’t even touched one thing on a shelf!! I was so shocked when he asked I just simply said yes, handed my tote and he realised he was wrong. No apology, no explanation. Pretty himiliating. Horrid experience. If this is to fall in line with store targets then shame on you. If you seriously suspect someone of stealing you should at least give a valid reason and certainly hold your hands up when your so massively off the mark!",0,1
Aldi UK,Non-existent online service,Ordered a case of wine from Aldi online on 17th December. Their website claims they deliver in 3-5 working days. As I write this on the 24th (5 working days later) my order has not yet even been processed. Why do they persist in making commitments they cannot meet? So who knows when this might be delivered? Sometime in 2021 perhaps. Really had hoped it would be here for Christmas. This is another high street retailer that simply hasn't a clue about online service and delivery. This was the first time I have ever used Aldi online and it will certainly be the last. Customer service also very difficult to get hold of. Shame it isn't possible to leave zero stars.,0,1

They could clearly see that the items had been returned to them from the on-line carrier tracking but still no budging them on the timeline for processing the refund - the guy on the phone just kept reading the script.Will get my wine elsewhere in future....hence the vote with your feet!,0,1

Well, you know what they say? Buy cheap, expect cheap! They were dreadful. Bruised outside and a few bad inside. Not crisp and totally tasteless. Have ended up feeding them to the horses! Awful! I also bought plums and ended up throwing them away!! Tasteless and unpleasant texture. In the store itself, despite traffic light system, which we noticed stayed on green most of the time, it was packed full of people!! Exiting store no sanitiser to use whilst entering there is an untidy mess aplenty of the stuff. Why none on exiting? Furthermore, cannot understand why a pound still has to be paid for trolley which surely adds to problems of possible cross contamination!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Very poor experience with online wine delivery,"My experience with Aldi wine mirrors situations already described by other customers. I ordered 6 bottles of various wines and spirits for online delivery two weeks before Christmas. On the day the goods were supposed to be delivered, I got an e-mail from Yodel with the delivery time. Then a few hours later when nothing was delivered, I checked the Yodel website to see the following: ""We tried to deliver your parcel but it was refused at the door due to damage. Please contact the sender with any queries."" Nobody had been at my door, there was no calling card left. I called Aldi customer service, was put on hold, then cut off, had to call again and tell the whole story only to be told that no replacement order could be sent and I had to wait 14 days to get a refund. Days later, I still do not have the refund and have not received any communication from the company or response to my complaint. I like Aldi wines but their service is rubbish.",0,1
Aldi UK,"Right or wrong, decide for yourself 🤔","Although I am exempt from wearing a mask I still wear one to be polite to others, I wear an exemption badge to show I'm exempt in case I need to temporarily remove the mask due to wearing masks I have mucus from nostrils that has now backed up and blocked my ear, I have 2 hidden disabilities and it's better that I periodically drop my mask below my nose or mouth rather than vomit 🤮 projectile. On entering Aldi in Preston this morning wearing a mask I felt nauseous 🤢 after inhaling a staff members cigarette smoke, a staff member who was sheltering near the main entrance from the rain smoking, knowing that the smoke I inhaled had been in the lungs of someone who may or may not have covid is sickening to start with, he was in uniform and I presume he was the security. After I had done my small shop I was at the till socially distanced from the man in front of me but could not help the fact that the woman behind me was not applying social distancing, I removed my mask to avoid any further dizzyness clearly displaying my exemption card and was about to replace my mask as I approached the cashier when the man in front of me suddenly verbally attacked me for not wearing a mask which resulted in an argument. You can decide for yourselves who is right or wrong after all it's a free country..

Aldi UK,The worst customer service ever,"Beware of buying online with Aldi. We ordered more than £90 of wine in late November, paying an extra £3.95 for named day delivery. Nothing arrived on the day. Enquiries with Yodel (impossible to contact directly) stated it was “delayed”. After several days the message changed and informed us that the goods were damaged and we should contact Aldi.8 lengthy phone calls and 3 weeks later we have still not received a refund. The Customer Service staff are very polite and apologetic but they do NOTHING. Every time, they promise a refund but no refund is made. No manager is ever available to speak with and no manager can ever find the time to call back. 3 promised call backs by Customer Service staff were never made. The apologies therefore seem hollow. If the value of the order had been less, I can imagine many customers would give up. It looks as if either this is company policy or culture or there is some system failure within Aldi’s online orderings department.So, think hard before you take the risk.",0,1

Aldi UK,Don't lose your receipt if you buy…,"Don't lose your receipt if you buy electrical goods from Aldi. I've bought several over the years as they didn't seem too bad. You get what you pay for though, especially with the circular saw I recently bought. I bought mine for a job and didn't use it for a month, by which time I had unfortunately lost the receipt. The saw cut through quarter inch ply effortlessly then stopped after one pass, never to work again. I contacted customer services who put the phone down on me when I asked them to wait a second while I found a pen. I tried again and spoke to a friendly lady who gave me a reference number to give to the staff at the store I'd bought the item from. When I got to the checkout I was told the item was sold for £1.59!!! Obviously this was wrong, so the manager was called who, after leaving me standing there for ten minutes and despite being given the customer services reference together with a copy of my bank statement, all but called me a liar and said I ""must have had the saw over a year""! As I shop here every week I was disgusted by his adversarial attitude to say the least. Basically I was refused a refund so I left the saw with the manager who can put it in the best place for it - the bin. My fault for losing the receipt, but their customer services should not have wasted my time by giving me a reference number that was neither use nor ornament. That's £40 I'll never see again.

Aldi UK,Very poor online order experience,"Online order placed 4th Dec. Aldi despatched 7th Dec via Hermes. On the 9th Hermes delivery tracking reports ""we've got your parcel and it's on its way but a major event is slowing us down."". Contacted Aldi via online chat on 15th. Told they will contact Hermes and get back to me with an update in 72 hours. 72 hours later no update from Aldi and no change to delivery tracking. So on the 18th I phone Aldi. The call center doesn't appear to have any connection with the online chat. They can't find any record of me contacting them on the 15th. Told as there is no record of me contacting them they need to request an update from Hermes meaning I have to wait another 72 for a response from Hermes. I’m not prepared to wait another 72 hours so Aldi request a Return to Sender from Hermes. Aldi will then issue a refund once the item has been returned to them. Considering that the parcel tracking hasn’t been updated for 9 days it doesn’t look the parcel will make it back to Aldi anytime soon. If 14 working after requesting the return to sender Aldi don't get the parcel back from Hermes they consider it lost and issue a refund. This will be on 7th Jan. So I am now missing a Christmas gift and the money to buy an alternative. Aldi's chosen courier appears to be inadequate. Aldi’s processes and procedures for dealing with these situations are unsatisfactory. Extremely poor experience buying online from Aldi. Won't be buying from Aldi online again and I would strongly advise everyone else to avoid as well.

Promised a small value of store credit as a good will gesture. I am yet to receive this. Now left with no Christmas gift, no explanation, slow refund and no promised good will gesture.

Aldi UK,Another ugly experience with Josephine TW3 Aldi !!!,"Yet another unpleasant experience with Josephine the Aldi Hounslow sales attendant.Despite her grumpy attitude treating me with contempt, l overlooked her usual unprofessional rude service and whilst l was trying to pay her, l gave her a £10 note, trying to pour the remaining coins into her palm, she blotted out - ""No, take your shopping off the till desk and pour the coins there""....Now irritated at her utter lack of customer service, l asked, ""Why are you refusing the money? l am trying to pay for my shopping, you just took the £10 note, what is wrong with putting the coins in your palm for you to count them?""Any sales cashier attendant would quickly apologise and get her act together, but as anticipated, she the villain turned around playing the victim, ""Why do you have to snap at me? you are rude, next time, don't come to my till.""Like l told you Josephine, You have a bad attitude with customers, and if you have a problem providing customer service and attending to customers with decorum, by all means stay off the tills and work in the store, there the inanimate food items will not be hurt by your condescending manners. Customer service means serving the customer regardless of the age difference, not expecting the polite well meaning genuine customers to serve you, if you have a problem providing that, you should open your own business where you can unjustly turn down customers payments to suit your bad moods.Aldi tills are not your personal bedroom that you should treat people who come to you like invasive nuisance.Tills are a work station for you to SERVE customers. l will not suffer a long queue on a different till, whilst your till is virtually vacant because other customers are trying not to fall prey to your abusive customer service. l will go to any tills l please, if you want the transaction to go just as you want, by all means pay for the customers shopping yourself. If customers treated their bosses who pay them, the way Aldi staff treat their customers, everyone will be out of work. If Aldi was your personal business, you would have a better attitude and never turn down a customer's payment unjustly.Aldi management had better have a staff rating machine for every sales attendant on the tills, that way they can improve with EVERY customer.It's ironic the polite staff are made to stack up the shelves and the temperamental erratic ones are put on the tills to upset customers.....what a chicanery of service!",0,1

The rear of the shop to see members of staff fighting, a white guy with braided ponytale was punching the black samarlian guy, then two other members of staff join to restrain the guy with the braided ponytail there was a female member of staff there too with redish maroon hair, then another short older Spanish type shop assistant came to help and as doing so I saw him kick the guy that had the ponytail.It was all very disturbing and upsetting, I hate violence and just being in the shop was giving me a panic attack and I wasn't ready to end my shopping but this incident cut my shopping trip short.I don't think I could ever bring myself to go back into this store. When you feel trapped in a store and hear this unfolding and not sure how to be safe in case of walking head on into the path of this ironic behaviour.There were 5-6 members off staff all down one isle and there was food stock flying in the isle.This gave me a panic attack and I felt very disturbed by what I witness among staff, if thus is how the staff treat each other it could quite easily have been a customer.I called ALDI customer service as soon as I got home as was totally disgusted with what I was seeing. I heard a supervisor saying to the guy with the ponytail, ""you have just lost your job"".Lost for words, don't feel safe shopping here again...",0,1

Aldi UK,Just been to my local Aldi in Kingston…,Just been to my local Aldi in Kingston Upon Thames. While I was in there I heard shouting and screaming and was frightened it was a terrorist attack as there was lots of loud bangs.Trying to get to safely I actually witnessed 5 guys brawling on the floor. One was being held down and kicked and there was lots of swearing going on. I was terrified. A supervisor came over and I realised that they were actually staff members fighting. The supervisor told the main culprit that he had lost his job and she was going to phone the police. He threatened back that a girl colleague would need the police. It was an appalling site to witness and has left me very shaken. There were threats made and punches still being thrown and abusive language. I never did finish my shopping and left feeling quite ill and shaken,0,1
Aldi UK,Beware online ordering,"£180 worth of AirPods in their fake Black Friday Sale have gone missing. Two people I actually know personally have had the same problem! So six pairs of AirPods all mysteriously missing in my circle of friends. Could be thousands across the country! Customer service friendly enough but you automatically get cut off after a few minutes so you go round in circles telling the same old story to a new person for them to do nothing. So, no main presents for my daughters, no refund as yet with which to at least buy some from a proper retailer and no interest from Aldi. Beware they use Hermes, well known for shoddy service and ‘losing’ expensive items. Shop is fine, please take heed and never order online.",0,1

Aldi UK,Shockingly bad from Aldi!,"People of Great Britain, shopping online at Aldi is the new National Lottery. If you like surprises, you've come to the right place! In effect, the order you placed and paid for in good faith may or may not be delivered. And if it isn't it will be up to you to dig around and make enquiries as to the (dubious) reasons for this failure, for which you will get no apology, replacement, goodwill gesture or money back for a good few weeks. Amazing right? Maybe this should be Aldi's next Christmas advert.I ordered 6 bottles of various wines and champagne online for delivery. I got an email to say the goods would be delivered on the 11th. On the day I got a mail from Yodel saying it would be with me at a certain time. Then a few hours later another to tell me the goods had arrived damaged and could not be delivered. Having not heard from Aldi about this after 4 days I decide to enquire by phone only to be told I had to wait 7 days before a new order could be sent out, in case the damaged one, which I was told could not be delivered, was still delivered!? NAturally unhappy and shocked at the news, I then proceed to write to Aldi (customer.service at aldi.co.uk) to be told in a badly written email that unfortunately there is no more stock of the items ordered and that I should wait up to 14 days for a refund, but only once the broken goods had been returned to the warehouse! So basically I have no goods, no replacement, no apology for the inconvenience, no gesture and no refund for weeks. Thanks Aldi.My advice, pay a few quid more and shop with a reputable retailer that actually cares about their customers and the service they provide. Pretty much every other supermarket out there.Shockingly bad from Aldi! Not spending a penny more with these incompetent fools.Update 18/01: 1 month later, only part refund received, no explanation, still waiting for the full refund, no answer from customer service after 9 days. Congratulations Aldi for your consistency in maintaining a terrible service.",0,1

Aldi UK,Not great for quality. Prices kind of make up for it,"The reason I give two stars instead of one is due to the fact that the prices are great, meaning you save a lot of money. There are some downsides though. The quality of the products however is to a lower standard compared to supermarkets such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose etc. When it comes to fruit, in particular, I would certainly purchase from other stores due to the quality of the fruit being especially poor in Aldi. Apples and blueberries are sour, raspberries go off the following day whilst the kiwis were rock hard and way too under-ripe. Furthermore, the dairy products aren't great either. Their eggs are nowhere near as good as from other places; they have yellow egg yolks meaning they are not as rich in nutrients and some of the eggshells even have feathers on them. Disgusting. Also, the feta cheese stinks, it's horrible. In terms of vegetables and meals such as Quiches, Aldi is actually pretty decent. They produce some good quality food with the 'specially Select' items such as the Pies and Quiches which have a delightful buttery pastry. I'm also a fan of the rest of their 'Specially Select' range such as sourdough bread, crisps and red onion chutney. These are all very nice. Also, I have had no problem with their vegetables. Generally speaking, I would personally stick to other supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Waitrose etc hence why I gave no more than two stars. This is because although you may be spending a little more, it's certainly worth it due to the noticeable increase in the quality of the products amongst the variation in products being significantly higher.",0,2

Aldi UK,Poor on line platform- just to better,"UPDATED MARCH 2021 - We have updated our review and moved the rating from 2 to 4 stars as we have now received another 2 orders now and communications were good , indeed part of one of the recent orders was out of stock and we had the update and refund in very good time indeed - the refund was in our account before the rest of the order arrived, so spot on there. The subsequent delivery through yodel was also very good. In essence this has gone from a one star review to a 4 star one- Good effort to Aldi for sorting some of the gremlins in their system. ORIGINAL REVIEW - The online platform is not great and is dragging the reputation of this company down. We have tried to place 2 orders with them. The first I had to chase and then discovered they were out of stock and could only fulfil half the order, the half order arrived nearly 2 weeks late. I have no idea how long they would have kept me waiting had I not chased the order. We thought we would give ALDI another chance and ordered cookware from them (cast iron casserole set). It took ages to get out the warehouse with no order updates but as stated above once it did leave the warehouse things picked up and the quality of the goods was excellent. We initially gave ALDI a one star review but to be fair the second order did eventually arrive so we feel to be fair to ALDI the on line process is not good but better than the one star we initially gave them, hence amending this review to reflect the slightly better second experience. They still need to sort out how they keep customers updated of any issues with the orders.",0,4

Aldi UK,Well it the same old with big companies…,"Well it the same old with big companies they say they care about customers/care. But in my case this is totally untrue and unfounded and on a few occasions. I've sent emails about certain products good and bad but I get nothing absolutely nothing from them. I might b just one customer 4 them but I should still get the best customer service and I don't. It's all about the money and share holders 4 them as I go to my local branch in Bridgwater Somerset. And I spend a lot of money well I think so anyway but I have noticed now that the items r getting alot smaller but almost stay the same price. And they say they make it cheap and good shopping at aldis absolutely a bull of crap 4 me in my opinion. I buy there bread within a week it goes off, the same with the milk, and with the orange and apple juice even though I put it in my fridge and it has a long sell by date. It goes off and all cloudy in the apple and apple juice. In my opinion they r cutting corners just to keep the customers? And don't care one bit about the quality of products the customer gets in there stores. And don't get me on the crisps it's hardly worth buying them it wouldnt satisfy a rat? Let a line a human it's borderline pathetic what the customer gets in the crisp packets now. And they almost taste that they r at the end of there sell by date hardly any crunch just a bit out of date. And the new lidls have a self tills so the customer can do it themselves and move on quickly. Aldis didn't do this in the new store in Bridgwater and they definitely missed a trick on that one. But yet again did they think of the customer I think not and then u can go in the day and the shelves r half empty. But u feel so awkward if u as a member of staff as they look so fed up and tired. It's seems to much 4 them to help u the customer. But then aldis get the staff 2 do 2 jobs 4 one wage I wouldn't expect anything different from a German company.",0,1

Aldi UK,Dreadful customer service,"Dreadful customer service. On November 30th, I bought £266 of wine from Aldi online with a 3-5 day delivery promise. The wine arrived with DHL on December 8th. Shortly after delivery, I realised that a box of 12 bottles of Spanish Priorat was missing. I called ‘Customer Service’. What a terrible experience. The person told me that he could see that 3 boxes of wine had been dispatched but he could see photographic evidence from DHL that only 2 had been delivered and so he would open an enquiry case into the event. I said that the case was missing and should be replaced but was told that Aldi does not consider a delivery item to be missing until 7 days after it’s due delivery date. I called back the following day and got the same story from a different person and insisted in speaking to a supervisor or managerial person because I wasn’t happy with the explanation. He refused saying he was working from home and wouldn’t refer the case to management because he was following procedure. It’s now December 13th and I still don’t have a response from Aldi. The £266 has already been charged to my account but I’m short on £107 worth of wine and cannot get a reasonable response from Aldi. I will never buy online from this company again.",0,1

Everything was listed except ""where is my delivery?"" or a contact email address. I eventually found an Aldi email address via google. I received a reply from Lauren Mitchell, Aldi's customer service advisor referring to my query ""where are my 600 coffee pods?"". Ms Mitchell told me that my coffee pods had been damaged in transit on it's way to me. Ms Mitchell also told me I had to wait until the damaged parcel had been returned to their depot and then wait a further 14 ""working days"" for a refund.

I waited 10 days still no refund so I called Aldi customer service again what a difference this time! No record of my previous phone call. Partial refunds were not possible so the whole hamper needed to be returned I should have taken pictures of the damage etc etc. I insisted the previous promise of a partial refund be honoured the call lasted 47 frustrating minutes the call handler could not make decisions and had to email a manager with each point I made and wait for a reply.

We contacted Aldi to explain the poor quality of their product.

Aldi UK,Ordering wine from Aldi - my experience,"I ordered a mixed half case of premium wines for Christmas. When the delivery arrived I opened it to discover that half of the £20 Pomerol bottles had been replaced with £4.49 Malbec Syrah bottles. Aldi customer services hot line was very efficient and the staff are friendly. The first customer services team member I spoke to was very helpful but appeared to do very little. The following day I called again and the customer service person was extremely helpful and arranged a collection and replacement service using Yodel. Yodel were due to collect the package but went to the wrong address and after some dispute agreed it was their fault but still declined to resolve the issue meaning I had to call Aldi again. Third time speaking to Aldi customer services- again a great experience and hopefully the problem would be resolved. Again nothing happened so I called again a week later to be told that someone ‘senior’ had to sign off on the replacement and this hadn’t happened. I called today to be told it was still not signed off but they were now out of stock of the wine I’d ordered in November and Thus I was offered a refund. What a complete shambles - I’ve had to do all the chasing to correct Aldi’s error and to find out what was happening. Whilst the customer services team are very helpful the team they support have completely messed up my order, took far to long to correct their error, leaving me without the wine I wanted. Not a great first experience of ordering wine online from Aldi and a warning for those buying wine as gifts to check what you’ve been sent. I just hope Aldi come good and refund my money. At present they have my money and I have nothing but disappointment!A week later now and I still have not had my money back - is this the sort of experience you want!",0,1

On order and all emails stated we would receive within 5 days; seemingly didn't arrive at Hermes (not our favourite courier as had problems with 4 out of 5 parcels sent by large retailers using them), for 5 days then didn't move for days. Contacted Aldi (twice)...their agreement with Hermes is that they don't do anything until Hermes have had parcel for 7 working days (ie Monday to Friday as obviously neither Aldi nor Hermes work 7 day weeks). Guess what...at the end of the various wait times, they can't find it. During this time Aldi had contacted Hermes and had been told that they couldn't find the parcel...but hadn't let us know...even though they knew we were upset at the lack of delivery and we could have been ordering an alternative.All the customer services staff we spoke to were ever so sorry and fully understood our disappointment / frustration... We asked one to register a complaint which he said he had, but no response. When I worked in the NHS, and other businesses that we know have a 2 day turnaround for acknowledgement of a complaint...obviously not so with Aldi...and try finding a complaints policy on their website!!!At the end of all this, we have been offered a goodwill gesture of £10...the maximum they ever give. This does not address the fact that we specifically wanted the tepee from Aldi which is no longer available, and whilst waiting, we have seen alternatives go out of stock on-line. To add insult to injury, the parting comment (obviously from a script) is...""we do hope that you will order from us in future""!!!! Why would we?! My recommendation would be to look elsewhere to save disappointment.",0,1
Aldi UK,Love Aldi!,Have just started buying from Aldi again after all my parcels were regularly opened or vandalised by Hermes. Aldi were very understanding when I returned damaged items.

I have checked with neighbours and have been out looking for my 2 parcels but to no avail. So either a neighbour has taken them or it was never actually delivered.

Aldi UK,We visited Aldi Gillingham,"We visited Aldi Gillingham, Dorset this evening. We are super regular and don’t normally have issues apart from the usual grumpy teenager on the till. This evening though was different. The shop was empty. There were two tills open. We started to load up and the assistant said, “I’m closed”. The other till was heavily laden and the lady before us had few items, like us. My husband had already loaded our shopping and the assistant, Amy, barked “Im closed, I’m going home”. The manager on shift was too busy talking into his ear piece and walked off. When our items were then next to scan, they were thrown through with no care (not strange for Aldi) but the force was deliberate. Amy then proceeded to state the price, no please, no thank you, no eye contact. Once I had tapped my card on the reader, she slammed her till closed sign on the belt and couldn’t even wait for us to take the receipt before she ripped the cash draw out and stormed off. I’d like to point out here that the green/red till number lights were not on and there was no red “till closed” bar on the belt. And since we had 5 item, I did not see there being a problem since the other tills belt was loaded full!",0,1

Aldi UK,STOP RESTOCKING AT PEAK TIMES PLEASE,"Why do they always insist on packing shelves at the Motherwell stores most busiest times?! Tired of being expected to not only navigate a trolley through narrow gaps while they have those HUGE loading pallets, cardboard boxes etc in the middle of the already narrow aisles but also having to leave said trolley unattended (with shopping from other stores on there) because it's impossible to peruse the shelves/fridge cabinets/freezers whilst several workers are restocking (and blocking the way) already full to the brim shelves etc albeit with mostly near to best before dates items which incidentally is why it's impossible to just pick the first item you lay your hands on as you pass, (gotta check them dates right?) AND be mindful of letting other shoppers passed! It just makes an already stressful experience much harder to cope with plus it's like 100 degrees with those awful overhead blow heaters. Surely it's sales 101 to offer your customers a pleasant stress free shopping experience otherwise they won't want to spend anymore time than they have to in your store ergo spend a lot less than they might otherwise. I would probably spend a small fortune on your special buy aisles but since I can never actually get to see what's on offer because of your employees blocking the way I never even bother to look.

Aldi UK,You get what you pay for,"I've used Aldi for a long time and there is an old adage - you get what you pay for.

Deal with it.They probably work their staff pretty hard to make sure they get every penny of value out of their (quite generous) wages. So the staff are not going to be all smiles and rainbows. You wouldn't be either.Yes, it is annoying that the place is full of rude people; not really Aldi's fault. Yes, the staff launch your shopping at you from the checkout; that is quite tedious. BUT - the same £70 weekly shop in Aldi costs me £100 in Tesco. I take the £30 and have a fun afternoon with my family.And in all fairness, the Trent Vale staff are actually all pretty friendly when you're at the checkout, they're generally courteous when you're about the shop.

Sent it back in September and was told that it could not be repaired or replaced and that we would get a refund but it could take 4 weeks. Up to now 23rd November we have received nothing. I contacted Customer Service and they are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. They advised me the company who deal with the warranty items is nothing to do with Aldi. They then said that they would put me in the queue for their own warranty department to deal with my query. And they would contact company that deals with Aldi’s warranties. He said I would have to wait for them to contact me. Could not give me a time frame. When asked if I could contact them direct I was told that Aldi only has one telephone for the whole of the company. And that is Customer Service 0800 042 0800. I asked to speak to a manager and he said that there was no one there. He did offer to take me out of the warranty Queue and put me in the queue for a manager to ring me but it could take 2 days ?? He then said once I had spoken to a manager I would then have to go back in the warranty department queue and then it would take longer to be dealt with.I have never heard of anything so appalling for a Company as large as Aldi. Oh I asked if he could not issue me with the refund and he said NO. He said if he gave refunds out like that the company would cease to exist. All we are talking about here is £35.

I have spoken with them everytime and last week, as well as being apologetic, they offered me a £10 goodwill gesture. Whilst this didn't cover the bank charges I could have incurred for going overdrawn, (had we not been fortunate enough to have enough money to cover it and could transfer money immediately into the account) I appreciated the gestureToday the same issue occurred. My shopping bill was a little shy of £120, Aldi currently have all of it but are holding £120 also.I explained the issue. I was polite although I grant, a little less cordial than previously. The 'helpful' customer service agent informed my that numerous people were having this problem. (I would suggest only Aldi are having this problem and it is impacting lots of people but maybe I'm being picky) and that they would not refund the money (I don't want it refunding, as previously they've just released the held money and it appears back in my account), nor will they cover any bank charges if there are any but most impressively because, and I quote ""you have already had a gesture of goodwill so we won't give you another one'. Now I didn't ask for a GoG, she raised the issue, because frankly its not good enough but to suggest that because, historically they've put something right, then they don't have to do it again when they make another mistake. Can you imagine driving into someone, paying for the damage and then driving into them again and saying 'sorry paid up last time I made a mistake so not going to do it this timeExact same shop order into Asda online came in £7 more expensive and they'll deliver for £3, unlike click and collect and £5.

Aldi UK,Abysmal customer service. Don't expect your deliveries on time!,"I ordered their ""Special Buy"" PC last week on the note that it would be delivered in 3-5 working days. Thursday came and I hadn't received an update so I rang and was told to wait until Friday (the 5th working day). This morning I received an email from the delivery firm they use xdp stating that they haven't received my order yet. So I rang up again and asked what was going on only to be informed that it could still be out for delivery and I should wait until the end of today/Monday. I asked to raise a complaint as the order was due today. Only to be told again to wait until Monday because it would take 72 hours for a manager to speak to me. Using common knowledge I told the guy on the phone I wanted to raise the complaint now because on Monday it would be another 72 hours before I would receive a response from management. He then said he'd pop me on hold whilst writing up the complaint only to have the phone put down on me minutes later. 4 hours later I received an email stating my item was out for delivery (obviously unless they have a time machine I would not be receiving my computer today) so I contacted the team again. Once again told that it had been sent for delivery and to sit tight... Whilst on the phone I clicked the tracking link to see XDP state they still had not received the delivery. The guy on the phone this time told me it might come Monday and that I should sit tight. I requested a refund to be told they could not do this and that even if they could it would take 14 days for the refund to process. Absolute abysmal customer service, they really don't want to help you but just to tell you their system won't let them do anything.

Aldi UK,Terrible customer services on many occasions…,"Terrible customer services on many occasions! If you have a few extra pennies, shop main supermarket chains, at least you get good customer service for paying a bit extra.Where should I start with examples? At their customer parking lot where all the ""bad boys"" break all parking rules? It is highly upsetting at peak times to see lots of cars parked on double yellow lines and even red lines, blocking everyone else's access and creating chaos. Also they park on ""family"" parking spots even if they shop solo, this is putting me off so many times. They don't seem to care to regulate this issue. They want to attract customers, I get it, but the bad parking customers are discouraging the law-abiding customers from parking and shopping there. Parking rules are the same for everybody, no one is above the law, not even Aldi shoppers in a private parking. The other issue I have with the first infant formula, which seemed to be missing from the shelves for the first few weeks in November. I have twin babies and rely on this brand for their exclusive feeding, so it was extremely stressful to find empty shelves with no prior warning. I asked a staff member who quite unhelpfully said it's probably being discontinued, so I called customer services to be told the same, they don't have stock and they don't know when or if it gets back in stock. I asked to be updated either way. No news. One week later, I called back customer service, same story, no one knew when the item would be back. Again I asked to be kept up to date if it's back or discontinued completely. No news again. I made further arrangements for the babies' formula and today I saw it back on the shelves. Well you lost me as a customer, if you can't be bothered to update me as you promised to do. Lastly, their security staff is beyond rude, during the first lockdown I was heavily pregnant, the queues were huge and there was no priority queue for pregnant, disabled, etc. The only place I could skip queue being pregnant with twins was Lidl, I will forever be grateful. Since the babies were born, I go to shop with them in the double buggy, not once was I allowed to skip queue, once one guard was so rude, he sent me back to queue twice because he was under the impression I ""jumped"" the queue, when in fact a gentleman allowed me to go in front of his. It was just disgusting to treat a paying customer like that, when I (used to) shop at least twice a week, Aldi being my closest supermarket.",0,2

Proceeded to threaten and abuse.. it was only the action of another security guard who calmly spoke to me and apologised for their behaviour that I didn't react in kind.. which my hidden disability makes me usually respond to when threatened.

Contacted aldi no kitchens left so would get a refund.No refund after 7 days called them got an apology and told item cleared at warehouse so he would process refund call disconnected at this point.E. Mailed costomer services they rang apologised and said i would get a refund on 26th of November ! One whole month after they took my money ! Why i asked it takes two weeks to clear returns in the warehouse he said i said ive been told it has cleared no it hasnt was the reply by the end of the call and numerous apologies i am still without any refund !!!!!!!! He did offer me a 5 pound voucher as a good will gesture however i pointed out that that would not buy my grandaughter a play kitchen which i cannot buy untill i get my refund ! Overall shocking service i have got there returns policy and whilst it says money will be refunded when the item has cleared through warehouse it does not tell you that will take up to 14 working days ! I am taking this further and will continue with my complaint,0,1

Aldi UK,I’m astounded why Aldi are so popular…,"I’m astounded why Aldi are so popular apart from being thrown through the tills, staff in one store today think it’s ok to sneeze into their hands and just carry on serving a customer no hand cleansing. Fresh products were awful, old and damaged and the custard tarts.. YUK! Their buyers must have no sense of taste or standards just bland cardboard encased mush. No thanks. Complaint made to Aldi so wait for the response.",0,1
Aldi UK,Don't bother. You'll regret it!!,"I wasn't introduced to the management team or workforce on my first day. I wasn't shown the ropes properly.

Aldi UK,Poor quality,"Products have gone downhill recently & prices increased - so much so I will return to the other high street supermarkets now. I have shopped at Aldi for many years and am extremely disappointed with the products in recent times. I bought the ""new"" dishwasher tablets - do not bother unless you are happy to wash up before & after using your machine. They fail to clean & leave a residue on everything, one wash back with a branded item & all good again - Aldi straight in the bin.",0,1
Aldi UK,Terrible customer service,Twice recently I have needed to contact Aldi customer service. It really is pitiful. The most recent was a paid for next day deliver. When contacting them the auto response said we will be in touch in 5 to 7 days. That’s pathetic. Gear your business up to deliver a decent service. The delivery was 5 days late and no suggestion of a refund of the premium delivery. Just a very poor email. No explanation just. “It’s now been delivered” This is the second time I have had to contact customer service the first was no better. Not sure if the agents need some serious training of if the company are just overcome with arrogance. Either way I know I can’t rely on them.,0,1
Aldi UK,Zero customer service,Zero customer service - once they have your money that's the end. I have two good examples of poor service - the first was a piece of steak that was quite literally inedible (although it was supposed to be premium); the second was a 3D printer which was completely non-functional. Response in both cases - zero,0,1
Aldi UK,Don't order online!,I placed an order on 5 Nov. Advised by the carrier of a problem delivering on 11 Nov and advised to contact Aldi. Aldi said goods damaged in transit and refund could not be processed until damaged goods returned to their warehouse. Refund may then take up to 14 days. I have registered my annoyance with Aldi. They can't fulfil order as goods now out of stock and refuse to process refund without delay. I will not be ordering from Aldi again. Monica Thorogood.,0,1

May I add I paid £10 for a large goods delivery.Anyway I got an email to say the dressing table had been shipped then the next day I received another email saying it was out of stock and I would receive a refund within the next 3-5 working days.The cafe was attempted delivery but no one was in (yet we was in all day and no deliveries ever came) tried rearranging a delivery date with no reply back from them. After 4 days I contacted Aldi and they said to give it 3 more days, 3 days later my parcel arrived, with the box badly damaged!So I rang Aldi the next day to chase my refund for the dressing table, I was told to wait until they 11th. The 11th came and still no refund so I rang again and was told she had processed it and to wait a couple of days. Which it's been 4 days since then and guess what still no refund. Been on the phone again today and now their saying next Monday. This is appalling I want my money back!I'd advise no one to use Aldi online to make purchases as its a shambles.",0,1

Aldi UK,ALDI shameful handling of this year's Kevin the Carrot merchandise.,"In my opinion Aldi UK are uncaring and totally out of touch with UK customers. They launched their online sales of Kevin the Carrot seasonal merchandise but were woeful with their handling of it. They say they are supportive of the Teenage Cancer Trust but only to a limit that suits them. It is great that they pledge £15,000 but due to the popularity of the Kevin range they could pledge so much more in a similar way other stores support Children in Need. They have disappointed so many families by falling way short of meeting the demand for their range that they have carefully encouraged. Now in a year where millions of people are dying from an invisible virus they are forcing customers to now congregate in their stores where they will not be efficient at handling the large crowds that will gather at the times they say to fight for the merchandise that they have pitiful amounts of. Why do they not not provide an online marketing survey to know exactly what their customers want. This way everyone will be satisfied as customers get what they want, Aldi produce only what is needed so that nothing is left on the shelf and the greedy Ebay crowd aren't allowed to profiteer. It seems quite simple to me and would be a much more caring way of helping people in their times of need.",0,1
Aldi UK,Shambolic experience,"A visit to Brecon store heralded no fabulous five offers on fruit,a totally disorganised offers aisle and a lengthy wait at checkout as there was only one operative whose aisle was being cleaned.",0,1
Aldi UK,No complaints at all,I'm finding it really strange that Aldi has such a low rating. Maybe the store at wood gate Leicester is particularly good but I have absolutely no complaints every time I go there. Staff are helpful and smile even when the queues are huge and they are under pressure to get queues down. I can hands on heart say I have never had issues at Aldi. I've also been to the one on St George's retail park and the near one near Hamilton and not experienced anything remotely bad so I am very surprised to see all the negativity to be honest.,0,5
Aldi UK,Diabolical !,"We buy the Kevin the Carrot range every year. Had a feeling it would be difficult this year due to covid (I accept that). However. The mislead and mess customers around by posting that they’re getting put in stores throughout November (I screenshot it and it is from your official advisors on the page) to then delaying it to December... Yet people have posted that they already have them from purchasing in store. Before they even went on sale online. Don’t even get me started on the diabolical attempts at getting them online. If your website can’t allow me to pay, don’t let so many people on the site. I didn’t mind waiting in the online queue, but to wait 2 hours and then NOT be able to check out. I only managed to get the carrot bundle in my basket as it was at the new friends bundle apparently sold out in 15-20 mins.What an absolute mess around. Just tell customers the date & stick to it!",0,1
Aldi UK,I don't want to go into detail,"I don't want to go into detail, it is about harassment Any more detail is a waste of time I have left complaints here in the past and sent them to ALDI for review.

I don't know what else to do, but it's affecting me in ways that I can't put into words",0,1
Aldi UK,Always shop in Aldi Bridgend BUT,"I always shop in Aldi Bridgend & I’m not going to lie I’m not sure if I will stop shopping there because of this, which is sad because they are super cheap and affordable. but honestly, do yourselves a favour and train your staff to respect others. My partner and I were doing our weekly shop yesterday around 12pm when the woman behind till 6 refused to let us put our items in our trolly bags, saying we had to just throw all of our items back into the trolly. She wouldn’t even look at us just carried on scanning our items. We had bags already out in the trolly. I’ve never experienced such a rude woman, no one around us had to do this, only us. We then had to throw it all into the trolly again, crushing our items as she wasn’t giving us any time and then put them in our bags out by the car! Honestly Aldi I’m gutted because I love shopping with you. But I can’t do rude staff, a lot of us work in retail and no one I know speaks to customers like that. Rude",0,2

Aldi UK,Rude confrontational checkout staff,"Usual visit to Aldi, Histon Rd, Cambridge today, though sadly confronted with rude staff at checkout.

I asked him to give me a minute, to which I was told I was no longer to be served and could talk to a manager! I asked him to just carry on with his job so I could just leave.

Aldi UK,"Nuts out, messy floor, bad chicken :/","Well yikes, what a disaster my first visit here was. Initially, dirty floor with slippery bits all over with no signs after big rains. big hazard that. also rotting fruit and veg on display but not all of it thankfully. lazy staff who do not want to help me at all when i asked where the Frikadillan buggers are I got looked at like I was a murderer and laughed at. Nuts out, thought they were empty shells but no still had the nuts in also 2 bags open by the floor. That's me then..further into my shop, the chicken I picked up did not look healthy at all, looked a bit off and the pack has swelled, a big swell too with lots of juices in there. Any more it would have exploded out and created quite a mess for any unsuspecting customer. Imagine!I knew it was not right so alerted some staff girl who was loitering on her phone who got the manager who came over after about 10 minutes. He came across straight away as arrogant and rude and as if I was in the wrong and asked me without any introduction ''so whats the problem then, we make sure its all checked etc etc..''i told him he was rude and he said his name is Sam and if I want to complain i can and I wouldn't get very far??! I was showing him the chicken at this point and he snatched it out my hand and walked off in a temper. Shocked and alarmed, I put down my shopping where it was and left and told him very politely I would not be back in this mess of a place as he continued to walk off. The worst part is, its a new store, I even shouted that to him and he ignored me. oh well?? very aggravating indeed. But I'm a chilled guy so walked out. Don't do childish.

Aldi UK,Aldi chicken!!!,"Have been shopping in Aldi for a few years now. For sometime now I've been disappointed with the large packs of chicken breasts. I have 2 teenage kids who eat as much as myself & as portion sizes have increased, I need more from my pack. Firstly, the chicken doesn't smell fresh so I freeze it on day 1. Secondly, I use 3 breasts & end up with a lot of wastage from fat that's left on the chicken, & a layer of skin that's on the top. Then when I cook it, there's a lot of watery liquid that I end up having to drain away. When I'm finally eating the food I've cooked, I often have to throw away 'hard' bits of chicken that are tough & not nice to eat. You could say I'm really disappointed with the chicken I buy in the bigger pack, I will definitely not buy it again.",0,1

Still waiting for the outcome of my interview, as I've been told they will contact me by the end of week. It was 2 weeks ago and still not heard from them.

Aldi UK,Parking fines at Aldi,Just had a letter from Aldi's car parking company informing me that I have a £70 pound parking fine. I find it infuriating that shoppers using Aldi car parks can be fined for exceeding a time limit when shopping.My wife is disabled and takes time to get around the store and has occasionally returned to the car to sit and rest while I continue with some of the shopping. I was unaware of the 90 minute limit and on this occasion exceeded it. I know it seems to be Aldi's policy to conduct business at speed to keep costs down but it is often not a pleasant experience for the shopper who keeps Aldi in business and a £70 fine doesn't help the customers shopping bills.,0,1

I did so on two occasions and highlighted the very poor delivery company that Aldi use. Both my reviews did not meet with their criteria. No abusive wording was used, in fact I gave them 3 out of 5 *. I merely highlighted the poor delivery. Aldi does not like constructive criticism, so they wont publish it on their own review site. Like most people during the pandemic I have bought more things online. The biggest failing by far has been related to poor delivery. Why do companies not take this on board when you complain.",0,2

I asked to speak to the Manager who arrived after the lady had been served and said oh well its too late now ! absolute joke in customer service whatsoever or from the store manager in Hull. will not be going there again if its a free for all and you don't have to queue. I complained to head office and they said we will speak to the Manger of that store (waste of time)",0,1

Aldi UK,Promises for a refund that never appears,"I ordered a garden gazebo in June, which unfortunately was never delivered. Since then (it is now the end of October) I have made many calls to customer services to obtain a refund. They always promise the refund will go through, but it never does - lastest ‘story’ is that it will be in my bank by 5th November. This is the 4th date I’ve been given. To make matters worse this morning they have a problem with their phone system so it took 4 calls as I kept being cut off. Very poor service.",0,1

Aldi UK,"Rude, humiliating staff who lack customer service skills","ALDI SHEERNESS. Regularly shop at Aldi Sheerness, but never again.Over the past few months this store has deteriorated in service, stock and quality. But most concerning is the lack of some staff adherence to covid regulations.Shopped there recently, the aisles were part blocked by cages and trolleys of produce waiting to go out. A female member of staff was coughing constantly by the bread shelfs and had no mask on nor used her hand or arm to cover her mouth!! Very concerned we moved on, only to be shouted at by the staff member -that its not covid she had a chest infection and you cant catch a chest infection!! Stunning rude outburst and totally incorrect information by her. A simple search on internet indicates actions people should take to avoid passing on a chest infection and she took none of them. She has probably passed on her illness to many people!! Ignorant employee.Added to that 50% off staff either had no mask on, or had it round their chin!!At the till we had to wait 3 minutes while the cashier went off to chat/ argue with 3 other staff (one appeared to possibly be a manager of some sort), before returning and scanning our items with no apology.We wont return to Aldi, putting profit before customer or colleague safety is vile as was the staff member with a chest infection.",0,1

Aldi UK,Home Delivery experience,"I placed an on-line order on the 08.10.2020. The money was taken from my account. Come the 23.10.2020 No delivery. I rang Aldi to find out where the products were? The lady at the end of the line had an attitude problem from the moment she answered the line. I told here the story where she informed me that it was delivered on the 13.10.2020. I informed her that I had not received the items. She advised me to check the bins and under the car. I had to laugh at her, as the bins had been moved. My Husband uses the car everyday. I asked for proof of delivery i.e. a signature? or a photo as some drivers take photo's. To see if a neighbour had signed for it. Or it was delivered elsewhere. She could not answer that one. As far as the member of staff was concerned tough your problem, but as a good will gesture she will look into it. But from the attitude of that person. I take that as a cheque's in the post answer to get me of the line. Will not be using Aldi's on-line delivery service again.",0,1
Aldi UK,Humiliated,"Loved Aldi. Spent about £7k a year with home and work products. I have 3 medical conditions all hidden. They appear to have put harsh targets on staff so they cannot cope and make you feel you as a customer are too slow and should not shop there if you have a disability. I was left humiliated at the check out. Called customer service and no phone call back to date. Was left in tears. Spoke to store manager who said the prices are kept low because the services we provide and he had a hidden disability, so was it OK for me to be in tears by Aldi target and by Aldi staff? Apparently the reason they are cheap its because of how much speed you have to have on the floor and checkouts and all about the targets and customers must like it unless we change the prices. Going back to Tesco and Sainsburys, would rather pay more than put up with this and being humiliated at the tills with every one looking. One customer commented to me that was awful and he felt for me. So there you have it. I cannot help having a problem in spine. Thanks Aldi, for that customer journey. Adios.",0,1

Aldi UK,Whats going on with my favourite Glossop store,"Our grocery shopping was always with Tesco then they started with having to buy two in order to get one at a reasonable price and later having to buy three, on top of that a jar of source mix would be £1 one week and then £1.70 next week so the selling tactics were price confusion. That was 6 years ago, then we started shopping with Aldi and it was great the same products were on the shelves at the same price every week and we made an average saving of £20 a week and it was like that up to 12 months ago then the Aldi products started to change, a lot of the things we like have been substituted and every substitution has resulted in drop in quality this has been very disappointing and we have started using Tesco again because if you stick to the Tesco branded products the pricing is very similar to Aldi and most of the time better quality. Some examples of product change….1. Mayo Fing quality green tea has not been on the shelves in months only the cheap brand green tea is available so for this reason I now have to shop at Tesco.2. The Kitchen Creations soups which were the best soups I have ever had out of a can have been replaced with Bramwells which are o.k but not as good.3. The range of chocolate bars have changed I can no longer buy the Rum & Raisin bars.4. The Large extra Strong Tissues in a black box have been substituted for an inferior product although in a very similar box.5. The Large natural Yoghurts used to have a perspex lid so they can be resealed if not all used at once, so now we buy these yoghurts from Tesco and save the lids for when we do an Aldi shop.6. The six pack fruited yoghurts seem to have gone off the shelf and only the Active yoghurts are available that are more expensive, so once again back to Tesco.7. ""and the list goes on""These complaints may seem a bit trivial but is enough to make Tesco a better option, it also seems the staff are not as happy as they used to be so perhaps they are under some sort of pressure.My message to Aldi management is don't ruin a good thing in order to save a few bob.",0,3
Aldi UK,Will never ever order anything from…,"Will never ever order anything from Aldi again. It was 7 days before I got an Email to say order is being dispatched, which I accepted. I got an email from Hermes saying the order was out for delivery between 1300 - 1500 that day , then an email to say courier attempted but there was no one in and no safe place for the parcel. I was on and what’s more work from hone with my desk next to the window and front door. No one knocked or left a card. This then happened a further 4 times! I spoke to Aldi customer services to tell them no one had come to my door on any of the attempts and I could prove it as I have CCTV cameras.After the 5th attempt Hermes said they are sending it back to Aldi. It is now 11 days after I placed my order and I have tried 4 Aldi stores and can not get any of the products I ordered on lines. I rang Aldi to be told my refund would take a further 14 days to be processed. I have wasted nearly a month with Aldi and have not received my order. If they are going to use a courier service at least use one that delivers and does not lie. Maybe their couriers are on commission! I do think Aldi should take on some of the responsibilities as the service they use did not deliver. It as put me , my friends and neighbours off from ever ordering anything with Aldi again.",0,1
Aldi UK,Discrimination and Humiliation,"I’ve been shopping at Aldi for 2 years now, during Covid I’ve been shopping for my family and two others. Never a problem and I’ve always talked positively about the brand. Two weeks ago I did one of my 3 substantial shops at their Burscough store and was completely humiliated at the check out. The shop came to £109 and got out the cash to pay and counted it out, the till operator watched me do that and then said “we prefer you to use a card”, I said that I was doing someone else’s shop and he just said “we prefer card” and tapped the card machine. I said I was doing the shop for another family and they gave me cash, he just said AGIAN “we prefer card”. I stated that I shop there multiple times each week and never had a problem before. He responded “we make announcements throughout the store saying we prefer you to pay card”. During all this he’s refusing to accept the cash and people in the queue are watching and listening. I said that I didn’t think I had enough on my card but again he just tapped the card terminal. It was a horrible stressful situation that made me feel awful and that I was doing something wrong. Eventually I paid by card and the employee plainly ignored me, I’d had no eye contact from him the whole time. I went to pack my bags on the shelf and he starts a conversation with the next women about me and how disrespectful and dangerous it was I was paying cash. Completely humiliating. In hindsight I should of left. I called customer services the next day but was just fobbed off. Why didn’t Aldi take this seriously and at least apologise? I now shop at Tesco, how many more people will suffer the same discrimination ans do the same. Aldi, you need to improve your customer service both during and after an issue.",0,1
Aldi UK,Absolutely shocking service.,"Absolutely shocking service! Amazing everyday has to be a joke! Ordered a large delivery item online. Got an email from Aldi to say it was dispatched, then an email from XPD to say Aldi hadn't dispatched it. After numerous phone calls Aldi clearly had no idea where the item was, whether it was dispatched or not or when it would be delivered so I cancelled the ordered and expected a refund. A few days later got an email from the courier company to say it had now been collected from Aldi so I phoned again to check the cancellation had gone through and told it had and item would be returned to the warehouse. Then got an email the following day to say the item was out for delivery so I rang again and was told the other operators hadn't ""pushed the button"" on the cancellation and was told to reject he delivery. Did that and now still waiting for a refund as apparently Aldi have yet to receive the item back from the delivery company 9 days after order was rejected. No contact details available for XPD so can't contact them and Aldi don't seem too keen to contact them either. Aldi have told me they can't do anything for 14 days so I should ring back in 2 weeks and they'll see what's happening. They've got my money and my item and are seem more than happy to constantly lie to me to keep both. No doubt they'll try and deduct the delivery cost and charge a return fee even though I cancelled the order before it had even been dispatched. Avoid like the plague unless you want to be out of pocket and without your item.",0,1

As for the sponge, whoever made that needs to see a doctor because I really don't think they are well, physically or mentally.Who do you use to test food before you mass produce it? Have you checked what medication they are on?

Within a couple of minutes the 'safety message' is played over the tannoy....hand face space, Aldi are making sure that we are all safe etc. etc (something along those lines). When they finished their conversation, the cashier apologised for the delay. I mentioned that considering the message that was just announced, the manager too close to me and more importantly talking over my head. Her response was that he was wearing a face covering. I reminded her that his face covering was under his mouth and she retorted 'we are all going to catch it anyway'. My final response was that she is allowed to have her opinion however when it puts me at risk then my opinion is the mostrelevant.

I gave a disability in which I can't pack or even put goods back in my trolley at 100mph. They have not once told me to hurry up, not once huffed and puffed or been ryde or arrogant in any way. They have always let me know how much the total is either straight away or if I have asked, without ignoring me (I struggle to read the total on screens).

She was having a go at the customer in front not placing the payment card correctly on the machine so I knew it wasn't personal to us just not very nice but didnt expect this .

Aldi UK,Absolutely shocking delivery,"Absolutely shocking delivery. I’ve been waiting for my order of 4 items which should have been delivered on Thursday (It’s now Saturday). The order had been split into 2 deliveries, one being delivered by Yodel and one by Hermes. Neither company has managed to deliver their items, with both ‘attempting’ a delivery on two occasions. Both times I have had messages saying they couldn’t find my address, or I wasn’t in (I was) or that I turned the delivery away on the doorstep (all lies!). This is not the first time we’ve had problems getting Yodel and Hermes to deliver things - they are a complete joke around our village as no one gets a delivery at the first attempt. Why does Aldi use such rubbish delivery agents? I have also rung Aldi customer services but apparently until I have waited SIX DAYS from the last tracking notification I cannot cancel my order and apply for a refund or even arrange a redelivery to a store, as it is not deemed ‘lost’! This is a total nonsense, and extremely frustrating as a customer. I am so fed up as I currently have no idea where my order is or how I can get hold of it. What is even more frustrating is the products I ordered are now in my local store where I could easily go and buy them!

Aldi UK,Garden line Gazebo,"Garden line GazeboPurchased 6 months ago online for £99.99.Waited several weeks for delivery.Finally arrived and built up looked ok.However few months in metal work showed signs if rust and on closer inspection all the joins that had been poorly wielded had failed.Bearing in mind it's a two man job to build up and there is a quite a few ride and poles making up the roof section so you would expect fairly tested product which somebody at Aldi resourcing department had the mentality of issuing a 3 year warranty / guarantee.After weeks forward and backwards with Service J.G. Schütte Nonfood GmbH & Co. KGBased in Germany, I am now left with £100 piece if scrap.Also head office and distribution centre AKA ""head office"" have customer service skills of chimps at the Zoo.I was asked ""why I have no printer to print off return tickets"" and I replied"" I have no reason for a printer"" and usually a company selling such items should be more involved with resolving issues.Also told to expect to wait 6-8 weeks for refund of money paid.Looking outside we have several Gardenline furniture from Aldi and to be honest I would strongly suggest against buying any more from then again.My thoughts are that strong I will also refrain shopping at any Aldi store ever again.",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi Hinckley,"Aldi Hinckley. Been a regular customer since this branch opened but recently the tannoy announcements have started talking over each other and are so frequent that my partner and I cannot communicate whilst in the store. This inability to communicate is causing such frustration that we feel we can no longer shop in your store, this issue aside, we shopped at Hinckley this morning only to find that most of the aisles have been blocked with pallets of Halloween treats (here we go again #frustration....) people trying to get past, people getting frustrated because they can't get past..... when will you learn Aldi? Pissing your customers off does not earn loyalty, all it gets you is more poor reviews. Please do something about your annoying tannoy announcements and please stop blocking your aisles.",0,2
Aldi UK,Great variety & great prices,"Have been a regular ALDI customer for some time now, and am always impressed with their prices, the service and their ever expanding range, particularly of vegan options. After seeing yet more affordable, plant-based products on my most recent trip I was prompted to write a review to congratulate ALDI for providing a variety you don’t find every day in supermarkets, especially not at such good prices. From the basics to the more obscure items, ALDI is always my first choice when shopping. My local store (Coulby Newham Middlesbrough) has always offered great service, never had any issues with returns or products there, friendly staff, hence the five star rating. Keep up the great work Aldi 👍🏼",0,5

I returned the tvs on the 17th and they claimed a bank holiday maybe the reason the refund is not made yet. Please let me know what bank holiday is in September the last bank holiday was August 31, 2020. Still waiting on my refund it's now October 5, 2020.Aldi Customer Services is appalling.

Aldi UK,Bad service and poor value,"Aldi for years has been my weekly shop.Even with its ridiculous army drill style shopping being pushed through to you so fast, it's still been reasonable quality and value. That is until recently....Aldi have now lost this family as customers, spending on average about 90-100 per week, which incidentally has gone up and up recently. So no longer good value at all. The reason is, poor quality items, items past their use by date, abrupt rude staff, and the nonsense with closing one checkout, so you go to another, but as soon as your beginning to load up the checkout, the one that closed gets reopened. Apparently this is so staff aren't idle for more than 1minute!? Are they so tight and miserly that 1 minute of staff time counts so much. By doing this, it has the knock on effect of having more customers waiting to be served and therefor more risk due to congestion in aisles Also being told to pack your bags at your car is a complete no no!!! If we are good enough to give Aldi our custom, then they should give us the respect of being able to pack inside, or at a checkout. Every other supermarket does this. Aldi has gone from a great chain, so one of the worst and for that reason, I will absolutely never go back.I hope Aldi management read this and take notice. As the way your treating customers is nuts. You deserve to be shut down. For me, Lidl all the way. You could learn a thing or two from them. Quality and value are tremendous.",0,1

Our major 'crime' on the previous visit was buying some salmon and veg, When I asked to see the manager, the young girl said there wouldn't be anyone in charge until Sunday.

Aldi UK,Quality at an amazing price.,"I always used to think I wouldn't ever shop there. But then one opened on my doorstep so I ventured in. The range is very limited, but because their turnover is so high, the freshness is unbeatable. And the quality is surprisingly good - their meat and fish are astounding. The veg is a bit more patchy - onions are often off, apples bashed too often. So you need to be a bit more careful. But the prices swing a 5 star reviews. It's unbeatable. And do the odd online for things you can't get there.",0,5
Aldi UK,UPDATE Aldi will not publish negative reviews,"Aldi will not publish honest, accurate negative product reviews.

The arrived with every one having broken glass bits inside the plastic globe. The glass was from broken and rather fragile filament mounts. I wrote this in my review and stated disappointment in Aldi telling me my refund would take 14 days from receipt of the returned light bulbs.Here is Aldi's response to my honest, accurate rating:+++++Your review for Giant Antique Globe Light Bulb cannot be made live Hi,Thank you for submitting a review.Unfortunately, your review didn't meet with our guidelines and as a result we're unable to publish it.Please check our review guidelines and full terms and conditions - these will give you helpful advice on what to avoid when submitting a review.If you would like to leave another review, just click the link below.Add a new review nowThanks again,The Aldi Reviews Team+++++I am hugely disappointed in this soft of treatment from Aldi. How can a major retailer do this sort of thing and get away with it?UPDATEI revised my review to five stars and praised the product design. But I left in my comment to the effect that waiting 14 days for a refund, after Aldi receives return of a defective product, is disappointing and not best practice.Would you believe -- Aldi again said my review was ""moderated"" and could not be published.Net, net -- it is clear that Aldi reviews do not show the true picture to consumers. This is nothing short of fraudulent.I then phoned Aldi Customer Service.

Aldi UK,Cheap Supermarket ... Even Cheaper Service?,"Oh dear! The CURSE OF THE DISCOUNT SUPERMARKET STRIKES AGAIN!Check out my other LIDL review, and NEVER shop at LIDL! ""Big On Quality, Lidl On Manners""A new ALDI STORE recently opened near to my home on Aldcliffe Road in LANCASTER. Money tight, and having shopped at Sainsbury's for about 13 years, I eagerly switched!I've shopped at the new Aldi for just weeks, and yet I have SERIOUS CONCERNS about Aldi's management of the store, staff hygiene, and multiple dubious business practices!Firstly, unlike Sainsbury's there is no effective STORE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. The ""Traffic Light"" system is stuck on green. People just crowd in, with the store, in my opinion, TOO CROWDED!Secondly, recently I was checking out, and just before he served me, the male checkout operator on Till Number 1, produced a tissue and COUGHED and SNEEZED into it. He touched his face multiple times. He hastily applied a smidgen of hand sanitiser, then touched all my shopping! Hand sanitiser will NOT remove MUCUS and BODILY FLUIDS! He told the woman in front of me he had HAYFEVER for the first time ever! This was the most DISGUSTING thing I've ever witnessed in food shopping! And in the middle of a CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC too! My sister visited the store that same day, and said the checkout operator was COUGHING and SNEEZING!Thirdly, on my last visit, I almost purchased COOKED MEAT with a red ""30% Off"" sticker, and with an EXPIRED ""USE BY"" DATE. This is ILLEGAL! I don't know about ""Aldi"", the cooked meat was more like ""Mouldy""!Fourthly, also on my last visit, I purchased a pack of REDUCED cheese rolls with a red ""30% Off"" sticker. Unlike Sainsbury's who REPLACE the original full price barcode, Aldi rely on staff to manually add the discount at the till. I was charged FULL PRICE for almost expired cheese rolls! And had I bought the aforementioned reduced and expired cooked meat, you can bet your bottom dollar the lazy check out assistant would have charged me FULL PRICE!The moral of the story? Yes Aldi are cheap, if NOT EXPIRED the quality of the food is good, but they are clearly NOT TO BE TRUSTED! Check dates on EVERYTHING you buy! Check that discounts are correctly applied! And if you feel the store is TOO CROWDED in the pandemic, let Aldi know.I complained about the issues I've detailed here to ALDI and ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. Aldi's reply was a ""fob off""! I don't believe they've done ANYTHING about the issues I reported. Environmental Health haven't even bothered to reply!#AldiEverydayAnnoyingRemember, my advice is DON'T trust Aldi. In my view, all they're interested in is your MONEY! Cheap supermarket, even cheaper service!ONE STAR!EDIT: I see other people are BUYING EXPIRED MEAT, even OLDER than the meat I almost bought! And other people are also criticising Aldi's COVID COMPLIANCE, with customers not wearing masks and stores too crowded. Also rude Aldi staff (like LIDL). Like I said, watch Aldi like a HAWK, and DON'T TRUST THEM! If Aldi treat customers badly, they needn't be surprised if they get bad reviews!",0,1

A shame as before all the big tv advertising that Aldi now do their products where good quality and fairly priced. Much as I hate Tescos I'm now finding Tescos much better. Why pay three quarters of the price of the leading brands at Aldi for now inferior Aldi branded products which are often awful when you can pay tip top full price at Tescos for leading brands that are consistent in quality.Ps anyone thinking of giving it to their dog I beg you please put it in the bin as their is a high risk it will contain bones that will get stuck in your dogs throat.,0,1

Aldi UK,After messaging Aldi customer services…,"After messaging Aldi customer services around two weeks ago in regards to a shortage of double toddler trollies being available at the Middleton stores, I was pleasantly surprised to arrive at one of your stores yesterday to be greeted with a whole row of these trolleys. As little as this issue might have seemed, it really does make a difference to my (and I’m sure many others) shopping experience. I would just like to thank you for not only taking my email seriously but for also providing these trolleys as such a quick rate. It’s really appreciated.",0,5
Aldi UK,Nosediving.,"Was 'with' Aldi since they opened. The quality of brand name products was dropping and Aldi stuff was usually equal and often better. Now, Aldi are actually becoming the nasty cheap shop some people originally, and mistakenly, thought they were Their focus is on price and quality is nosediving. Fruit is often rotten before you get it home. Week by week, item by item, something in the shopping has become sh!t. Recently it's been the Red Leicester, dry cure bacon, and tiramisu. Odd things are exceptional value. I like the chocolate, she likes the jelly beans and the posh pork loin chops are very good.Where once, you might get most of your shopping at Aldi and go to the big supermarket for your coffee, tea and ketchup, now, there are only a few items worth getting at Aldi.PS I would have liked to defend the staff because, pre Covid, the regulars were canny, and directing the public in a firm yet polite way is an acquired skill, but they are just plain rude.",0,2

Aldi UK,Organised and pleasure to shop …,Aldi in whitefield was very good through the covid lock down. Trolleys were cleaned and it was well organised you felt safe to shop in the store. The store was very well stocked throughout the lock down and being disabled l felt l could shop without being knocked over like the bigger chains who just let anyone in. Strict adherence was given to shopping for ppl like myself and older customers. They were amazing as it seemed effortless taking the stress out of a very stressful time. lve always shopped in aldi and found that through this trying time they raised they bar where others failed appallingly. I didnt venture out much but felt safe fo shop as it was controlled very well,0,5
Aldi UK,Dont expect delivery within 5 working days,Ordered around £250 worth of wine on Saturday with delivery 'within 5 working days'. Received an email on Wednesday to say everything was on track. Called at around 2.45 Friday (TODAY) asking when i should expect the order as at the latest should have been due today. Emma at Customer care though it might arrive tomorrow but could not confirm. Apparently i should have read the T's and C's as it says delivery only estimated.... Every email I have says withing 5 working days. No actual explanation given for the delay. Very disappointing Aldi. Lets 'hope' that the delivery arrives tomorrow as if it doesn't I have to apparently take more of my time to call the customer care team to probably be told the same!,0,1

Huge rip down it.On opening there was no bubble wrap around anythung and all the glass items had smashed. The diffusers had leaked. Mermaid broken into bits.Cream destroyed.I sent pictures to customer services and was told I would need to return all the items. I questioned the broken glass as it could harm someone but was told I had to. I filled in form and packaged in new box. Then returned. Tracking shows recieved over 2 weeks ago and everytime I contact customer service I am given some excuse and told I will recieve refund any day.Not good enough. Im now over £50 down. In uncertain times when money is hard to come by I am waiting for my money through no fault of my own because you send items not fit for purpose.The items were smashed to bits and soaked.The diffusers had leaked.Boxes destroyed and creams smashed.You need to learn staff to pack properly.Not acceptable and I'm now taking it to trading standards.

It was clear that they were packaged to be as appealing as a thigh, a breast or a leg - but in reality it was more bone and skin than anything edible.

I was told by one adviser from Customer service that the item will be reordered to arrive 1st class on a Monday, when nothing arrived I contacted them again I was then told that the last adviser did not leave any notes on thesystem that I even called.The item was not reordered. This went on until I asked for a refund. The item was still at the previous address. I then asked if they can collect the item and was told Hermes tried but said they couldn't collect after two attempts. The tenant from the previous address can throw the item away. Appalling with no customer care focus. I'm so put off I will never order from Aldi online again",0,1

Aldi UK,No responsibility for customers welfare,I visited an Aldi store yesterday - both hand sanitizers were empty and I saw at least two people walking round the shop without facemasks who managed to pass by all Aldi staff and checkout without anyone challenging them - and this was in Preston an area under local lockdown. Clearly Aldi put profits before any thought of protecting customers.,0,1

When I took them back to Aldi, Zion Place, Margate, the Manager denied he was the Manager. To say the store was uninterested in selling out of date produce is an under statement!!

I mentioned that I thought that the store (not the member of staff) should empty bins more often. I was told I could complain if I wanted. As the rate is cases is rising rapidly in Wirral this concerns me but not the assistant who said it didn't bother him and that he had been working all day.

Aldi UK,"Aldi - New Basford, Nottingham","Aldi - New Basford, Nottingham. If you want to be screamed at and humiliated by the staff who have no consideration for social distancing then this is the place for you. Having shopped there since it opened the staff have up to now been wonderful. Today, the checkout girl had it in for me from the moment I put down my first item. She told me to take it down as she didn’t want it on her conveyor belt. Which I did. Having finished placing the rest of the items down the checkout girl then told the customer behind who only had a couple of items me to squeeze past me as she wanted to serve her first. With no social distancing the customer did as she was told. Then it was my turn. I obviously wasn’t placing my items back into the trolley at a fast enough pace to please her so she then started pushing them in. At that point I quietly spoke to her asking her not to push them in. Well, at that point all hell broke loose! She started screaming and shouting at me that I was being rude. I explained to her quietly that this was embarrassing and I might just need to walk away to avoid the onslaught of verbal abuse. To which she replied that it was my choice, it didn’t bother her as she would get somebody else to put the shopping away. I carried on loading my trolley and paid . When I took my receipt off her she then started screaming and shouting again that I was being rude . All this was happening in front of other customers who just stood there shocked by her behaviour. Finally, I said please could I speak to the manager - to which she shouted, “I AM THE MANAGER!” When we, the customers, speak to people we are rightfully asked to be respectful and polite. Surely the same should be asked of the staff at Aldi.",0,1

I have been self isolating for 5 months and as I live alone I have had to shop for food which I have done at Aldi Biggleswade.I just went in today for a browse ( as getting back etc) and having spent approx £50 I queued as usual. The man in front went to till just as it closed I waited until it was safe to move forward as I was about to go forward a woman jumped in. I reminded her there was a queue when an Aldi employee came from behind me stating that wasn’t true that there was one line.

Then demanded we showed ID for sugar free redbull... 😂 there were no signs and we weren’t told anything, just wish your staff were polite and had communication skills. Your staff are so rude, even when I went to the Aldi in Aylesbury I got the same, just have 0 customer service skills... If you hate your job quit, don’t take the hatred of your job out on customers... ruining people’s day for no reason at all?ALSO why on earth do your staff scan the items so quickly, to the point where you’re literally frantically trying to shove everything into a bag? I mean it’s ridiculous... One woman just hurling the groceries at me, has the cheek to ask “cash or card”, I just said “look if you give me a chance love” 🙄",0,2

Aldi UK,High Wycombe (Tannery Rd) branch - unpleasant staff,"Have always shopped mainly at Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s all my life. First time in my life recently I thought I would try Aldi as I’d heard about their reasonable prices. Have been to the High Wycombe (Tannery Rd) branch now 5 times recently. Sad to say but found the checkout staff and the shop floor staff there very rude and dictatorial and unprofessional with a nonchalant and arrogant attitude that does not focus on the customer at all i.e. the person who pays their salaries! I was TOLD and spoken to rudely and aggressively by the checkout staff to queue at a different checkout even though she had just about finished serving the customer in front of me and was not closing and could have quite easily attended to me next. It was clear that this was due to laziness and she wanted to do as little work as possible. Her unacceptable and hostile tone was unnecessary.Was not greeted at all on coming to the checkout or when leaving after paying. How difficult or painful could it be for a person to say a simple hello or bye?! Yes, we all get off days when our mood can be low but this was a regular occurrence experienced by me and observed by me happening to other customers. This is not something that requires special training as a greeting should be a natural and “human thing” to do.There was no smile or acknowledgement of my approaching the checkout nor during the scanning process. Again, this was observed to be happening to others too and is something that does not make the customer feel welcome as after all, we are giving you our hard-earned money. The customer is paying your salaries! When being served and mid-scanning, the checkout staff was holding a full-blown conversation with another colleague on a different checkout. Very rude. Very unprofessional. Making the customer feel worthless and ignored. It seems ironic to give you our hard-earned money whilst being ignored and not acknowledged at the same time!The checkout staff was scanning my items faster than I could put them in the trolley. When I asked him to slow it down a little, he said he could not do this as Aldi had some kind of a monitoring mechanism installed in the tills that showed the speed rate of their scanning and that if they scanned it slower, they could get into trouble. Charming! Well, that doesn’t help the customer when the items are almost being lunged at them and falling off the little space available at the checkout.I observed a checkout staff DICTATING to a customer (of a foreign nationality) to “get back and stand on the line!” i.e. when she had inadvertently not observed social-distancing. There was no need for this female staff member to adopt this “British bulldog” attitude as she blatantly felt she could as the other customer’s grasp of the English language was not so good. When I asked a shop floor staff for assistance of where certain items were kept, she just pointed her finger towards the aisle, looked at me patronisingly as if to suggest I should know where things are kept and walked off ! A little courtesy in the manner of speaking and/or actually walking to the appropriate aisle to show me would not have gone amiss. Other stores such as Tesco’s, Sainsbury’s, Marks and Spencer and Waitrose do this. It’s hardly rocket science. There is a “racist demeanour” present in much of the staff here in this store which is off-putting and in time, will be detrimental to the company to employ such staff.I am not sure what vetting criteria Aldi use (if any) when interviewing people but evidently it is not stringent enough to ascertain the “true nature or disposition” of the potential employee they are interviewing. It is all very well for companies to be putting up signs saying that “bullying of staff (by customers) will not be tolerated”; Aldi needs to have a sign stating that CUSTOMERS too will not tolerate bullying by the staff!Well, goodbye Aldi, I shan’t be visiting any of your stores anymore. The cheaper goods you supply are not worth the insults and humiliation and aggression that your staff dish out! Apologies for the long review but felt it crucial to give feedback for the benefit of the company as Directors/Senior Mgmt can be so far removed from the ""shop floor"" to know what's truly happening in the stores. Thank you.",0,1

Aldi UK,Dear customer services,"Dear customer servicesI have been going to Aldi Enfield in Crown Rd for over 6 years. On the 27.8.20 around 4.10 pm was shopping as normal when I was approached by 2 men in the store. They told me to leave immediately. I asked why and was told I had been banned for shoplifting?? I explained that they must have the wrong person and wanted to see the store manager. He said that he is the store manager and grabbed me in front of other customers and started to push me. It caused me a lot of pain as I have shoulder injury. I didn’t resist and said I would phone the police. Once I got outside I called the police and waited for 1 hour and 10 minutes for them to arrive. When they arrived I explained what had happened and the police said have they got any proof? We went inside and went to a room. The manager who's name is ****** said that he HAD NOT seen me shoplift but there was a girl called ****** who did. ****** was called into the room and asked to give her version of the story. She said that during lockdown she approached a man on his way out of the store and asked what was in his bag, the man ran off. This man was supposed to be me? Since lockdown I have been to this store at least 30 times spending £70-£100 a week , I have bank statements to prove this. ****** is always there and has always seen me. Why all of a sudden have I become a thief ? I am a law abiding citizen and have never stolen anything in my life or been in trouble with the police. The area manager came in after and told me I was now banned for life. I am so upset as it's clearly a case of mistaken identity. If you check the cctv you will see the way I was treated bearing in mind the is no evidence of something that happened 5 months ago. How can I be banned for something I didn’t do? I don’t want to take this any further. All I want is the ban lifted and my name cleared. I am not a thief and never have been. I’m hoping you can help as no one in the store wanted to listen. Disgusting behaviour from disgusting people. Will be seeking legal advise",0,1

This is the 4th time in a row that I have had to ring customer services to chase a missing wine order and each time they fob you off by asking you to give it a few more days and call back. I pointed out that each time there is a problem it is relating to a wine delivery and not other products ordered, there is clearly a problem with the dispatch of wine from their warehouse but I was told that there is not a facility to make a complaint online about any problems. Hence, I am posting this on Trip Advisor and warning other potential shoppers not to purchase wine online from Aldi unless you are not very thirsty and are happy to wait as long as it takes Aldi to ""get their finger out"".I would add that once the wine eventually leaves Aldi warehouse that the carrier delivers in an acceptable timeframe.",0,1

Aldi UK,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. I have bought quite a number of tools from Aldi and they are excellent. Hence, had no hesitation to buy a folding bike (£299). When received the bike was faulty - the frame was out of alignment. Over a few days and two phone calls the service dept finally got details right to arrange collection. I really wanted a replacement rather than a refund as the bike was fundamentally good. I was told there was no stock left and a pick up day was arranged for a refund. In the meantime the next week's newsletter still had the bike on offer and I checked there was stock. I didn't want to order another one to make me £600 in the system so phoned to see if I could get a replacement as they were available again. Was told I could have a replacement but only when the faulty one was collected and returned to the warehouse. I would then be put on a first come first served basis to receive a replacement - if stocks were still available at that time as ""they can't reserve items"". What a ridiculous process. I doubt if Aldi ever read these reviews but beware if you actually want a particular, expensive item from them and it is faulty.",0,1

Aldi UK,Don't use Aldi New Malden's cash machine unless you want your card retained in machine!,"Aldi, New Malden WARNING RE THEIR CASH MACHINE AND APPALLING CUSTOMER CARE BY THEIR SO CALLED MANAGER, a couple of days ago went to store to get supplies. After collecting a trolley full of goods needed some cash and used their free in house ""cashZzone"" machine. Put my visa debit card in .... it took ages buzzing around doing nothing then I got a message ""because you have not removed your card in time it has been retained within machine"". Somewhat hard to remove card when it had not rejected it! Obviously concerned so I asked for the manager and waited a lifetime. The so called manager eventually arrived yet was most unhelpful and insisted there was nothing he could do and portrayed minimal concern to me the customer and walked off. He just blandly stated to ring the number on the machine stating this was not Aldi's problem! I rang about 3 times after option 1 failed to connect, I then insisted on talking to the manager again and became annoyed at his lack of care. At this stage he called for security to remove me from the store at which time I rang the number again. Eventually told by ""cashZzone"" that my card was now retained and I will not be able to recover but have to void card and get another debit card ordered. Other than the fact that I could not now purchase my shopping and the fact that when I attempted to ask the manager (I use the term loosely) to put a note on the machine to advise it not working properly/warn other customers of the issue he really was not at all interested. To state his management skills were zero is a massive under estimation. As such I now have to order another debit card and warn other Aldi New Malden customers to be aware, also expressing if you have issues this manager has a negative customer care focus. As such will never use this store again, so good marketing Aldi New Malden you have just lost a loyal customer because of your lack of customer care as highlighted by the so called manager, who obviously would benefit from lessons in customer care.",0,1
Aldi UK,Poorly structured and insufficiently managed interviews - area manager did not turn up on more than 2 occasions,"I read with interest this week about Aldi’s UK expansion plans for the rest of this year. 1,200 new staff and opening, on average, one new store a week until Christmas. By any measure this will be a very large scale undertaking and will place pressures on your recruitment operations. I imagine in the region of at least 3,500 people would need to be interviewed to fulfil 1,200 roles. I have contacted you to share my recent experience of the failure of your recruitment process in Liverpool when I was invited to attend your group assessment stage on two separate occasions which were both cancelled after I had turned up on the designated days because the Operations Manager did not turn up nor were his unexpected absences explained to the attendees.Because I am currently employed Monday-Friday I had chosen to attend on weekend dates in July. I took taxis on both occasions as the locations were not near my home, although the store I was applying for is, and I wanted to ensure that I would be on time and felt that public transport could not guarantee my punctuality on a weekend. On the first assessment date at Halewood in Liverpool all of my group had arrived by 1pm when the interview was due to start. We were told to go and wait in the canteen. I would like to point out here that nobody introduced themselves, did a quick run through of what to expect or sought to convey a friendly welcome. Not long after 1.30pm (when some of the next group started to arrive) somebody, who said he was a manager, appeared and said that unfortunately nobody had been able to contact the Operations Manager so we should go home and rebook our assessment stage of the recruitment process. I assumed from that it was the Operations Manager who was scheduled to conduct the assessments. After rebooking another date I turned up again later in the month at Aigburth in Liverpool. I was met by the same process ie instructed to wait in the canteen and no friendly welcome was offered. I mention this as I believe it is an area that Aldi can certainly improve on and should aim to do so. First impressions count for a lot and a company that can convey friendly professionalism will always leave candidates with a favourable impression whether they are subsequently successful or not. I am sure you realise that every candidate will discuss their recruitment experiences with their families and friends, some also post to social media sites to ensure that a wider audience will be aware of any negatives. At Aigburth a manager came into the canteen after about 20 minutes and said that the Operations Manager was not going to arrive. He said that the Operations Manager has told him that he had sent out an email earlier that day. The manager asked me to look on my emails for the email however my phone had died after mapping the route to get to the interview. I told him I last checked my emails at 12:30pm so if he had sent out an email it either did not include me or was sent after 12:30pm, which is shockingly late since the interview was due to start at 1:35pm and the distance I was expected to travel for the interview I would have already have had to leave my house. Later I checked and I had not received this email (because, obviously, I would not have turned up) . I explained nor have I received an explanation or apology since about why an Operations Manager who is due to conduct assessment stages for recruitment had failed to turn up on 2 occasions without any warning to the waiting staff and candidates. I am sure you can appreciate that the impact is entirely negative. On the first occasion I was prepared to accept that the Operations Manager must have been unavoidably detained somewhere else and there could be valid reasons whilst that might be so but I do not accept that the same person (or a colleague with the same job title and role) would be unavoidably detained on a second occasion during the same month. I do not understand why a manager at Halewood and later at Aigburth could not have undertaken the assessment stage activities. Surely it makes operational sense that Aldi would have a Plan B if a key person becomes unexpectedly unavailable during a process such as recruitment. The manager of my local store in Huyton obviously needed additional staff and that was why roles were advertised at his store but there is no possibility of those roles being filled when recruitment does not take place. That also puts extra pressure on the staff in the Huyton store when they have less colleagues than they need. I was told by other candidates that the same area manager had failed to turn up for their interviews forcing them to have to reschedule and waste their time. I would be humiliated to work for a company that follows the principle that the higher up a staff member is the more they can stamp on those 'below' them.",0,1
Aldi UK,Bad online experience,"I’m quite disappointed with my online experience as I have shopped a few times in store. I’ve currently moved into a new place and have seen a particular laundry basket from several retailers but Aldi has a cheaper price, so I decided to order the basket online. When I was ordering it was the only basked left so I quickly ordered it. I paid for it to be delivered to a store and collect it as I know I’m mainly working. The day after I ordered it, collect plus said they had received my item and where going to deliver it to a store and would contact me shortly. However, a few days later I still didn’t hear about my delivery and where about my item was. I decided to log into collect plus and track my item: unfortunately when I did I saw that my item failed to be delivered to the selected store and was being returned to Aldi. I managed to get through to Aldi customer service where I was told the item was unable to be delivered. No explanation was given as to why my parcel could not be delivered to a store that is open and was told that they could not despatch it again as the item is ‘out of stock’. I was then told I would have to wait until the beginning of September to receive a refund ... I’m absolutely appalled because I believe they never had the item in the first place and why would I need to wait that long for a refund when it takes seconds for money to be taken from my account. I hope I’m fully refunded for my delivery charge aswell as I feel that I’ve wasted my time and money. Will not be ordering from them again and do not advise others to ...it’s better to spend more and actually receive your parcel",0,1

Both too far from me to get to without 2 bus journeys What were they thinking of? Whoever did their research were not thinking about non car drivers. I missed the bus twice to go there and it took me over an hour to walk there, how stupid are they to put a new store so far out with limited access and difficult entrance for those that do drive. The person in charge of picking new sites did not do their homework and should be fired. The takings on that store will be well down guaranteed. They would have been better Building a store near me where we have ONLY got an Asda between 2 large council estates and a very large residential aria very busy ring road?

I organised a return straight away - the tv was to be collected from my home. The courier failed to arrive on two occasions so eventually I arranged to take it into the store and it would be collected from there. It was collected from the store on July 13th and I was told that I would have a full refund (£349) within 14 days. It has now been a month and, despite several requests and automated responses from Customer Services, I have still not received a refund.

I hardly used it last year. Earlier this month when I tried to use it , it packed down. I rang ALdi Customer services maintenance dept for help to repair or replacement or refund.

I said it was a small flimsy receipt which I could not find.However, I told them that I have had my Bank statement for the payment made to Aldi on that date for the same amount.

The ALDI AFTER SALES SUPPORT SERVICE , inspite of my repeated plea refused to accept the Bank statement record and Guarantee papers.For such a major International store name , this attitude of complete disregard to customer is very regrettable and unworthy of its name.Years go I went to return an used defective garment to Marks Spencer.

Weeks later still no sign of the rest of the package Aldi customer services advised the item was lost with the courier, which they could have told me in the first place instead of lying! Due to the lies I was left without a present for my little girls birthday, so thank you Aldi for ruining her birthdayWill never use Aldi online or food stores again",0,1

Aldi UK,Bulk buying,I think its awful how they allowed people to bulk buy and resell the inflatable kayaks they had - they should've had a one per customer rule!!!

Aldi UK,What is the point of buying lower cost fruit,"What is the point of buying lower cost fruit like strawberries, blueberries, raspberries if it's rotten to the core when removing the packaging the same day and CANNOT BE EATEN. This has happened so regularly I'm now done. I'd honestly rather pay a bit bit more and buy from Sainsbury's for fruit I can actually eat. It's not cost effective buying compost!",0,1
Aldi UK,Decent products but awful delivery experience.,"Aldi sent me an email asking for a review of my recent purchases. I was honest and said that the items were decent, however their delivery service and customer service was awful. The review was ""moderated"" and wasn't posted. There was no foul language and I was honest. So thought I'd post a review here. I ordered 3 items, one of which was in 2 packages, so 4 parcels in total. They delivered all 4 on 4 different occasions. One of which I rang up about not receiving only for them to tell me it was a 50/50 chance of it turning up. Not what you want to hear. So I allowed another 10 days before contacting their courier service, XDP. They told me it had been delivered. I argued the fact that it hadn't and they provided no proof to show it had been. A few emails later and they mysteriously sent a dispatch email for the missing package. Fair enough it was found and delivered late, but it took alot of chasing up and arguing to get what I'd paid for. It shouldn't be that difficult. XDP were rude and lied and Aldi's customer service was pretty much useless. And as unhelpful and uninformative as the Aldi guy on the phone was, at least he was polite.I like Also as a shop and I'll continue to shop in their stores, but I would never order online again unless they sort out their courier service. So was that review so bad Aldi? I don't think it was. Why not post it on your site? Just want the over the top good ones?",0,1
Aldi UK,Appalling and unprofessional experience…,"Appalling and unprofessional experience with Aldi's recruitment team.I was required to book a group assessment via email as part of the recruitment process. I did so and received a confirmation. On the day of my assessment, I arrived to the venue to be told by the store manager that due to a blip on the booking system, the system was sending confirmations to the candidates but not feeding this information back to Aldi. So there was no group assessment. He took my details and told me that somebody would get in touch with me to reschedule my assessment. This happened at the beginning of July, nobody has got in touch with me at all. I have sent several emails to the recruitment team but no answer from them either. I have tried to call them several times but the calls get disconnected. I have tried to complain using social media but their advise was to get in touch with the recruitment team. I managed to get through somebody using the customer service phone number but the email address I was provided with didn't accept emails for security or policy reasons. After all this, yesterday I received an email from Aldi telling me that on this occasion I haven't been successful with my application. What a joke!!! Extremely unprofessional and no respect for candidates is all I can say.",0,1
Aldi UK,Sunday 26th July 2020,"Sunday 26th July 2020, just returned from Aldi GORSEINON NR. SWANSEA. Well, after getting a few bits and pieces, we started to queue at the checkout, only for an ignorant male employee to shout that we had to go back around and join a queue of customers with full trolleys, we had 2 packs of frozen chips, 1 chilled chicken pie (reduced) and 2 steak pies (also reduced) which to add insult to injury, the guy on the checkout (not the ignorant one who shouted) pointed out that he'd put the 3 pies through at full price and then consequently reduced them, but when we checked the receipt, only 2 pies were reduced. So all in all, not impressed, and why are the staff pulling pallets loaded with goods through the store at peak times? Someone will get hurt one day. It was organised Chaos!!!!

Aldi UK,I love aldi food and prices but…,"I love aldi food and prices but everything has its cost and in Aldi you pay through accepting the most appalling customer service. Some staff are unbelievably rude, others do their best. The packing area has always been stressful but now that aldi are enforcing their no packing rules (under the guise that this protects their workers) it has become unbearable. I always put heavy items on the conveyer belt first so they go in my trolley bags first. Now you have your bags forcibly removed from your trolley and you are forced to use the awful 'packing shelf'. There are crowds of people at this point so it is not socially distanced. If you are doing a big shop you will easily fill half of that shelf on your own. I could hardly breathe with my mask and just wanted to get out. At no point did I feel like a paying customer. It took three times as long as usual which surely means the shop has more customers in at any point than normal.",0,1

Aldi UK,Brought some flowers in Aldi Stafford…,"Brought some flowers in Aldi Stafford the other day, served by a young blonde haired lady who wasn't best pleased with the two elderly customers who were packing their products at the till. We all should be a little more patient with our elderly customers as we'll be in the same position one day. When the young lady came to serve myself she was obviously fed up and couldn't scan my two lots of flowers which seemed to upset her more which resulted in her slamming the fragile flowers down on the counter. I was shocked and annoyed, and couldn't believe her actions considering I'm just about to pay for these items. I came away not saying anything as I wasn't very happy, so I brought this disgracefull behavior to the online survey which they promote and ask for shoppers opinions. I had a standard email response saying they would let the Stafford store manager know as this was not exceptable. I've waited for the Stafford store manager to get in touch believing they would say sorry for their staffs behavior and that they've spoken to the young lady so that this doesn't happen again.Unfortunately I've heard nothing back which tells you plenty about what their customer service is like and what they think about their customers.My advise is don't buy anything fragile from Aldi and do not rely on customer services on ironing any issues out smoothly...... you might as well have words yourself even though you feel awkward doing so.",0,1

I called Aldi customer service to explain situation I was offered a refund 'the very least they could offer' I asked what I should do with broken items ... I was told I would have to dispose of them because it was a health and safety issue sending broken goods via the postal system ... shame that did not apply when they were delivering the goods to me I am very dissapointed with Aldi that they just passed the buck over to me ... we cannot put broken glass etc. In our bins I will have to rely on someone to take it to our local tip ... not very good after service Aldi ....,0,1

The percentage of the previous mix was about 45% and it tasted great. The new mix of Really Nutty shows the nut percentage as 10%. The Very Berry was even less.

Aldi UK,MOULDY FOOD!!! DO NOT SHOP AT ALDI,"In the last few weeks I have started to shop at aldi instead of tesco to reduce my weekly food bill. I spend approximately £80 - £90 a week at aldi, where as tesco is slightly more. Since shopping at aldi nearly every shop I have had the food has a terrible shelf life and often going off before the date on the packaging. A few weeks ago it was a large back of chicken breast, it had 3 days left on it and the smell was like nothing else. There was a smell in our fridge lingering but everything was in date so it couldn't be pinpointed until we opened the chicken. It was a Sunday evening so had to rush to out local out of hours shop and buy some more. The off aldi chicken was triple bagged and put straight in the bin.Last week, we had a pack of 3 courgettes and a pack or rasberries, both had 2-3 days left as per the packaging. When it came to use them the day after purchasing I found the courgettes to be slimey and mouldy and the raspberries again fluffy and mouldy. I emailed very clear photos showing the mould only to receive a response saying my comment/images will be passed onto the quality team! Yes I could have returned the food to my local store to exchange it but why would anyone want mouldy food in there fridge smelling. I have no where else to store it either.All I would have wanted was some sort of compensation towards the money I have lost purchasing the mouldy food, like any other food store would have done. Back to tesco I go for the foreseeable future.",0,1

People were queuing in one line and the staff only told people they didn’t have to when a lady decided to push in front of people. People were angry and the staff responded rude and inappropriately. They threatened to not serve customers for expressing their opinion. Even after upsetting multiple customers people were still queuing in one line and they didn’t bother to make an announcement to tell anyone. Upon leaving the shop a staff member (bold man) decided he would make a sarcastic comment to one of the customers as they were leaving. Inappropriate and uncalled for.

The staff are lovely and will have a chat at the checkouts even though things get scanned through the till quite quickly, happy to help if you are looking for something. I now do my shop here every week.Furthermore during the COVID crisis I can only applaud this store at how well managed it has been while managing queues to get into the store up an awkward escalator system, to disinfection stations, plastic screens, staggering shoppers to avoid pile ups in certain aisles and now there is a new traffic light system at the door that knows how many customers are inside.",0,5

Aldi UK,Aldi,"Aldi - Selly Oak - BirminghamIn queue, checkout girl rushed through items of customer in front & encouraged payment well before he was finished packing, and then went off to check in a delivery. After waiting 9 & half minutes(customer in front long gone!) I complained to the guy(with a head-set) on the next checkout & eventually he came over and put my few items through, just as missing check-out girl returned. I complained treatment was discourteous & he disagreed & she refused to take over from him in putting my shopping through! Outrageous treatment & I suspect head-set guy actually directed her abscondment to check in delivery !!!!Next time in store, I'm in the queue at last last socially distancing marker(line & footprints) level with beginning of conveyor - (store not very busy - 1 person behind me), customer in front loading his shopping, when guy on checkout(same one as last time I think) shouts out to me 'you need to move down or the aisles will be obstructed etc etc', no please or thank you and in a reprimanding tone!(I should point out that there's not a socially distancing marker at the end of the moving conveyer - so my next move was to go round to the end & load my bags. He could have handled this situation professionally & with courtesy, using language like, 'Ok, you're good to go' or 'You can move forward now' etc, without giving me a verbal beating/reprimand - I wondered if this was pay-back somehow for my last visit.After paying I did NOT get the customary, Thank-you!It would be good if they had cameras recording all this unnecessary hassle, which they could then use for staff training, but I think the problems go much deeper. I strongly suspect that in order to keep prices as low as they can & the owners pockets fat with cash, they skimp on staffing levels & training, leading to; queues often backing-up quite considerably, great difficulty in finding a staff member in store for assistance, inside of wheely baskets disgustingly dirty, discourteous and inappropriate behaviour from staff to customers, etc, etc. They could start by putting an extra social distancing marker level with the end of the moving checkout conveyor & then making sure that they treat customers in a way that they would like to be treated if the roles were reversed. If you're going to work successfully in the Service Industry, then you sometimes have to be appropriately servile, without ego & attitude, this is what customers expect & should receive, not to be treated like s*1t.You have to ask yourself whether the savings are really worth the extra hassle - which seems to be commonplace in Aldi. Personally, I think NOT! VOTE WITH YOUR FEET AND AVOID UNTIL THEY GET IT RIGHT OR GO BUST ! ! ! ! ! ! !",0,1

Aldi UK,First visit to Anerly store to shop and…,First visit to Anerly store to shop and return two online items. Before shopping decided to return my items at the checkout. Manager Alexandria was called who could not give me a refund on one of the items (a XL Mat) because I did not have the correct delivery note. So whilst in the store I called Aldi online customer services who were very efficient and polite. They were able to locate my Original order for the item (mat) and asked to speak to the manager to confirm the cost price of item I wanted to return. Aldi customer services told the manager to take the item as they would refund to my card via their system. This seemed to anger the manager and she became very rude & arrogant towards me whilst returning my second item - a griddle pan. I had not taken the griddle pan out of the box at all because it was too small for my hob. Even though item & packaging was in perfect condition the manager proceeded to scold me angrily because the tabs of the box packaging had slightly come out and complained that she could not sell it on. I repeat there was nothing wrong with item or packaging and was in perfectly resaleable condition. She was full of attitude towards me and I felt was looking for an argument! All I wanted to do was to return two items that were in perfectly resaleable condition and within the time limits of return policy but this manager seemed to have a problem with this from start to finish. She made me feel like I was causing her in inconvenience and was very angry with me. It was a most unpleasant experience with a very unpleasant person who is supposed to be a manager/leader and represent Aldi. Suffice to say I did not do my shop and left the shop as quickly as possible feeling very upset after my interaction with the manager of this store. I will not be returning to this store. Aldi please sort out the customer service provided by your in store staff - it costs nothing for your staff to be helpful and polite and may I remind you without customers you would have no business! I shudder to think what the rest of the staff are like in this store given that the store/general manager was so rude and completely lacking in customer service skills. I am disgusted and I will not be voting for Aldi in the WHICH best supermarket awards because of this experience!!!,0,1

Aldi UK,Cheap and nasty,Awful company with lots of false advertising. Adverts compare Aldis own cheap and nasty products with Tescos main brands rather than Tescos own brand food. Garbage special buys. No staff so massive queues at the tills. Have to avoid pallets dumped in the isles due to low staff numbers. Certainly not as cheap as when they started out. Prices now on a par with the big 4 supermarkets but Aldi products are sub standard. Not shopped here in ages and have no intention of ever starting again.,0,1

After a long while, when other customers began to queue behind me, the cashier opened the till but began by serving all of the other customers first, by inviting them to access the till from the other side, jumping in front of me.

Unfortunately it had a smashed screen 😔Contacted Customer service on Monday 15th. I was asked to supply photos of the damage which I did right away and I was assured that they would collect the damaged tv and send a replacement promptly. I won’t bore you with all the details but after countless calls, emails and courier no shows I am nearly 3 weeks later stuck with this broken tv. I currently have no idea when it’s going to be finally collected. Aldi will not offer a replacement or a refund until it is scanned back into their warehouse. I had to buy an alternative tv elsewhere so I’m seriously out of pocket while I wait and wait for this to be resolved. Also there is no monitoring of any case within Aldi so when for instance the courier doesn’t show up Aldi customer service has no idea and the whole process will stall until you phone again and re start the process. Also you have to phone and stay in a queue for about an hour each time as emails do not get answered. I have sent more than 20 over the last 3 weeks and have not had a single reply. So be warned if something goes wrong Aldi are just not capable or willing to give you a speedy resolution. Stick to the shops Aldi and leave online retail to the professionals.",0,1

On 2 occasions a member of staff just stood directly in front of me when I was looking at something without so much as an ""excuse me"". When I went to the till I was served by a woman so engrossed in conversation with someone on the other end of her headset, that she failed to say hello, goodbye or acknowledge me in anyway. The only time she bothered to speak to me was to tell me the total cost of my shopping. Manners cost nothing. Lack of manners cost you business.

Aldi UK,Been a customer with Aldi from the beginning counts for nothing,"Having been a customer from when Aldi first came to Hinckley on the A5 i have been with them ever since,on average i spend around £70 per week so over the years have spent a small fortune.About 3 weeks ago i bought a salter griddle pan which cost me £14.99 which i needed a refund on unfortunately i misplaced/lost receipt.The only way they would refund me was if i took bank statement in showing transaction,fair enough but over the 3 to 4 week period since buying griddle pan i have around 15 transactions and i don't know what date i purchased it on.I phoned Aldi customer services up and the lady was very nice and pleasant,she gave me a reference number to give manager at Aldi and that i would get a full refund.I gave the manager this who's name was Adam and from the beginning he was arrogant and not nice to deal with at all,the lady behind the till who serves me on a regular basis looked embarrassed and looked at me as if to say sorry.He phoned Aldi head office for a product code and said he can give me £7.99 as that was the price it was coming up with.I showed him snapshot from my phone showing item was £14.99 and i remember paying this and he said because i hadn't got receipt he could do nothing and walked away,i was so angry i put my shopping back on the convener belt that i had just bought for a refund and i will never use Aldi again.For the sake of £7 they have lost a good valued customer spending over £3600 per year,i even stopped 2 guys from stealing goods the other month and reported it and that's the thanks you get - GOODBYE ALDI WELCOME LIDL",0,1

Fuming is a understatement they informed me i could have a 20 percent refund and this would be £38, the only other option was for the table to go back, i informed them the table was in my garden made up so they would have to collect it like that to be told (that isn't going to happen) what kind of reply is that, asked to speak to a manager and was told she was a manager. Informed her i had no other option but to send it back but said I no longer had the box and she said just dismantle it and put it in bin bags, how is a 6 seater table ment to fit in a bin bag.

Aldi UK,Unnecessary packing policy - regardless of Covid,"Sadly, the return of Aldis, 'put everything back in the trolley as quick as possible', is back! Under the guise of Covid regulations it has made the rigid checkout experience stressful and miserable. In getting the customer to unpack their goods onto a secondary packing area after paying, in order to repack into bags, they have doubled the risk of Covid infection as I have never seen this area cleaned after use. It quite disgusting to buy food and have to spread them out on a dirty surface - items that will especially be hearing for your fridge! Aldi is letting down its loyal customer base by returning to these rigid and rushed packing policy - especially as there is not the queues at the check out to warrant the rush/repack. I felt stressed and harried and have sadly decided to not return to Aldi again. I will support the Lidl in Eastleigh, Hampshire where the staff adjust to the older customers by slowing the packing to their needs. Eastleigh Aldi staff are lovely and should not be put in this position of dictator packing police. Aldi stop this aggressive checkout experience!!",0,1

After digging a little deeper it appears this is a common problem with XDP but Aldi continues to use them! There is speculation that this courier is clearly stealing items (particularly egg chairs due to high demand and resale value) and nobody is doing anything about it! Beggars belief!! I will be reporting to Trading Standards! I have called them every day this week and was supposed to receive a phone call tonight before 8pm...surprise surprise it never happened! The online order customer service operators are so rude and do not care that their customers have not received their items, it’s very clear that you are a nuisance and they use sarcasm as a way to deal with you. Great supermarket however the online Specialbuys system does not work and they are giving themselves a very bad reputation by operating this way! AVOID AVOID AVOID!",0,1

Aldi UK,We are in our mid to late seventies and…,"We are in our mid to late seventies and need to shop together. I have been getting up early in the morning to get to my local Aldi, Kensington Close Kingsthorpe Northampton at 7.30am but found it difficult to do this. We have shopped at other Aldi's in Northamptonshire when we have been out and about so we thought that doing our main shop together at our local Aldi would not be a problem. So on June 1st we went down to our local Aldi to do our main shop together. Instead of it being a pleasant experience we were embarrassed and humiliated by some jumped up doorman who told us we could not shop together and only one of us would be allowed in. We refused to accepted this and went down to the Aldi branch at Towcester Road Northampton where we were more that welcome. When we returned home I phoned their head office and they were very apologetic and logged it as a serious complaint and said if it happened again to phone them straight away, they also said they would phone the store to make sure it would not happen again Well this morning it did happen again so I phoned Aldi head office but this time I had someone on the end of the phone with the personality of a bucket. They said that it was up to the store manager how many people he allowed in with a trolley. They also said that on my previous call to Aldi head office they could not have phoned the store as they do not have the store numbers, someone is lying We went to Aldi at Towcester Road Northampton and did did our shopping together with no problem. It would appear that the manager's have the autonomy to implement the rules as he sees fit and it would appear the manager at the Kingsthorpe store has gone right over the top and enjoying very minute of it.",0,1
Aldi UK,Cannot do the right thing for doing the wrong thing!,"I've seen it all now. I'm apparently giving people just too much social distancing in Aldi. I should be on the red line...not 1 foot behind it. While queuing at a checkout, I was unpleasantly barked at by the female cashier to move forward. When I did, I could tell she was not finished with me yet...told me AGAIN when I was next to the belt. When I said ""I know"", I was loudly and rudely told that she ""was only doing her job"". Pig-ignorant woman.I knew Aldi staff were not the best but this was a new low. Wellhall Road, Hamilton ML3 branch.Edit: I forgot to mention, I was in another queue but was told to also use Number 4.

Aldi UK,I am NOT happy,"I am NOT happy. During the current coronavirus crisis I have been virtually housebound, and relying on food parcel deliveries from various supermarkets. I chose to purchase from ALDI at they gave me a delivery slot for Wednesday - the day after my early-morning Tuesday order.I was informed that my parcel had been despatched and sent a tracking number for Hermes. I was a little alarmed that all through Wednesday the message from Hermes tracking was still waiting for the parcel, despite Aldi assuring me it was on its way. Two days later I have now received a message from Hermes that they finally have my parcel, but will be delivering on Friday - a full four days after ordering. If I was younger and fitter I could have WALKED toi Aldi in that time. I was relying on that parcel arriving yesterday in time for my tea and had to go to bed rather hungry after a scratch meal from what I had left.Please Aldi - DO NOT PROMISE to post essential food parcels for next day delivery if you are going to send out false e-mails of despatch and instead hold it in your warehouse for another day. This is unkind and cruel. A friend has told me not to hold my breath when the parcel arrives, as her one was full of badly-packed dented tins and spit-open packages, with packets of biscuits reduced to packets of crumbs. Clearly the contents are hurled into the box from a distance - probably a fun game for warehouse staff. But even those biscuit crumbs would have been a comfort yesterday, and now this evening I will have to again make do with what I have left in the cupboard as I wait for Friday.

I emailed customer services who after 3 replies have not done anything to reassure me that I will be spoken to with a little respect in future.

Aldi UK,"Store good, online dreadful!","Love the store, value for money and quality for the price is great. BUT where you are let down, Aldi, is your online delivery service! You really, really need to change the courier you use. Judging by the reviews for both Aldi and XDP you're losing customers left right and centre because items that have been bought and paid for just never turn up. Refunds might well be given but this is no consolation when you've sat up until 2am to join a massive online queue to be able to buy an item in the first place, that then can't be replaced when the courier ""loses"" (cough*steals*) it. Terrible choice of courier reflects terribly on Aldi.",0,2
Aldi UK,Another 1 star review for Aldi,"Another 1 star review for Aldi, mainly because of their delivery service and the subsequent poor customer service afterwards. As with others we spent a good sum of money online and paid the delivery charge. XDP deliver the product late with the Box all damaged and the delivery guy plainly didn’t give a T#ss just said ”Its all there” which it was but once of the previously round ends on one of the poles was now square. So we think Aldi are a decent company lets contact customer service about the issue. 1 Week later we get the response “ There are no more products left to replace this, Just take it back to a store for a refund” That’s it, No sorry for the mistake, no offer of any kind of compensation for the poor service or the fact we will have to lug a heavy product back to a store. If you are thinking of ordering online with Aldi, don’t, not until they start using a decent delivery service. As for their customer service its shockingly bad for a company that seem to pride itself on serving the customer.",0,1

After several phone calls to Aldi customer service initially to establish when the delivery would appear, I finished by cancelling the order. This, I was assured by the customer service person, would be confirmed by email immediately. What a surprise. No email received. Stay away. The online delivery service is appalling.As an update for this, I am still awaiting a credit, 28 days later for this non-delivery despite two more phone calls to their customer service line. There must be a law against this nonsense.I rang them again on 25th June. They have agreed a credit! It will take up to 14 working days for me to receive it apparently 'depending on my card issuer'.

Aldi UK,Never purchase anything online....... disgusting!!!!,"Personally their customer service is shocking!!!! This is not just because of one experience but many.........My biggest issue to date which is ongoing........2 weeks ago I purchased a tv from Aldi online. The item was delivered yesterday. I was incredibly excited, especially waiting 2 weeks for it...... after unpacking and switching on, would you believe it............the screen had a rectangle black block of dead pixels centre of the screen (top to bottom). Yes I was upset but hey ho I have an Aldi down the road, I can return and get my money back, wrong!!!!! The man informed me that they cannot refund me or send the it back for me as it is an online purchase, okay fair enough I thought. I came home and rang customer service, 30mins later I finally get to speak someone to be told they will pick it up next week and once the item has been received it takes 2 weeks for a refund. So let me get this right Aldi........ I purchase TV from you, you take my money, item is broken on delivery and I have to wait an extra 3 weeks for a refund even though there is an ALDI down the road after purchasing the 2 weeks ago. A 5 week process......... Disgusting and i will never buy anything from ALDI online again and will also be letting other people know!!! The Till, customer service is just something else!!!!Whilst shopping at Aldi, I was purchasing very few items and at the checkout I placed an open bag in the trolley so once than the lady had scanned my items it could simply be placed in the bag. Well the lady was rather abrupt and said ""you cannot do that, can you unpack your item from the bag and pack over there"". When I was explaining there are very few items to be scanned and that that placing the items in the bag is no slower than placing in the trolley, she still refused and said she will not continue to serve me until I remove my items out of the bag!!

Aldi UK,Extremely disappointed with Aldi…,"Extremely disappointed with Aldi online. We ordered a TP garden playhouse with slide. This took a while to get dispatched which was understandable given the current situation and pressures on the couriers. However when it did get delivered it had been dispatched in 3 separate parcels. The first 2 arrived fine, but there is still no sign of the 3rd parcel containing the slide. This is now well over 2 weeks since it should of arrived. Customer services have been contacted numerous times. Initially we were told that the if the item hadn't arrived by the following Friday it would be classed as lost in transit and we could be refunded for the slide. Multiple subsequent calls were made to keep being told they are waiting to hear from the courier. Now today we have been told that they will refund 10% of the whole value for the missing parcel, or we can return the whole item for a refund. Given the initial conversation we have built the wooden component awaiting the slide, so we cannot return the whole item. A 10% refund will nowhere near cover the cost of purchasing a replacement slide. Needless to say we will not be buying from Aldi online in future, and probably not in store given their level of customer service.",0,1

Aldi UK,This is a very sad complaint regarding…,"This is a very sad complaint regarding the horrendous service l received from the Epsom Aldi manager Sokol.I did a shopping worth £560 which is approximately 6 trolleys fullI was all by myself and I had pre informed the staff in advance, that I would require some assistance as it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to manage 6 trolleys all by myself. The female staff at the door said she could not help me, that I should ask the staff inside for assistance, that her job is to stand at the door and she couldn't jeopardize losing her job. When I could not manage the over filled trolleys anymore, I had to put some items down on an empty till to enable me get more items, so I entreated the manager to allow me keep my shopping to please get a staff to attend to me, as it was impossible for me to queue up with shopping of £560 wielding so many trolleys all by myself. He blatantly said ""No, you have to queue up ""....I explained l was happy to queue up and wait my turn, but l could not manage 6 trolleys on my own and l asked what he suggested l did.....he said ""I don't know, all l know is that you must queue up like other customers ""I reiterated that I am happy to queue up, but I needed some assistance, because I CANNOT possibly hold 6 trolleys worth £560 shopping all by myself. With the most belligerent monstrous sarcasm and insensitivity, he bluntly asked me ""What do you want me to do, do you expect me to leave my job and come help you do your shopping?""I have never been so dehumanised, almost like l was a street beggar asking him for free food, out of embarrassment, l told Him never mind. Even my fellow customers were sympathetic and offering me a helping hand with the excessive weight of the items and the store manager could not have the least empathy to offer any assistance.After two minutes of helplessness, he turned up with an empty trolley, which had a broken handle and said here, ""an extra trolley is the much l can do for you ""Wow....l said ""thank you, but how do you expect me to wield an extra trolley, without an extra pair of hands?""...he simply walked away in utter insolence and arrogance and ordered the new staff ""David"" to help me.I felt subjected to derision and mocked help, l said ""no David, don't help me""...turning to Sokol, l told him ""you do realise your job is to help the customer....that is what customer service is, l am doing so much shopping worth £560 - all by myself, which is equivalent to about 300 Aldi customers and you cannot be bothered to show any empathy or customer appreciation and offer any genuine assistance, your service is utter rubbish Sokol, even a self-checkout machine is more polite and professional than you as a person, and you are supposed to be the store manager setting an example for others "".He ignored and walked out on me .....l was not going to be subjected to any further affront for patronizing Aldi.I asked David and another staff to call Sokol to come help me himself, but he ignored me. I moved the many shopping trolleys and walked up to Sokol asking that he helped me, he bluntly said ""NO, I WILL NOT HELP YOU AND LEAVE THE SHOP NOW AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COME BACK HERE "".I told him I was going to make a complaint about his bestial service and in utter aggression, he said ""you can do whatever you want, I don't care""I asked for his details and he said and he said ""what for can you not READ my name tag?...Sokol, can you not spell it?....that is all you need"".I asked for details of his full name, he declined and l took a picture of him for exactitude, since he would not oblige his details or offer any courtesy or assistance to me as a customer....he threatened and yelled at me. I just ignored him and thankfully another manager intercepted asking him to get a grip of himself, but he carried on like an uncouth tout.The other manager eventually helped me and David was kind enough to assist me with moving the heavy shopping.

Really? I waited 10 days and nothing turned up and then the XDP tracking status changed to ""DELIVERED"" on the original day it was supposed to be delivered. How could they do that? I have since phoned ALDI Customer Services a further 4 times and they just don't care, tried speaking to a manager but won't put me through to one. They are disputing delivery and are waiting to hear from XDP (good luck with that). I explained that all they need to do is check their phone records and they will see who is lying. I will never use ALDI online again and I urge anyone to think twice about purchasing larger items from ALDI, particularly items that are going to be delivered by XDP. I suppose you get what you pay for with ALDI,",0,1

Aldi UK,Rude and aggressive service from Sharon and Gordon in Paignton.,Reported both members of staff to their Head Office following their disgusting behaviour on my visit on 20th May 2020. Got a reply from their Head Office who apologised and left the local store manager to deal with it. Not really sure how they think they can talk to people that - especially Sharon. Other reviewers on Trust Pilot and Google have also complained about her particular brand of customer service. Rude little person.,0,1
Aldi UK,Not a safe place to shop...,"Decided to goto Aldi in Hythe today and OMG, I will never shop there again, no social distancing in place, no controlled entry and the shop was packed with shoppers, floor markings and a sign and it was so busy that you had to walk within one foot to pass people and if you held back people was pushing past you, out of the whole shop there were 4 people wearing masks, this was my first trip to the supermarket since lockdown began and omg did I choose the wrong shop, I should have carried on and gone to Sainsbury's a quarter of a mile away.I also thought that there was supposed to be a traffic light system in place? Not at this store, NO wipes or cleaner for the trolleys or baskets, was in the que for the checkout and a shelf stacker squeezed beside us and was restocking the shelf, absolute joke, utterly appalled and will never go to this store again, just in shock for the clear lack of social distancing in this store.Another issue is how astoundingly rude the staff are, most shops would sack their staff if they spoke to customers in such a rude manner.",0,1
Aldi UK,I purchased a product from Aldi on…,I purchased a product from Aldi on Friday 22nd May it finally arrived on Monday 1st June. To be fair Aldi did advise it could take up to 7 working days to arrive but I did not hear anything from them for 6 days and when I finally got through to customer services they told me it was a pre-order for 31st May (nothing on the website about preorder when I placed the order). two hours later I get a message from XDP? to advise they were collecting my order from Aldi that day (what about pre-order 31st May). Tracked the order through Aldi website and found it arrived at local depot on Friday 29th. Courier then sat on it for 3 days and delivered it 1st June. I understand Covid is causing problems to all suppliers but I get the feeling this is an Aldi logistics/stock control problem which in todays world needs improvement. thankfully the product is good although again Aldis product description was woefully inadequate. I had to read reviews to get a proper list of benefits etc.,0,3
Aldi UK,One of the lucky ones,I ordered 2 items on the 20rh may. 1 item was 21st may pre order. The pre order item arrived on time delivered by hermes.

Got an email &txt with delivery day and time slot . It came when it said (2nd june). It was a garden light up tree box was little battered but it worked. Must be 1 of the lucky ones. Would i order again off Aldi not sure .might not be so lucky next time,0,5

I have chased and chased with aldi until on 2nd June after many conversations they believe xdp have lost my item As they have now sold out i am never going to get my item have requested a refund, this will take 3-5 working days so i hope i dont have to chase them on this next weekWish i had just ordered from amazon prime and we would have had this in a couple of days rather than a waiting for a month from aldiBE WARNED, I AM NOT ALONE WITH LOTS OF OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH SIMILAR WOESI have notified and sent this to aldi but do not expect to get a response I run an e commerce retail website and would not dream of treating customers in this way",0,1

Aldi UK,I honestly feel so upset about the…,"I honestly feel so upset about the service we have received from aldi. £181 down and no item as courier lost 1 of the 3 parcels. Have emailed and called so many times, normally with a 45min wait to get through to an advisor each time. Customer service has been disgusting, no help whatsoever. Then after weeks of calling when they finally accepted parcel was missing they said the item is now out of stock. So have to wait for that SAME delivery company Xdp to collect parts that were delivered (over a week before they can collect) and wait until aldi have received those parts (if they ever do) before they will issue refund which will be another 5working days on top of that. I'm so exhausted dealing with this horrible company and wish I had never purchased from them. We aren't a rich family and were so pleased when we were able to order a playhouse and slide for our son but it has been the biggest mistake we made ordering from here. Now don't have the money to order elsewhere, no playhouse, and a very upset 2 year old who can't understand why a picture of a playhouse and slide on a box and a big green slide have been sitting in our hallway for weeks and he hasn't been able to play with them. Also countless times on hold and trying to talk to someone whilst looking after a 2 year old and still getting nowhere, has just been stressful. Will be warning everyone I know never to shop online with aldi.UPDATE: order was originally dispatched 14th of May 2020, they have had the item back since 14th June 2020 (organising a collection for the refund was another nightmare in itself). It's now the 29th of June 2020 and STILL no refund. Anyone have any ideas how we get our money back from this company????",0,1

Aldi organised to have order picked up which the tenants messaged me when it was picked up - I called Aldi and they told me courier had picked up and was at depot waiting to be returned to Aldi at which point refund would be issued. All absolutely fine and I waited two weeks before calling back - Aldi then told me that not only had they not received order, the courier couldn't collect it. I told them I knew this to be incorrect as a few days earlier I had been to see the tenants. Aldi said they would investigate and get back to me. That was 3 months ago.In that time I have sent over 10 emails and called 8 times - I've had one email reply and on each call I get promised a call back from a manager. Not once have the ever called me back. Today i refused to get off call until spoke with a manager who was close to laughing about the situation and just said there's nothing we can do, unless you have proof that we received the item back (of course impossible) then we won't pay you anything back. I explained there was nothing else I could show and she couldn't care less, just said 'sorry, nothing we can do' and ended the call.I have shopped with Aldi for a long time and always had a great experience but this is beyond unacceptable, it is pure theft.

Aldi UK,Appalling quality vegetables and poor staff adherence to social distancing rules,Appalling quality vegetables and management (Jack Oxspring- Sheffield Archer Lane store) who are more concerned with maximising profit rather than quality of produce. Some staff members (including the afrementioned manager) are also very poor at adhering to social distancing with customers. I've lost count of the number of times I've returned from a shop only to find that the vegetables were mouldy and/or well past their best. When raised with management they were not at all receptive to the issue and we're quite happy to continue selling the items.

However as we got in there there was no social distancing being adhered to everyone was next to each other and leaning over each other me and my partner was speaking to each other about how bad it was (she was doing our neighbours shopping) all of a sudden the security guard approached us and told my partner she had to leave as it’s 1 from each household we explained that we was doing separate shopping 1 for some one vulnerable but he was rude and right in our faces telling her to get out so we both left instead me leaving shopping in a trolly in the aisle as he was very aggressive. We have heard friends have had similar altercations with this guy 1 who was told his kids would have to wait outside for him . We all have a lot to deal with during this corona virus stuff and the shopping aspect is a nightmare but to do this to people is bad we hadn’t done anything wrong and was belittled in front of lots of people it was embarrassing.like I said we will be telling everyone to give it a clear birth we went straight to Tesco’s after and they was fantastic excellent distancing and wiped all the trolleys down that’s my new supermarket.,0,1
Aldi UK,One for star is being generous if…,One for star is being generous if option for zero I would have put that. I went to Aldi in Bearwood last night after 8pm cause it's usually quieter and was horrified of what I witnessed. When we arrived there was a queue so we waited. When it was our turn to go in the security guard said only one we replied ok can one go in then the other when someone comes out cause we are doing separate shops. He refused he let me in and I assumed the other person would be allowed when someone came out. Anyway security guard refused him entry and when he asked why the security guy said cause I don't want to let you in then he let loads of other people in instead. It gets worse the security was aggressive and did same to guy behind with his family and 2 children so the guy blocked the door way asking what the rules are. Security guard then physically grabbed the customer no social distancing no mask and when customer got free and created space between them the security guard did a flying superman punch at the customer in front of children and queue of customers. Police attended but the security guy was still allowed to carry on with his shift.its a disgrace they had been letting in couples and families in all the time people are confused no signs up. I spoke to manager he said I'm not interested in your opinion so I replied that I won't be back in here again and he said gd my security guard acted in the right way.

The store layout would lend itself very well to a one-way system. No signage of any kind to indicate that there was a specific aisle for queuing for the checkouts - only a chap at the first checkout shouting instructions to everyone - felt quite sorry for him!. It is no surprise that their staff turnover seems to be quite high from what I have seen - they seem to be expected to do everything, although they are always friendly enough.

I uploaded a photo to Twitter and they asked me to contact the helpline in the product manual for advice or exchange. I asked how exchanging it would help and they used standard response 'we hope this was an isolated incident'.

I ignored his looks and started looking the other way, because it was making me feel very upset. After waiting for a long while we got to the front of the que/line, all the while Aldi's security guard could see that we were together, but he never said a word about any specific rules or fore-warned us in any way. After a long wait, when we got to the front of the que/line and it was our turn, Aldi's racist security guard made up a rule that we can't use same trolley, I had been there with wife and had used a single trolley together. Still, we said okay we will get two trolleys. He then made us second rule saying because you are not standing on two separate markers, although we were keeping legal distancing intact, you can't go in now. My elderly neighbor then moved to marker behind us, as lady behind us allowed him to come back a spot. Aldi's security guard then told us you can't do that either and refused our entry. I then left in rage, feeling extremely aggravated and upset refusing to tolerate his racist looks and behavior any longer. My neighbor told me he then also started saying to the elderly Asian/Muslim man that he can't go in either; old man had to beg to him as he had waited so long and it would have impossible for him to stand for such long time all over again. My neighbor told me that the racist security guard took it upon himself to BAN me for life for standing up to his racist behavior, I was wondering if Aldi will give him bonus or BAN is my only punishment?",0,1

Aldi UK,Garbage,"Garbage. So 3 weeks ago i was made to stand out side the store in DARTFORD on my own and split up from my carer because the security guard doesn't speak english too well and didnt understand that i was physically disabled and required a carer in able to be mobile. He allowed my carer to enter but not me because of company ""poicy"" that required only one person at a time to enter the store. Then, because i ""argued"" with the security guard he decided he would punish me by forcing me outside the store and letting in everyone else in the line. Apparently its a common exercise that shelf stackers in the store act as managers, if a customer wishes to complain about something, then ignore everything you just complained about because your actually just speaking to doug the trolley wally.I complained about this to aldi customer services and they promised me a £20 gift voucher. Which never turned up. Rang them again and was told ""we never said that"" even though i have the conversation recorded.People say how wunderbar aldi's is especially in the media, but its a garbage store selling pound shop products under a different name",0,1

A customer assistant came & asked one of us to leave. I showed him a white couple at the till & he straight away said,one of them is a carer. It clearly looked they were couple. He lied to cover his back. I went outside & didn't do the shopping. Stood outside & it was queuing & was watching what they were doing. A gentlemen at the door who claimed to be supervisor & manager let a person go with who claimed was his daughter & was an adult. It was clear racism as my was wearing nuqab. I have the picture of the so called manager at the front of the store cleaning trolley handles & managing queues at the front at 12.15 pm on 27th May;if Aldi needs to see it.It was really unprofessional for Aldi to stop a couple from shopping as Aldi has lost a customer & would also encourage the same to family & friends to stop using Aldi. Aldi should reconsider there policy when other superstores like Asda,Tesco & Morrison allow couple to shop together in there stores.Mr Shah Panvala",0,1

I ordered a table and chairs online and a month later I am still waiting. I ordered 2 extra chairs from the same manufacturer and they were delivered within 2 days.

If you are ever unhappy with any of our products, please take the packaging and your receipt to store on your next visit and the Store Manager will be happy to refund or replace the item for you. Once again, thank you for contacting Aldi Customer Services and we look forward to your continued custom. Yours sincerely As Lidl have just opened a branch earlier in the year they are obviously wanting me to shop there",0,1
Aldi UK,Good service,Sorry to here bad reviews as I know how it feels when you get crap service . However for me I ordered a dog bed and it was delivered 3 days later with live tracking so I’m very happy with Aldi on this occasion,0,4
Aldi UK,"Awful day at aldi, I won't be back","Aldi needs to improve their customer service, as I had a horrible experience today. They said I had to put everything in the trolley and pack later, I had one of those big bags that fixes to the trolley, I was throwing things to the bag without organising anything and they accused me of breaking the rules (social distance). I was very upset as I wasn't, the person in the till said I have to unclipped the bag because I was breaking the rules, I said I wasn't and I said if you need to call the manager do it as she already had threatened with it. I was amazed that the manager also had a go at me saying I was packing too. I left the store in tears really upset. I was actually working doing shopping for ederly as I'm a carer. I won't be back. I can see one day they're going to have real trouble as they haven't got any common sense or manners. This was in High Wycombe Baker Street",0,1
Aldi UK,Lynsey store manager Oban branch.,"Lynsey store manager Oban branch.BEWARE if you need to return anything (the item returned was faulty and not fit for purpose)). She’ll do anything to embarrass her paying customers by deliberately trying to make it difficult to give you a refund. She was cheeky, unprofessional and ‘loud’ accusing me of not buying the item in an Aldi’s store. She also said she couldn’t refund me as she didn’t have a ‘code’. This was all done within ear-shot of other customers and another (lovely) member of staff. I complained to Head Office but it was a standard letter I received back. I’ll presume they’re not that interested!! Hence why Aldi’s is starting to get a bad reputation. Good staff training is ‘key’ to how a business survives!!!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Thank you to all the key workers of Aldi,"I am extremely impressed with Aldi and they so deserve this excellent review. I do the majority of my shopping at Southmead and Henbury, Bristol stores and since this pandemic they have excelled over and above any other Supermarket I have recently visited; from the assistant on the door ready with the hand sanitizer always friendly, welcoming, smiling and helpful, going that extra mile to collect a trolley for you and sanitizing it before you enter the store and reiterating the 2 metre rule around the store to the orderly queue at the checkout. Their instructions are always precise and clear as to what you need to do. The checkout operators are always very helpful and friendly too but have gone above and beyond in this crisis situation. Well done Aldi for being remarkable key workers and thank you all for making myself and, I am sure everyone else, feel safe in your stores during these uncertain and worrying times.",0,5
Aldi UK,"To the short, ginger deputy manager","I went in the store (Leicester, Syston) for an enquiry about any work before this whole corona came about, and all I remember is the deputy manager rolling his eyes at me, raising his voice slightly and saying ""It's all online"" just loud enough for the rest of the store to turn and stare, rest assured I haven't been to an aldi store since nor has any of my relatives.",0,1
Aldi UK,Law abiding citizen harassed,"I was in the Rice Lane, aldi in Liverpool on 12th May 2020. I was buying an item for a relative, but when I phoned her she said she didn't want the product after all. Having not bought anything, I went through a checkout to leave the store and the two security guards prevented me from leaving and demanded to see what was in my bag. They were extremely intimidating and unapologetic and of course found nothing in my bag. . I complained to the manager who said they were just doing their job This isn't the first harassment I have had off aldi security guards. They are vile people.",0,1
Aldi UK,Poor shopping experience,"The Aldi store in Heanor needs to relook at their approach towards their customers, This evening the guy on the till was speaking to customers like they were animals, he even stressed out an elderly couple to the extent the gentleman couldnt even think where he had put his bank card..Your member of staff clearly needs some customer service training ASAP!!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Purchased a gas bbq on the 7th April,"Purchased a gas bbq on the 7th April, out the bbq together to find a essential nut was missing which screws into a bit for the gas bbq. As such I am unable to use the gas bbq. I have been chasing their after sales team who are called best buying service who are actually based in the Netherlands! Who assured me this has been sent. 5 weeks on nothing has been received and all I get from them that it’s been sent but they are unable to provide Proof. Aldi customer service have said they will past my feedback on for future. THIS DOESNT SOLVE MY ISSUE OF THE MISSING PIECE THAT MAKES THE BBQ USELESS!! we are unable to connect the gas bottle! No one has responded to my email complaint In 5 weeks either. Basically 150quid down the pan!",0,1
Aldi UK,"Taken Money, not delivered wont reply to emails","Failed to deliver, Hermes website parcel held 24 hours and 1 week later still showed the same message so clearly, package was lost. Emailed Aldi - no reply! Called Aldi held for 40 minutes, told I had to wait 10 working days for them to look at even though it was clear on Hermes site package was lost. Emailed again 10 days later ignored. Emailed 3rd time 14 days later ignored. Currently holding. The problem is lazy low paid staff that have zero brain cells and can't be bothered to look into why the order hasn't been delivered. So at present Aldi has taken my money, not delivered goods, and is ignoring emails about where my delivery is. That's called THEFT!!! If you want to be robbed of your money and then ignored go ahead and shop online with Aldi!Disgusting attitude! As you will see from other reviews the german owners think this service is acceptable so they are mugging us brits off (sound familiar)?!Update 1-week later - just had a call back from a Manager, guess what she said?! My package has been lost by Hermes - YOU DONT SAY!!! So finally they are going to refund me which will take 3-5 working days. Full of empty apologies and couldn't really care less attitude. They did advise that they agreed with Hermes the delivery company that if Hermes update package on a particular date as ""delayed"" or whatever other lame details they post on the tracking info that Aldi cant contact Hermes for 10 days. This shows how little they care about their customers as they are putting their delivery company above its customers need to find out where the customers order is that the customer has paid for. As long as Aldi has your Money and Hermes have your package who are you the customer to query when/if/where or how you will ever get your package!! They expect you to shut up and put up with their shoddy service. Vote with your feet I will never again order from this bunch of incompetents!",0,1

Aldi UK,Order placed for delivery on 3/5,Order placed for delivery on 3/5. Emailed customer services several days ago requesting information when I can expect my order but not even the courtesy of a response despite the fact my card was debited back in April.

Aldi UK,Aldi Risking covid-19 to customers & Staff,"The reason why I am giving a one star rating is to do with the current situation that Aldi's have now increased the amount of customers coming into the store ,it was 40 now increased to 60 customers ,therefore because there are more people in the store , they are now not allowing customers to pack at the till . Customers now have to do this at the packing area because Aldi know that if they allow packing at the till then customers will not be able to shop properly and there will be longer queues in the store therefore no 2 metres social distancing would take place . I was at the Hemel Hempstead Branch today , the cashier got stroppy and was trying to say that I am rude when I continue to place my milk into the bag that was in the trolley at the till but what she failed to see or couldn't understand the concern I had was the packing area already had 6 people there who wasn't even 2 metres apart from each other . the store is small therefore there is nowhere else for me to go to do my packing , this is putting all customers and staff at risk of covid -19 . If Aldi wants to pack everyone into the store then provide customers with face masks or flex the restrictions I.e place marked out allocated slots in the packing area and when these are full allow the customers to pack at the till when the store is at its busiest time or reduce the amount of customers coming through the door .",0,1
Aldi UK,COVID-19 RISK TO CUSTOMERS,"COVID-19 - crazy people at ALDI Langley Park Maidstone are insisting that they must put food from conveyor belt into a basket. at the checkout. They get the basket from a pile next to the till. I asked if baskets were cleaned before they used them or whether it was just being handled by one customer after another., without cleaning in between. They said they were cleaned, but when i asked which pile was for ""dirty"" or potential contaminated baskets with people touching COVID-19 etc, they indicated the same pile they had just got the baskets from to return it to. I asked where the cleaning wipes etc were so i could wipe the basket before and after touching it, they didnt have any at the till. I saw some hand sanitizer at the till and asked to use that before i touched the potentially contaminated basket they insisted i was to touch and they refused. i then watched them put the basket i had touched back into the ""clean"" pile to reuse for the next customer without cleaning. Infection control? no chance, clearly they had no idea. When challenged about this, staff became stroppy. I suppose if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. Is a few quid of savings on shopping in ALDI LANGLEY PARK worth it when Morrisons is just up the road, is the few quid savings worth dying for? No, Morrisons here i come - who i note have hand sanitizer and trolley and basket wipes at the entrance. Do yourself a favour, spend a tiny bit more at Morrisons down the road and SURVIVE COVID-19 :-) or carrying on shopping at ALDI LANGLEY PARK, save a couple of pence and die the richest man in the grave yard",0,1
Aldi UK,Non existent customer service,Food parcel ordered 27th April with 2/3 day delivery promised. Now May 10th and all Hermes will say is they have had the parcel since 28th April and it will be delayed by 24 hours. 2 emails of complaint sent to Aldi without the courtesy of even a reply.Customer service is non-existent from both Aldi and Hermes One star rating given but that is because I can't give a mius score,0,1

Aldi UK,I'm disgusted by the poor customer…,"I'm disgusted by the poor customer service and hideous attitude of one shop assistant working in Aldi Maidstone usually outside in the evenings. This evening he is there as well and as usual he is discriminating some people and deciding who to let straight in and who to keep waiting outside for some time. He does that just to have fun and has a grin on his face most of the time. He is quite chubby, blond-ish and he is not English. I hope you can identify this person and let him go because he really is a disgrace and his bad behaviour can't and shouldn't be tolerated.",0,1
Aldi UK,ABUSED AND BULLIED BY MANAGERS,"If I could take stars away, I would! I was abused and laughed at by ALDI STAFF last week, in the Rice Lane Liverpool 9 store... THREE MEN ( 1 security guard and 2 managers) accosted me and my disabled Mother ( 2 women) as we were shopping together!! we were stillkeeping our 2 meter distance but the guard heard us talking and reacted in this VILE way! We were then told to leave - and as I calmly complained that we could not shopalone, I was laughed at and jeered!!! I called their complaints line and they said there was nothing I could do - and would not release the CCTV where these men began to gather around and get SERIOUSLY close to me -( completely ignoring my requests to step back to regard the National Crisis social distance guidelines) I’m a vulnerable adult and my Mother is disabled!!

Aldi UK,Dairy free foods,"I am writing to say how impressed I am with Aldi. My youngest child is milk intolerant so we need dairy free foods such as yogurts, cereals, milk for his growth development. Nowadays, Aldi has oat and soya milk, vegan yogurt, dairy free spread, and at such great prices too. Normally I would do a shop at Aldi and an expensive top up shop at Sainsbury’s, but now I don’t have to. There are a lot of ‘surprise vegan’ foods too, such as biscuits and cereals, that are suitable for my dairy free child. Thank you Aldi and please carry on stocking these products.",0,5

Aldi UK,Racist and very untrained worker,I walked into Aldi shop at Dunstable with my wife picked everything with some alcohol after queuing . At the til my wife who is 30+ because She is black and other race find difficulties getting her estimate age so they asked for her ID which she didn’t have on her. So i presented my ID. The shop lady didn’t even want to see my ID. she just came to the conclusion she can’t sell the Alcohol because one person doesn’t have an ID of which i was the one paying. When i tried to inquiry more about the so called policy which they have in place now she said because one person doesn’t have an ID they can’t sell and they can’t sell even if my wife came back to the shop same day with her ID. I have never felt humiliated and wasted my time queuing to leave without my shopping. These shop workers felt like authoritarian dictator who don’t care. Cheap shops are indeed expensive with this kind of poor staff training. The likes of Tesco/Sainsbury/Asda will never treat people this way,0,1

I happened to mention i then had to take this to the care and go round a second time for another family.Nicky didn’t hesitate in saying to leave the trolley paid for with her and just to grab another and go round. I really did feel that she felt my pain of waiting in the heat and the time - which was excellent customer service and so unexpected.After my second full trolley she then asked another assistant - who i have to apologise i cant remember her name but she too was very kind and helped bring the second trolley to the car.Your staff are just so helpful in such awful times its nice to see service has not gone out the window.Ive never had to food shop in my life...something my mum always did but now is unable to and i am really pleased i have found my local Aldi.The store is clean, and well looked after, well stocked etc...I just want to say thank you to all of you for your hard work and a special thank you to Nicky for today.",0,5

Aldi UK,I recently tried to purchase a 5 in 1…,"I recently tried to purchase a 5 in 1 multi tool for the garden. The purchase went through at the end of March. I received the goods after 5 days damaged. After spending several hours on the phone to their customer service where I was told that they were aware XDP were awful and often broke items on deliveries (why use them!!?) and advised to go to the warranty company for spare parts after being told to assemble the goods and test them.... another several hours wasted. I then waited for contact that never replied, So, I phoned to replace the goods. It then took a further 10 days plus several hours chasing and three collection attempts to collect the goods. At which point, I was assured I would receive the replacement inside 5 days of collection.10 days later I was still chasing their support. I received one reply by email from their support in the first two weeks and after that they did not reply at all.Finally I got through to customer services on Tuesday the 5th May. By now I had paid £137 food goods in March that I had never used... I was 40 days into the purchase.I was told my case was escalated and I would be called by the manager......two days later no call and the day after an automated email saying I will be refunded inside 10 days.DO NOT BUY FROM ALDI ONLINE. If I’d purchased from amazon it would have been done in days and even if there was a problem it would have been replaced instantly.Utterly shocking service... if I could rate zero I would.

Aldi UK,What a disappointment ... never again,"Okay, I understand Aldi is a supermarket brand and we totally appreciate their hardworking staff within the shops ... but crikey me, their online customer support systems are absolutely appalling. Non arrival of high value item from their website after 22 days and their customer support just blame their contracted couriers, they say they can't help me for 15 days when the item may be reported lost at which time I may get a refund. They failed to realise my contract to supply was with Aldi, not the courier company they had contracted. Their customer support made absolutely zero attempt to trace the product or speak to their courier to track the £300.00 value item. Left me out of pocket and with no possibility of getting the item within any specified time frame. Don't waste your time either sending messages to customer support or even emailing them ... they do not respond. Dreadful. Decided to just seek reddress through my credit card company as the only viable solution, Aldi can have the inconvenience of a chargeback case. All this due to their lack of customer awareness and support. Aldi ought respect the trust placed in them by their customers and provide adequate support. I actually felt I was an inconvenience to them.",0,1
Aldi UK,"Aldi, Deal, Kent","The one located in Deal, Kent that just opened is ridiculous and rude. Went in there first time got a fine of £80 for parking with no clear signage saying you need to register your registration number in the shop and even no help with the staff who are utterly rude for a new shop. Also the rules for social distancing are completely different from other shops, whereas in Tesco you can go as a family but here they only let one family member in the shop. The lady in charge of the line shouted at my mum who did not know their rules 3 times in front of everyone in the queue and embarrassed her. The rude lady never even mentioned their rules properly until I asked her but she was saying it nicely to every other person. I’m just wondering if it was because my mum was wearing a hijab and that shes of other ethnicity and not white like everyone else in the queue was.

Aldi UK,Humiliated at Aldi In Kempston,"Humiliated at Aldi in Kempston Bedford, yesterday afternoon, for daring to ask if I could put my glass bottles in a large Hessian bag which was in my trolly.We all know that you need to be speedy quick at the till when going through the checkout, and I am, I load everything on the belt super quick, then I literally throw it in my large bags which are placed open in my trolly (hence avoiding irritated cashiers) and Im off, however what you don't expect is the cashier to be aggressive and rude, and you certainly don't expect rude & negative comments in return to anything you try to say. Being in my 50s I can say without doubt this is the most stressful and unpleasant shopping trip I have ever experienced.I wanted to explain to the cashier, that I have painful bursitis elbows and a rotator cuff shoulder, so really I needed to put everything straight into the bags (large hessian bags already lining my trolly) which my husband then lifts into the car. Not a chance, wasn't even allowed to finish a sentence, was told "" No you have to put it into your trolly - no bags"" I actually had to take my bags out of the trolly, was then threatened with the manager, cashier than called the manager, cashier then ranted to the manager in the same way she ranted at me and the manager said .. ""Finish processing the shopping"" and left. Cashier looked angry, manager looked unamused.This cashier gets my vote for the most aggressive cashier of the year ... in fact the worst in over 30 years of family shopping ... well done and thank you again, in particular for then making derogatory comments about me to the next customer as i was walking away form the till... really thoughtful of you.However its actually fine to be treated in this way, who am I anyway.. I don't deserve a smile or a helpful comment, Im just cash in a till, customers have no value in this shop, Im just like all the other stressed shoppers, waiting their turn in the queue, and wondering why they may feel slightly anxious as they get nearer the cashier. Well thats life..tough, if you want to save money and shop at Kempston Aldi .. then you will have to walk the plank and at times, be treated as if you are a second rate person, who deserves no better .. after all you are probably working class, perhaps on a limited budget (like me) so you can be treated like a nuisance, cheap goods means cheap service in this store.Such a relief to see all the other supermarkets hitting back with like for like pricing on so many products ... Now I am going to make a protest with my feet, Im going back to the other supermarkets .. just think, no dirty looks or rude comments from cashiers or customers waiting with 4 items while you process two weeks shopping, no explaining and apologising for having a problem with your mobility, imagine being served by a cashier who would smile like a humane and say "" Hi how are you today, Im suddenly getting excited , I could actually go back to enjoying my supermarket trip, not feeling anxious, maybe even look forward to it!! and to top it all, if you buy the right products, not much difference in your bill or even better.Life is just to short for the arrogance of Aldi and its money money money values, stressed staff, anxious customers. Im done after my 6 year prison sentence at Aldi .. Im free, Tesco, Sainsbury's Morrisons, Asda .. Im back and thank you for cutting a bit of your profit margin and training your staff so I can be treated with a bit of respect.Aldi not even COVID 19 has taught you the value of people.",0,1

As I said I don't mind if it takes longer. Tracking takes me to XDP. Contacted both yesterday to be told from Aldi that XDP have it, then XDP say they don't have it, that Aldi still has it and hasn't released it to them. Phone Aldi again just to be told they don't have it again.. 2 big companies with no communication at all between each other yet working with each other.

Aldi UK,Bad Store Management,"When it came to the tills, the lady serving refused to serve me as I wanted to drop my shopping straight in my bags due to a new COVID 19 Aldi policy stating no packing at the tills, despite me agreeing eventually to pack at the side. I disagree with this as it means I need to touch more surfaces than necessary and stay in the store longer than necessary. This however is not my biggest issue, my biggest issue is with the checkout supervisor Sam allowing other cashiers to allow other customers to pack at the tills. I raised this with him and he laughed it off stating it was up to the cashier and if I carried on he would be “thrown out.” Yet, when all I wanted was an acknowledgement that to allow cashiers to do different things is wrong and leads to individual customers feeling 'picked on' and 'singled out.' Also, a manager he needs to enforce policy's fairly and consistently. He made no efforts to acknowledge, rectify or apologize for the lack of consistency and instead just laughed it off with an 'I'm not bothered attitude' especially when I stated I would take this further. I appreciate that as a company you need to protect your staff and I appreciate that the lady cashier was only trying to do her job correctly, but, it doesn't make the lack of consistency right and also his lack of ability to manage and deal with the situation without resorting to threats or removal. With the actual rule itself, I don't agree with it as it takes longer for me to be at the till and also to get out the shop, although I can appreciate the reason for it.",0,1

The pervious customer had walked away but unknown to us she had forgotten to pick a bag on the floor Which is why she returned just as I moved forward.The rude cashier then started telling how I would not like it if I had to spend three weeks in hospital as she had with the virus. The nerve of this cashier who I may add is protected behind a Perspex shield has no idea what it is like to work on the front line and then to claim she had the virus then accuse me of trying to cause harm to someone else left me visibly shaken and upset .After the care she would of received by a NHS nurse to enable her to return to work is further more upsetting.HOW DARE YOU ALLOW THIS PERSON TO SPEAK TO CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS ALDI ??",0,1

Aldi UK,Honesty and a disability not appreciated,"Visited the Aldi store in Sittingbourne today with my husband. We queued outside for a short while whilst waiting to be directed inside. There were plenty of signs asking people to keep a distance, but non at all saying only one member of a family could go inside. When it was my turn to go in the gentleman on the door asked me if my husband and I were together and being an honest person I said yes. However I was told only one of us could go in to the shop. I explained to the person I cannot lift or carry items due to arthritis and a curved spin so need someone with me. My husband couldn’t go in on his own as he (typically) had no idea of what we needed. So we ended up going somewhere else to shop. Interestingly there were large family groups coming out of the supermarket together and I saw plenty of couples packing at the checkouts. Obviously I should have pretended my husband wasn’t with me as honestly and a disability are not appreciated by Aldi’s. Therefore I will not be returning again.",0,1

Aldi UK,Think Twice About Shopping at Aldi Tranent During Coronavirus Lockdown,"I did my first shop in the Tranent store last night around 6.15pm after recovering from Coronavirus myself and was shocked and disgusted that there was no staff member keeping customers right regarding social distancing. There were large family groups and shoppers wandering around the store deliberately ignoring the signage and indeed store staff walked directly past me and an elderly couple when I was shopping. Not entirely surprised given that the manageress (tall, dark hair, ponytail) treats customers with utter contempt under normal circumstances - talks constantly and swears on headpiece to other staff members whilst serving on the till (2 young lads do this also). I understand that if customers deliberately flaunt the Government's guidelines that store staff can't stop them but the staff I saw certainly aren't leading by example. A family member brought my shopping when I was ill and shopped at the Gilmerton and Cameron Toll Aldis and said they were fantastic - well organised and the staff doing everything they possibly can to keep customers right regarding social distancing - and she felt very safe. I will be shopping there in future.",0,1
Aldi UK,Abrupt staff & unreasonable restrictions - serious clarification required!,"A friend & her husband - regular Aldi shoppers - visited their local Aldi store in Rotherham to do their weekly family shop and to shop for her vulnerable mother. They each took a trolley, observing the 'one shopper to one trolley' instruction, but were stopped at the entrance by a rather abrupt assistant with a walkie-talkie who asked if she and her husband were together. She said yes and explained that they were each carrying out a separate shop and that they were abiding by Aldi's shopping instructions. They were told that they couldn't both enter the shop as only one person was allowed per household! Needless to say, they walked away and took their custom to a competitor and have vowed never to shop at Aldi again! The treatment they received from Aldi staff on this occasion was not in the spirit of providing support to the vulnerable in these difficult times, or of abiding by the government instruction to keep travel and mixing with other people to a minimum to reduce risk of spreading the virus. Some clarification is required as to whether this unreasonable 'one shopper to one household' policy is company wide and the reasons why it has been introduced. As a weekly Aldi shopper myself since the first store opened in Rotherham, this incident has really made me sit up and reconsider whether I will continue to shop with them in future.",0,2

Aldi UK,Choose another supermarket if your thinking of ordering a food parcel,"I ordered an Aldi food parcel on 18 April for my elderly parents who have been shielding for the last 8 weeks and despite numerous lengthy telephone calls to Aldi and Emails to Aldi and Hermes (the courier) I have today been informed by Hermes the food parcel has been ‘lost In transit’. Aldi’s website suggests that food parcels are prioritised, but the company appears to have no understanding of whether this timescale is being met. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am, the parcel had been ordered to help to get my parents through a few days without the need for me to physically have to go shopping for them.When I called Aldi today, I spoke to two people who were working from home. The first a young lad who sounded like he was sat on a couch and clearly couldn’t be bothered to deal with my enquiry. The second lady was quite unsympathetic and cut me off!!!!! The 3rd person I spoke to ‘Robbie’ Fully understood my disappointment and undertook to get the matter sorted today. Aldi has received a lot of good press about the introduction of its food parcels to help vulnerable people at this difficult time and which for some could be a ‘lifeline’ but don’t be tempted to order because going on my experience you might not actually receive it.",0,1

Aldi UK,One very dissatisfied Aldi customer,"If you want a serious recommendation from someone who has many years of experience with online purchasing then please find another supplier where you have decent customer service to help sort out any issues. Unfortunately my experience of ordering online from Aldi has turned out to be one big mistake for me. They seem to be very naive when it comes to organising a mail order service and I haven’t experienced such poor service from any other big brands quite like these. I ordered several items for delivery, and meeting their minimum order value for free delivery, I didn’t for one moment expect the order to be split between three separate couriers. For the first delivery I received a text message confirming the delivery time window. I arranged for someone to be home to accept it. The delivery was subsequently missed because they delivered outside of the agreed time. The carton was dumped with a neighbour in an open and damaged condition. The second delivery was a repeat of the first with missed delivery window. The second delivery also came damaged but we were not to know about this until several weeks later when we came to open and use it. Both cases I reviewed on their website but they moderated them as they didn’t meet their guidelines, ie they don’t allow bad reviews. They obviously are using the cheapest of couriers who don’t care much about meeting delivery expectations.",0,1

The selection is spot on and and I reckon there is enough in that box for a whole week's meals apart for me personally I would need some extra milk but that is not a problem. I can easily ask someone to get some milk but it is very difficult to ask someone one doesn't know to do a whole shop.I thank Aldi so much! But PLEASE anyone who does not need to shield please collect your own food We have been waiting 4 weeks without being able to get a delivery because all the slots are taken up by people who do not HAVE to isolate.

We arrived in time for the advertised 7.30am opening for over-70s, and had a very bad experience, as follows:1. We had to wait until 7.40 to be let into the store.2. Inside the store, staff were still loading shelves and most of them made no attempt to observe social distancing from us.3. In one place, a loading pallet had been left in such a position that it was impossible for me to pass it with a trolley without pushing it aside. 4. At the same place, a staff member obstructed my wife's progress with his loading pallet, and rebuked her for impatience when she tried to move to a safe distance away from him.5. Although Aldi’s website says that stores are open in Scotland to over-70s for making purchases, a notice on the door said that it was open only for browsing, and the till did not in fact open until 8.00.We chose to use Aldi because of the Covid-19 provisions advertised on the website, and we found that they are not honouring these undertakings.

Aldi UK,Rude member of staff,"I've always given aldi in brecon fantastic reviews over the years. I have been a customer from their first day of opening and the staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble. Until today when I was shouted at and threatened with being put out of the store, just because after being shouted at outside the store to stand back I asked if another sign could be put on t h e floor so everyone knew where to stop. The assistant was so rude to me threatening to put me out of the store for complaining, I was asking for a sign not complaining, and when I said I would complain to the manager about his attitude he told me he was the manager. Well Matthew whatever your surname is, you need customer care training as you do not deserve to work for this fantastic branch of Aldi.",0,5

Aldi UK,Aldi - best shop around!,"I decided to contact a staff member who works at Aldi before making a trip in, as I didn’t want to go out if stocks were low, or if it was busy during COVID-19. They advised that it was fairly quiet at that time, and that stocks were good - so I dashed in. I was very pleased to find all the social distancing markers outside the store, and in every aisle once I got in. They also had a table with antibacterial spray to clean trolleys/baskets upon entry. It was so reassuring to see the fresh produce in good stock. I was able to make the most out of my trip out. The service at Aldi, Hampton Peterborough cannot be faulted. Every time I go, I’m bound to find a good bargain. But, also very friendly staff who are always ready to help.Thank you to all the key workers out there! You are doing an incredible job and we all appreciate it. 👍🏻🌈🍇🥚🍎🥦",1,5
Aldi UK,There's always one rotten egg !!!,"Well what a difference a couple of weeks makes in the Armthorpe store. Today I went in and the disinfection area with paper and anti bacterial cleaner with a notice was removed so couldn't clean my basket. As I wasn't getting much just picked up 4 items in my arms and headed to checkout. I was shouted at to pick up a basket so she would let me put them in after she scanned them. This despite me saying my carrier bag was open and ready to put 4 items straight in. It took longer to do it her way !! I mentioned that she wasn't one of the usual staff who have always treated me kindly saying a cheery hello and asking how I was. No such pleasantries with this one. She replied she was the Manager !!!! Thank goodness her staff don't treat customers like she did with me. I asked when this new rule came in as yesterday I wasn't asked to do this. She then had the cheek to say ""we do ask customers not to come in on a daily basis"".....perhaps if I had a car to load up a week's worth of shopping I wouldn't need to come a few times a week. I have to carry my shopping home so can't do a big shop. Absolutely disgusted with this manager. She needs a reprimand from head office and a class in how to show respect.",0,1
Aldi UK,I ordered some garden furniture,"I ordered some garden furniture, and ordered the wrong colour. I rang up within 5 minutes to cancel that order, to which I got told it was cancelled and I would receive a full refund within 48 hours. My wife the same morning then ordered the correct colour furniture. 48 hours soon passed with no refund, to which I again rang up and got told I had been told wrong information and that they have cancelled it with the delivery company, and they need to accept that cancellation. Long story short, my furniture got delivered to which I refused, and then they tried a further 2 more times to re deliver! On the last attempt to deliver they simply wouldn’t let me refuse it! I then got back on the phone to aldi and they arranged a pick up for this item to be returned. Low and behold the delivery company never turned up! In the end I have had to sell this furniture set at a reduced price of my own accord to get some of my money back, as this was pushing 3 weeks awaiting my refund. I won’t be ordering again from Aldi’s website as it seems those on the phones don’t really know what they are doing. Also, I really do think that in the future they really need to find a new delivery company, and not just go for the cheapest option. Xpd delivery company are the worst company I have ever dealt with. The 2 men who delivered my furniture and wouldn’t take it back made my wife cry with how disgusting they were. My wife’s order also took over 2 weeks to be delivered as xpd kept delivering my item and not my wife’s order. I feel that if my cancelled order was actually cancelled and refunded within the time scale, I wouldn’t have been writing this but it’s been an absolute farce from the beginning. How on earth can an order not be cancelled 5 mins after placing it??? I’m really annoyed I’ve had to sell it myself as i simply don’t have the trust in Aldi or xpd to get my cancelled order back to aldi for a refund. Aldi, you really need to address your delivery company and find a new honest and reliable service.",0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi Mellor St Rochdale Bullying Staff,"Aldi, Mellor St, Rochdale. I have never previously had any problems with the staff in this store. However, today I had three items in a basket which I duly placed on the conveyor and found nowhere to put the basket. I was told that I had to keep the basket and put my purchases into it to which I responded that there was no need as I had a reusable bag. I then placed the basket in the packing area at which point the person on the till told me that I had to keep hold of it due to the rules. What rules?? For what reason?? And, where are these ‘rules’ situated in order to inform customers of said rules?? I advised there was no difference between my putting the three items into a carrier bag and putting them (unnecessarily) into a shopping basket and then loading them into the same plastic bag. The individual on the till responded in an extremely arrogant manner that that was the rule and not to come back to the store!!!!What on earth is going on?The lockdown will not last forever. As such, businesses allowing staff to behave in such a manner towards their clients can only be described as very short sighted. There are many more supermarkets in Rochdale that are just as easily accessible and equally as competitively priced. Staff should be providing the same level of customer service during the pandemic as they were before it. It’s a stressful and unpleasant time for everyone. That said, bullying customers should not be regarded as acceptable at ANY time. If staff have a problem with that then they are in the wrong job and should be dismissed or seek an alternative profession elsewhere.",0,1

Going Into the store distance was kept but as soon as you were in the store it was a free for all no social distancing, I just feel another company not looking after staff or customers. Therefore I would not recommend shopping in there and would most definitely not shop in there again after this is all over. Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s are a much safer option without a doubt.",0,1

They state this is to keep customers and staff safe, this is rubbish. They are only allowing a reduced total number of people in their shop and want all the people in the shop spending money.50 single people shopping (= 50 trolleys) will probably spend more than 50 couples (= 25 trolleys). Why don’t they say this instead of using the pandemic as an excuse to try to sell more in reduced opening times?

Aldi UK,Rude Staff,"I have been shopping in the Paisley, Fulbar Road branch of Aldi since it first opened over 20 years ago and have never had any cause for complaint. However, on 9th April 2020, during the global pandemic, I visited for some shopping which, as a senior citizen, only amounted to a small basket for me. The system that was being used was that there was one queue, stretching around the store, which was understandable given the circumstances, so I didn't mind waiting. After about 20 minutes or so, I reached the front. There were 3 tills open, numbers 1, 3 and 5. The staff member on till 1, who was 'managing' the queue instructed me to go to till 3 and stand behind the lady who was already there (at a safe distance of course), which I did. A couple of minutes later, the same staff member shouted at me that I shouldn't be there, as only one person was allowed at a time and that I should join the queue that I had already waited in for so long. I told him that he had told me to wait at till 3, which he denied, even though the lady in front had also heard him and also told him so. He kept shouting that I shouldn't be there. By this time I felt totally embarrassed, humiliated and close to tears, as this all took place in front of a store full of customers, who could hear everything. I was close to just leaving my small basket of shopping and walking to Asda instead, but by this time, the woman in front was being attended to, so I stayed put. As I said, I've never had any complaint about this branch of Aldi in all the years I've been using it, but my recent experience has made me reluctant to shop there again.",0,2

Aldi UK,Aldi deputy managers arrogance,I called at Aldi supermarket yesterday 8/4/20 with my son who lives at home with me for my one day a week shop I abide by the government guidelines and we don't go out any other time.We waited in a queue for 30 mins I totally agree with the social distancing and everybody in the queue were adhering to this when I got to the front the lady staff member said only one of you is allowed to do the shop I explained to her I need my son with me to help me shop I am waiting for a back operation and cannot lift she called to another staff member a man who approached and reiterated the same I tried to explain he said go home and get proof I said I have been waiting all this time and all I want is to do my shop and I'm not leaving until I've done it I asked for the manager he said I am the manager (he was the deputy manager)and then said you don't have to shop here he then said give your son I list and let him do it I said I can't do that he has mental health problems and wouldn't know what to get I then said I'll let my son wait at checkout and I'll struggle round and my son can lift it all on then anyway the manager had overheard this and came to me and said I had been shouting I explained why and he said I'll allow it this once I carried on with my son shopping and when I got home I phoned Aldi head office customer services they were totally sympathetic and said it shouldn't have happened and would be contacting the store on Barnsley road at Doncaster and also said they are following government guidelines but it is at the store's discretion in certain circumstances to allow people in together who need help but he shouldn't have been as he was.i had to give one star to do the review but I actually give none Aldi get your act together.Im adding more to this review because although Aldi were sympathetic over the phone I've had no letter of apology and they said it would be dealt with internally meaning nothing why are certain shops not allowing 2 people in together contravening the government I went to Lidl since that happened in Aldi explained to there manager why I needed my son with me totally different response and she had a back operation and new what I was going through didn't argue and allowed me to shop in peace with my son I won't be going to Aldi ever again poor response altogether.,0,1

Aldi UK,I visited Aldi once,"I visited Aldi once. I couldn’t believe prices were so low! I bought a lot and spent 50% less money than usual, but I have to say quality of some items was rather low. I guess saying “you get what you pay for” makes perfect sense in this case. I don’t appreciate that Aldi’s products have almost identical packaging as other branded products, which is a typical psychological trick. However I think it’s great option for people on very low budget.I will be going back at some point, but I will just be more careful with what I buy.",0,3

Then got refused in the store because I have a child (only one per household according to the manager) and was taking to my sister with less then 2 metres away from each other.

Aldi UK,Appalling Coronavirus Management,"The Coronavirus management in your Sittingbourne store yesterday was appalling, the store was packed with customers & there were queues from the front to the back of every aisle. My wife works for the NHS & thought she would use the allocated time slot for key workers. When she arrived at the store there was no management of this scheme & it was in fact a free for all. There was no restriction of people entering the store or social distancing by the management & even your staff were complaining there were to many people in store. When my wife asked a manager why there was no social distancing rules in place, he simply said it was the customers responsibility to stand the necessary distance apart, which is fine apart from the hoards interrupting the queues to get to the produce. She also asked why so many customers were allowed into the store at one time & was duly told “it was because of the NHS workers!!” He obviously saw this scheme as an inconvenience & made my wife feel guilty for shopping at this time. We had visited another supermarket the previous day to get provisions for our elderly parents & found an orderly, controlled procedure in place for entry, paying & exit, they even sanitised the trolley handles before use. We felt safe & cared for & although Aldi has been our supermarket of choice for many years we feel that a return to the larger more customer considerate outlets are the way forward for us now. The few extra pounds we may have to pay is well worth it for our health & safety",0,1
Aldi UK,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Disgusting customer service to the elderly. 0stars if possible.My mother and rather are in isolation. I as a key worker have had to leave my baby boy with them in order to support the UK. She placed an order online over two week plus for the baby. Aldi stated 5-10 working days for delivery.My poor mother phoned up yesterday only to receive a disgusting response from a young female, whom stated no she's didn't give a toss about my mother's query.1. Since when do you employ trash to speak to anyone like that? My mother is elderly not rubbish under this women's foot. 2. Your firm is at fault, not my poor mother. Why did she receive such level of abuse. 3. Where is the parcel she paid quite alot for. My baby is going without because of this. I provide a high level of support to all transport to ensure all of your supplies get into the country and make it to your stores. In return maybe you can employ trained staff, with a ounce of respect for the elderly.NOW WHERE IS HER PARCEL ??? In addition to the above, all calls were recorded and I do believe in righting the system. I will happily put the recording online this week, to show how Aldi treat the elderly.

Aldi UK,Don’t shop in Aldi,"I went to the Aldi store in Hounslow this afternoon and was stopped at the door by the security , to be asked if I was related to a lady who went in the store before me. I confirmed we weren’t related and that I did not know who she was. I asked why I was the only person to be stopped for questioning. The security was very dismissive and said because she had. I advise that was not a reason and that she was racial profiling and although our appearances were similar as we both wore a headscarf for religious reasons and had the same skin colour, it did not mean we were related. Once inside I asked the security lady if I can speak to the Store Manager, to get an answer . She went to get him from the office and he came out in anger and walked so close to my face I nearly fell backwards trying to avoid him to keep a safe distance. I advised him of what had happened at the door and the security guards assumption , he asked me to leave the shop and said he would not deal with me and denied me any service. Meanwhile, wondering what I had done wrong, except ask for an explanation,3 members of staff began to surround me like a bunch of hyenas shouting at me to leave , I kept asking them to give me a safe distance as they were all too close to me. As I left the shop they mocked me and taunted me by waving bye and telling me to go complain.I’m so disgusted with their behaviour that I will never step foot in that shop ever again.This experience has left me feeling extremely vulnerable and scared of contamination of COV19 as a result if their conduct today.",0,1

Aldi UK,TURNED AWAY WITH A DISABILITY DURING COVID-19,"went to Aldi in Sale 4th April and waited in the queue with a vulnerable adult with mental health issues who I care for. We were there to shop for both of us and an 80yr old lady I also care for. We got to the front of a short queue to be told we couldn't go in together with a trolley. I can't leave the vulnerable adult alone either in a car or at home and i shouldn't have to explain mental health issues to a security guard its too stressful just leaving the house and feeling vulnerable in a supermarket as a person with extreme mental health issues without being confronted by a bigoted security guard on a power trip.Im sure he doesn't like to be judged for his face and neck tattoos, people with mental health issues shouldn't be singled out either or have to explain their issue.You wouldn't have turned away someone in a wheelchair or asked them what their disability is. DISABILITIES ARE NOT ALWAYS VISIBLE! i should be simply able to say that we MUST shop together and not have to spell it out. Really disgusted at Aldi bigotry.",0,1
Aldi UK,Poor Choice of Carrier,"My review is not aimed at the quality of the products that I ordered online but more so the ineptness of Aldi's chosen carrier, Hermes and the farcical approach to resolving what is blatantly a shoddy service.I ordered tools, to the value of just over £30.00, dispatched by Aldi March 24, delivered by Hermes March 27 to wrong address. I did not need to leave any special delivery instructions as for the past 3 weeks I have remained at home due to family health issues, but we are Covid free. It is claimed by the carrier Hermes through their online portal that my goods had been delivered to a neighbor and the term Covid 19 and the name and address of a lady at a dwelling more than a quarter of a mile away had received the goods.I contacted Aldi by email, still no response, subsequently by phone, spoken to 3 difference people on 3 different days, they are all saying that I must wait until Aldi has had a response from Hermes before they can give a refund or replace the goods. Aldi have done checks, they can see that Hermes are Totally at fault, but farcically I must wait for Hermes to contact Aldi.I have now lost all respect for Aldi, I might add, I do respect the individuals that I have spoken to, they are doing their job in difficult times and only following orders. Hermes, I'll make a separate post about them, needless to say it will be far from complimentary.",0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi Portsmouth,"My visit today at Aldi was good regarding products availability and the store in general, however at check out the cashier was very rude and made me fell unwelcome. First, there was one item on the floor that didn't belonged to my shopping and when I gave back to her she asked me if I didn't want the product anymore. I had to repeat myself saying that the item was not from my basket, she then stormed off to put the item back without saying anything to me.While I was waiting, I started putting the items that were scanned in my bag instead of doing nothing while waiting for her to come back.A few minutes after, on her return while finishing scanning the remaining items from my cart, she then tells me that the shop has a designated packaging area and that I shouldn't have put the scanned items in my bag while waiting for her?! I'm aware of the packing area and how the system work at Aldi, I haven't done anything wrong as a customer and I refuse to leave the house on the current situation to be treated like that. The customers before and after me received a different treatment and from my point of view, she was being racist.",0,1
Aldi UK,Rude Beyond Belief,"Unfortunately you are restricted to having to give one star....I would have preferred to have given a large zero. Wife went into the local Aldi in Wakefield and was very rudely spoken to by the cashier insisting that she was not allowed to leave two out of three heavy items in the shopping trolley and just scan the one on the conveyor - she was also told she was not allowed to use the trolley to pack the shopping and to do it elsewhere. It was explained that she had never had this problem before, had often been told to leave multiple identical items in the trolley and they would simply multiply the scanned item accordingly and also pointed out the other till points that were allowing the customers the same facility and packing the trolley at the till. Unbelievably, the cashier (rude early 20's female) shouted across to the adjacent till operator (offensive early 20's male) and told him to ""stop letting customers packing their shopping cos this woman is kicking off about it"" (although wife wasn't in fact ""kicking off"" about it but merely demonstrating parity).....to which the offensive male till operator shouted ""if she gives you any **** then refuse to serve her and she can go elsewhere"".... nice. What's even worse - called the customer services team and spoke to a lady who appeared to be very concerned, apologetic and said that she would investigate matters and we would be contacted by a manager within 24 hrs to discuss the complaint - guess what???....we are still waiting. Shocking Aldi...shocking. I appreciate that everyone may be under a bit of pressure and stress due to the current circumstances with CV but none the less...shocking.

Aldi UK,Excellent Shopping Experience At Aldi Poynton Cheshire,"Visited Aldi in Poynton last thursday and today to do the weekly shop. Yes, people were waiting outside 2m apart and it was quite a long queue. However, after about 10 minutes I was in the store. I dont think that is a long time when safety is concerned. Inside, the vast majority of shelves were stocked (even pasta and loo rolls!!!!). the staff putting out stock were really helpful when I asked for directions for a couple of items. At the checkout there was excellent signage and 2m labels on the floor.very good screening between operators and customers. One member of staff was directing people to the aisle with the least number of people waiting. Checkout staff were friendly and professional, even though they must have some concerns regarding their own safety. the whole shop probably took 15 minutes longer than normal but also a heck of a lot more relaxing as most customers were very courteous and not rushing around. i hope that if Aldi management read this review they will pass on my thanks to ALL the staff.",0,5
Aldi UK,Disregard for customers,"Aldi claims they limit the purchase of items to a maximum of 4 units, to stop panic buying and ensure a fair chance for all customers. This has proven to be blatantly untrue when I visited Aldi store at 232 Addington Road, Selsdon on 27th March 2020.I was pleased to see plenty of baked bean cartons on shelf at two levels. When I went to get some, the shopper in front of me started loading his trolley with whole cartons, and emptied the shelf in presence of store staff, .Another shopper, pointed out what was happening to a staff member who did nothing to stop. The purchase went ahead with the approval of the store manager!I was quite angry as well as disgusted. Later, a complaint to Aldi Customer Services yielded the ‘revelationary’ response “It shouldn’t have happened”. YOU DON’T SAY!Furthermore, although the queue control was in compliance with ‘social distancing’ guidelines, there were no hand sanitation provided and there was no one sanitising the trolley handles! I suppose profit is more important than customer safety!",0,1

My husband and I have to drive in one car and therefore went together to Aldi. My husband needed to shop for his elderly parents who are housebound and I have to shop for our family. This happened between 4pm and 4:30pm on the 1st April when your member of staff at the door decided to assault us by talking down to us like we were criminals. He was accusing us of coming to the front of the store together. My husband tried to explain that we need to shop separately for different families, but just came together. A member of staff refused my husband entry saying that one person per trolley. We said that this is not a problem - we will shop separately like any other customers, since we need things for two different households. He became very defensive, and his attitude was absolutely unacceptable in the current circumstances. He did not want to listen to anything we have to say, that we need to buy groceries for people who unable to shop for themselves. His behavior was disgraceful. I feel sorry for volunteers who have to experience these assaults at the door probably on a daily basis. This was my last visit to any Aldi stores for certain.",0,1

She was speaking as if we were trash, not customers. As I moved my cart forward, the same shop person was standing in front of some cat food I needed.

And told me that i could just leave the store!! Well, I'm not sure who she was talking to as i was the only one standing there. So i said again...I need to get something behind you. She again said what do you want in a very loud anger filled voice. I told her then that i wanted the cat crunchies, and she yelled back, how many. I told her four and she gets four and hands them to my husband. Well all the yelling she did about social distance went right out the window!! I again asked her why she was being so rude, and she said go check out and leave the store. I did notice her name as Charlotte and called her by name. I did ask for the manager and was told his name is Matt, but he was on the floor somewhere. We always shop at this Aldis in Skipton, but we will never go again.

Aldi UK,Extremely rude store colleague,"I just want to say I am very disappointed with the level of service I have received in my local Aldi store this evening.Now I am not usually the one to complain however this is a must!Gateshead Metrocentre 25/03/20 approx 18:50The store advisor who served me at the till is apparently a deputy manager according to family members.He had no name badge on however he was a black gentleman with short black hair, unsure on height as he was sitting down, he looked like he was in his late 30’s.I just want to say overall I was taken back and so shocked by the way in which he spoke to myself and the way in which I was treated as a customer. The store colleague was extremely rude and clearly has ZERO customer service skills. He doesn’t even look at you or pass you the receipt you have to take it yourself from the printer. He certainly has no people skills!Further more you have him representing your store as a deputy store manager? Really!?!?He should be setting an example not letting the team down. I am literally taken back by the service I have just received, I am usually someone who would say something there and then if I wasn’t happy, however It was so unexpected in a Aldi store, everyone is usually really friendly and helpful.I strongly recommend you take this complaint seriously as I understand your staff are under pressure at the moment however after speaking to other family members tonight they have said they have received a similar service for this gentleman aswell and it is completely unacceptable.Yes he maybe a deputy manager but that is no excuse, you will lose customers if he continues and he should definitely be retraining or offered an alternative position that isn’t customer facing.If I am treated the same way again I will take great pleasure in showing him up in front of his customers waiting behind myself at the tills.",0,1
Aldi UK,aMazing meatless meatballs,"Let’s set the scene. Day two of coronavirus quarantine and you’ve had it rough. Spent an hour and a half slaving away on the stove to make a top notch smorgasbords for your hungry family of 6. You set down the food and in walks the grey squirrel of the family, having shortly returned from a 2nd rate university. She hungrily makes a grab for a chicken pesto bite and tears into it, forgetting her sworn allegiance to vegetarianism. “Emily! Those have chicken in them!” Exclaims mother. Emily spits out the bite disgustingly and turns to the oozing, meaty sausage rolls.“Is this vegetarian?” She ask gingerly. “No, it’s a SAUSAGE roll you swine”Emily gasps indignantly and waste no second to accuse the Cinderella of this story, myself who had slaved at the stove, at the lack of veggie bites at this feast. I winced in pain thinking of all the blood, sweat and tears put in to feed this family. I run to the utility room to hide my tears. I rummaged in the freezer in the vain I would find a veggie delight and when all seemed lost, they appeared like an oasis in a desert. I wasted no time delicately oven roasting these glorious gold nuggets of veggie delight. The meatless meatballs soaked in the tears of my joy were set on the table. The balls were set on the table no more than five seconds before the hoards of Devonians, rife with cabin fever, came barrelling down our street waiting, fruitlessly, for a single of these heaven-like meatless meatballs.All in all, a highly successful meal. 10/10 would buy again. Well done Aldi you’ve done us all proud",0,5

I passed them and went get some toilet paper where all drama happened. The same women come over with stuff on the pallet and said to me “MOVE” because she will be unloading products. I said to her please don’t be rude and I’ve seen you already shouting to another customer who offer you a help. She went furious after heard what I said and bring over security guy to remove me from the shop because I’m arguing and I’m rude! What a nonsense and lack of professionalism from staff of Aldi shop. This person should be removed from her position or even work for her behaviour especially in time whe we fight Coronavirus and everyone try to stay calm and safe.

Aldi UK,"SELFISH ALDI CUSTOMERS, PATHETIC '4 OF EVERYTHING' RULE","Don't know where these good reviews come from, our local Aldi store in Wellington, Telford have severe shortages on their shelves when we go, and we are retired so go at quietest times (Wednesdays). The last 3 weeks have been hell, the main problem is they are letting customers have 4 of everything. It doesn't take much working out to see that people are coming into the store with a trolley each (same family), getting 4 packs of 9 toilet rolls, so for a couple they are allowed to buy 72! Come on Aldi, do your maths! No store assistants to be found, finally dragged someone out and asked him why they never have any, he said 'they've all gone'. Well, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to work that one out!!!!He said they order their usual quota, but only get half of what they order????? I phoned Aldi Head Office, they said their stores are getting their usual orders fulfilled (????) and it's mindless selfish people buying extra to stock up. Well, when they made the '4 of everything' rule, can you tell me when till operators have ever seen a customer buy 4 x 9 packs of toilet rolls on a normal week? Obviously not!! I'm sorry but this is totally ridiculous! You know what he also said - he told me some people are going back in to get more until their boot is full. Well, all I can say is what the critical care nurse said when she got so upset after doing that 48 hour shift caring for Covid-19 sufferers - you need to STOP IT NOW!",0,2

Aldi UK,I got a car park fine on 08/03/2020 for…,"I got a car park fine on 08/03/2020 for exceeding 18 minutes (ParkingEye Ref Number:484548/576405) at Aldi Grays store at London Road in Essex. I spoke to the local store manager (Nikki), he has supported me for appeal to ParkingEye to highlight existing poor situation at the store but, it was deemed unsuccessful by ParkingEye. I felt it is really unfair and outrageous. I was a royal Aldi customer for the past 10 years, I used Aldi for entire family food supply as my main visit store. I usually visit Aldi at weekend only. On the day I have visited two store (Aldi and Poundstretcher next to it), in recent years this store has since become more like a World War Two place especially in the weekend, and seems just getting worst! There was over crowded customers fighting for car park, arguing, unbelievingly long queue at every check-out till, no shopping trory available, and many cars were queuing to get out from one same entry and exit point over to the T-crossing bi-directional very busy main road in order to get out.The point is the counting time for parking stay duration ended at exit gate only if you are able get out fast from the long queuing cars in front of you only. When you have more than 3 cars in front of you trying to get out and over to this very busy main road, your parking time clock would run out exceeding the 90 minutes very easily with no chance to avoid such car park fine. If you look at the store parking infrastructure and surrounding design, where only one same car entrance and exit points during the busy weekend or at any time, sometimes there could be a big Aldi truck also going in or parking up using this entrance/exit point, it is a big safety hazard to anyone passing/walking passed you with or without a pushing a trory dangerously.The store has seemed to ignore customer's safety on site instead, but continue to fine parking charge unreasonably without any business sense. I have highlighted this to ParkingEye for such appeal but no one seemed to want to improve customer's safety but only interested to fine parking to maximise store profis only shamefully. This is really unjust and unacceptable I personally find it a very disgusting act!",0,1

How will this work if one of us has to go out every other day for supplies. Isn't this more risky for everyone? Especially for the elderly and people with serious health problems. More people shopping every day and spreading the virus. I know people who have several pets and this is unrealistic. 4 tins wouldn't last the week. Please be more realistic with your numbers.,0,2

When i told her that it was not much to ask for she said she would not have humiliated us by putting things back in trolley and putting on other one as it would have been quicker to do. She does have an attitude. However its not her place to commentIts a shame as the attitude of one staff puts a damper on the rest who care.

Why are the Parent and Child spaces always full of cars belonging to rude middle aged people who don’t so much as have a car seat in their vehicles let alone a child? Anyone who has ever tried to get a car seat / baby out of a ‘normal’ parking space knows how difficult this is. Why are these spaces not properly marked?

Years ago, when I first set foot in a store in Huddersfield, I noticed some of the cooked meats were discoloured. I put that down to an individual store issue and just didn't buy meat from there. Yesterday, I was in the Prestwick store and was about to get a pack of beef mince, but thought better of it, as half of the packs in the fridge contained beef mince which was almost completely brown and dried up. Unfortunately, no staff members were around to mention it to, and the till staff were in too much of a hurry to strike up a discussion. It concerns me that staff don't seem to notice that produce is visibly 'off'.",0,3

Aldi UK,I've shopped at Aldi for 30n years now…,I've shopped at Aldi for 30n years now and am still happy with the products otherwise I'd have given a lower score. I shop at ramsbottom and since the last manager was transferredthe service from this store has deteriorated. Check out staff think its ok to talk amongst themselves and I've been kept waiting before now whilst the woman went off without saying a word. This morning I had to wait an unacceptable time during which the checkout was talking to a woman she obvously knew. She was still scanning (slowly) but kept stopping. The man man behind me gesticulated with his hands.(yakety yak) Not the first time this has happened with different staff.,0,3
Aldi UK,My receipt showed I had been overcharged Check your receipt,"My receipt showed I had been charged again for some salmon.

When I went over to the other cashier, the rude one followed me snatched the receipt from me and proceeded to explain the receipt to the 2nd cashier. The 2nd cashier pointed out the mistake to the first one and gave me my money back. No apology , nothing. Check your receipts. I found another error for 14.99 that I had been overcharged. Too upset to go back.",0,1
Aldi UK,Don't get sucked into the hype,"Out of all the supermarkets, Aldi is my least favourite. They are such scammers with their highly misleading advertising about saving more by shopping there instead of other supermarkets. If you look closely in the adverts they are comparing things like their own brand corn flakes with Kellogg's cornflakes from another supermarket. Of course a supermarket own brand is going to be cheaper than the leading brand. They wouldn't dare compare it like for like with other supermarket own brands as for a lot of items they aren't cheaper at all. The choice is often so small with the products they do sell that if you don't like it you can't get an alternative. I love breaded fish, but just not Aldi's breaded fish that has Durum wheat as an ingredient. It tastes disgusting compared to other bread fish at every other supermarket. There's no alternative in store though. They don't list all their products online. The full special buy ranges can only be seen in store which could result in a wasted journey. They are too lazy to put each weekly leaflet online for people to see. It wouldn't take a few minutes to do. Till staff are quiet and rush you through like you are just walking profits and not a human being. No bakery and the bread they sell is usually very short dated with just one or 2 days left until it's BBE date. Terrible.",0,1

A woman called me with a very broad Scottish accent and said ""I'm calling about the item YOU bought"" by the time I had processed what she had said she was onto the next sentence and I didn't correct her. The battery charger and battery were available online that very day. She repeated that I had purchased the saw again in her goodbye wishes by this time I had, had enough of trying to process her accent and just wanted to get rid of her. I did not appreciate that she was either saying I was dishonest about my niece or she had,t even bothered to read my mail, both unacceptable.",0,1

Aldi UK,Peel Centre Blackburn,"Treated like filth today at Aldi 12/02/2020 till no 1 by a blonde cashier no name tag at about 15:50. ok some context. An elderly shopper had started unloading her trolley and as I had a basket she graciously said I can go first( lovely lady more customer service than the whole Blackburn store combined). Ok its gets to my turn, because of the limited space on the belt I had to put the basket on it no space to pack out the goods. The cashier tells me next time to pack out me basket in a stroppy tone. I explained to her the reason for we I put the basket on the belt, but I felt I did not need to be reprimanded for it. So now I am seething inside and I pay for the shopping and she still goes on and tells me to put the basket back as if I am some sort of slave. In disgust I leave chucking a spare plastic bag on the floor in protest she screams excuse me excuse me I storm out of the store and have lost me bank card as well because of this whole situation. Food I bought is misshapen as well because of my anger while packing my bag will never ever set foot in that place again.

The plastic is not that strong, the backs of the cabinets is made of corrugated , plastic, and is very flimsy.i will not be ordering or shopping with Aldi again.The best part was, when I came to return the products they could not find my orders.

Very clear that pricing and company buyer changes driven by cost saving have seen inferior quality items now being stocked.

On Christmas eve I recall going to purchase some goods, and the Indian gentleman whom was checking my goods out was so rude to me, he had asked me for a bag of which I replied with a yes, somehow his def ears did not hear me so he sort of shouted at me asking if I wanted a bag as If I did not hear him the first time, I had replied the first time but that was not my fault he did not hear me. Just rude and quite frankly not the English way of doing things. That was my Christmas eve ruined.There have been a few other times with similar behavior. I understand that Aldi is the trash of trash stores but that does not give way to employees to be equally trashy. My suggestion is that they hire a coach at Aldi stores to teach some of those septic and vile employees how to conduct themselves in the face of customers.

Aldi UK,sore,walked into aldi in kilmarnock with my grandfather age 73 that fought in the war. as we entered the building the manager asked both of us our age and as my grandfather said he was 73 the old corsa driving manager just asked us to follow him and i had to watch the manager and his boys tied him up to a chair and gave him a good old beating. i tried to chase the man but he got away in his corsa and speeded down the M8. all pensioners stay away from this place!,0,2
Aldi UK,I saw the online Aldi vegetarian range and tried it,"I saw the online ad for Aldi vegetarian range and was really impressed with the range and price. I tried the whole range from the freezer cabinet and the only complaint was that the sweet potato curry was too hot, but that is just me, the taste otherwise was lovely. Can definitely recommend and the Halloumi burgers were lovely and the fries. I found my bill to be able £20 cheaper than Tesco. The cannelloni pasta bake was really creamy. My only complaint was that the toilet rolls were way too thin and really useless and the rainbow salad bowl was just lettuce. Will definitely shop there again.",0,4

Aldi UK,Worse than bad!,I purchased an item from Aldi online in December 2019 for a gift. On opening it was found to be 3 MONTHS beyond bbe date. Despite repeated emails to customer services and even two directed to the CEO I am still waiting for an outcome. It was a small inexpensive item but my treatment by the company has been disgusting. They say they have not received my emails but I have had an automated response every time so that is not the case. They do not deserve my custom or anyone else's for that matter.,0,1

Aldi UK,I suppose most people only review when…,"I suppose most people only review when threre’s something they’re not happy with. I have no problem with staff at my local Aldi. I can see that they work very hard and they do their best to give good service. However because they are short staffed and the staff are always being moved around the store the shopping experience suffers.To get to the point, at my local Aldi the shelves are always half empty. I have tried shopping later in the day but often the shelves are still not restocked. Also the signs at the checkouts that tell you a new checkout will be opened are a joke. Often the queues reach half way down the shop. If you only have a few items this is particularly frustrating.There was a news item tonight that Aldi have made record profits over Christmas. In my opinion the Truro store is far too small for the catchment area. The aisles are too narrow and often it is not even possible to park in the car park. I was told that the staff are often sent home if management think that it will be a quieter day. If it gets busy, which more often it does then the staff are put on checkout and the shelves are empty.Finally it seems that the delivery only arrives around midday. This is far too late.I have been told that not all Aldi operate this way and that a new store is planned. However I have been hearing this for over five years.",0,2

Thought it was a beans thing and to be honest haven't eaten baked beans since from anywhere, it's totally put me off. Bought a jar of natural peanut butter from there today and opened it to find maggots floating in the top of the jar in the oil that had separated from the peanut butter. I was flabbergasted. Two different products with maggots in?? I'm now soooo put off shopping here which makes me so sad because I've generally loved the products and the price. Check your aldi beans before eating!

I quick look at the remaining queues confirmed that I would not have enough time, so I put my basket down, intending to pick up my shopping basket after the dentist, if was still there, or start again if they were quick in emptying it. As I was leaving, Kyle, the supervisor, stood up from the adjacent till and asked loudly for me to ""Open my bag please!"" I was mortified, but I complied, and he glanced in my carrier bag and allowed me to leave. I hesitated, expecting an apology, but none was forthcoming. I went back after the dentist to get an apology and complete my shop, but Kyle felt he had done nothing wrong. He said he had seen what had happened at the till, and I believe he called me to open my bag to deliberately embarrass me.

Tracking service kept changing arrival times and finally said 8pm-10pm delivery. Then it suddenly changed and said the driver has missed you, and left a card. Nonsense, as no driver came or left a card. He obviously just decided to finish his shift. So I rearranged delivery for Monday. Tracking said it would arrived between 8-10pm again. Waited. Then at 8:30pm the tracker showed that the driver was one drop away. Then it changed again to say that the driver left a card as no one was in. Rubbish, no driver called or left a card. Again, he just ended his shift. Tried to contact Yodel but they only have an automated service and you can’t speak to anyone. It said they would deliver after Christmas! Hopeless. Phoned Aldi who said they couldn’t do anything either. Offered to cancel whole order and send a £10 voucher which would come after Christmas. Unreliable, dishonest delivery service.

We shopped in Aldi first which is across the road and then Pets at a home only to find a parking Ticket had been issued immediately we had entered Aldi. We still purchased from Pets at Home as planned and within the 2 hour window offered. It is apparent now that whilst it is not advertised you have to relocate to each car park as you shop. Well kept secret! by both Stores. The Staff knew about the issue in Pets at Home but policy prevents customers being made aware and as far as the £60 Ticket is concerned their view was that the fault lies with UKPC. Pets at Home washed their hands of the problem. Aldi will also be fully aware of the situation but neither wish to attempt to alert their Customers. What a way to treat your customers!

They act like they have no time to stop they are nothing like staff at Sainsbury's the employees actually stop and become your personal assistant walk with you to find what you need and ask other employees if they don't know. But Aldi portslade a little tip as a customer you are there to help me and treat me as if I'm valued I spend my hard earn cash in your store and just because you give value for money on your limited product selection doesn't mean you can slack on customers service I rather pay extra for that personal touch from bigger store chains I walk out of Aldi feeling disrespected, disappointed, upset and then I don't go back for months Aldi if any of the more expensive corporate stores ever decide to lower there prices to match yours.

Aldi UK,Recent online order experience,"I recently ordered a stainless steel sectioned bin which arrived on Saturday 14th December in the afternoon. Unfortunately it was damaged slightly, I contacted customer services on Sunday 15th December and spoke a very polite and helpful young lady who advised I take it to my local store for a full refund, the money was back in my account on Monday 17th December. What a refreshing change. Best customer service I’ve ever had. Thank you Aldi.",0,5

Aldi UK,extremely disapointing service,"Extremely disappointed with service from Aldi. Ordered a luxury hamper as a gift and organised delivery to my uncles house. I wanted this to be surprise. After 10 days I called him to ask if he had received it. There was no sign of it all. I contacted Aldi customer services who assured me that it had been delivered. I checked the address with them and they had the wrong address. I was told that I must have entered the wrong address on the online form. This is hard to believe as it was a completely different address and postcode. They said it had been signed for, on asking what the signature was I was told it just read Delivery. Aldi were adamant they had delivered the hamper, had fulfilled their contract and were not prepared to help in any way. This was so frustrating and upsetting.Their only suggestion was I go to the address they delivered too and ask for it back.This meant a round trip of 100 miles. I was apprehensive but did go. Fortunately the couple who received it were wonderful and they had been trying to figure out how this package had been left in the rain on their back door step. Hermes had simply left it there. Aldi were not in the least bit interested.",0,1
Aldi UK,Had to use 1 star to be able to record…,"Had to use 1 star to be able to record my review. Placed 2 orders on the 10th Dec (No.1) and 15th Dec(No.2). Received details today the order No.1 would be delivered between 12.48- 2.48, 6 mins before end time I'm advised that Yodal the delivery company is having problems getting to me! No its because they can't use their Sat Nav or A to Z properly. Tried their webchat and they are as much use as a chocolate teapot, so went back to Aldi to assist them/Yodal with landmarks near my address that would help the courier. No good - so had to cancel both orders and request a refund. Maybe Aldi could give their customers the option to CHOOSE who they want as their courier as Yodal and Hermes are absolute crap as couriers. Now I will be out of pocket for up to 14 days, when Yodal decide to return the parcel. Aldi you let yourselves down by not giving the customer the choice or better still the option to supply further supporting delivery details.",0,1
Aldi UK,Avoid on line Aldi like the plague,Unfortunately I had to give one star. Aldi actually ratesa minus star. If anything goes wrong and you ring them beware as you will be talking to a robot. Whatever your problem they just trot out their script. They are unable to answer any question. Aldi took £100 for a hamper from my account on 30 September. It never arrived and has obviously been lost. I now have to wait until at least the middle of January for a refund. Maybe the shop ok but avoid on line like the plague.,0,1
Aldi UK,Absolutely shocking,"Absolutely shocking! I ordered a cot and it came two months late. However, not only did it come 2 months late but the box was completely bashed and broken and the cot had huge chips out of it! I phoned Aldi to come and collect it and twice now I have had to take a whole day of work for them to not even bother turning up to collect it despite emailing me the night before to remind me to be in! Going to end up having to take this further to get my money back which isn’t ideal as it’s Christmas and the cot was over £100! Furious doesn’t come close.",0,1

Aldi UK,Avoid ordering online!!!,"I ordered a Christmas jumper on the 4th December. On the 12th I received an email saying my parcel had been dispatched. Immediately after, I received another email stating that due to an error on ALDI’s behalf the jumper I have been sent may be a different design to the one I ordered and if I wish to get a refund I can return it in store or by post. No option to cancel the order and no further details to what has actually been sent to me. I have emailed their customer service about this but have not received a response. To make matters worse, they use Hermes and the tracking states the parcel has been delivered when it has NOT. So not only have I been sent an item that I didn’t even order, Hermes have said they have delivered it when I haven’t even received it. I fully believe they over sold the jumper I ordered and instead of being honest and telling me it wasn’t in stock, they have been lazy and just sent another item. And Hermes are just being Hermes and losing parcels. PLEASE AVOID ORDERING ONLINE FROM ALDI.",0,1

Three weeks & 4 calls to Aldi customer services in which we were assured it would collected by the Dagenham Merrielands store, it's still here. Does the lazy and incompetent manager of this store (who has failed to properly secure their trollies in the first place) not care that the environment and our community are being blighted because they can't do their job properly?

I explained this was a vulnerable person and was told it would be investigated. Contacted aldi again to find out if the investigation had been completed was then told it hadn't been investigated as the complaint isn't from the victim directly. I again explained the person is incapable of making the complaint and was then told they would not enter into any further discussion with me regarding this.Utterly disgusting. It seems they have committed no criminal offence but this is the most deplorable abuse of a vulnerable person by a company who turned over 12 billion pounds last year.

Aldi UK,Appalling website and photo products; even worst 'customer service',"Appalling photo gift website that took me hours to navigate around, upload and order my printed photo cushions. Only used Aldi as they were cheap. but you clearly get what you pay for!! I finally managed to place the order on the 26th of November. No updates on dispatch or arrival dates were sent or received. The personalised cushion covers arrived on the 4th of December and were of poor quality. There was a flaw in the material of one of the cushion covers which meant that where the photo had been printed over the top. the image had not taken in 2 places and was lifting. The care instructions I received with these were also in German. I tried to contact Aldi through their Contact Us function for almost an hour unsuccessfully and just could not submit despite NUMEROUS attempts. I gave up and used their Customer Services contact email address, explaining the problem and attaching photos. An automated response informed me that I would hear back within 48 hours. It is now the 10th, no response. Husband is now on the phone with them and has already spoken to three people and it has taken 24 minutes so far to try and resolve this in order that we get our cushion covers for Christmas. They won't let him speak to anyone and we have to send an email to the same address I have already sent and email and attachments to and got an automated response 'thank you for your email' as they claim there is nothing on their system. They are liars. Avoid!",0,1

They said they'd need to get the goods back from Yodel first. From the calls I'd made it was clear they were either not getting through to Yodel or possibly not contacting them at all.Then they cut off the call.

Aldi UK,Purchased frazers steak bakes a couple…,"Purchased frazers steak bakes a couple of days ago from aldi in kilmarnock. Was impressed by ingrediants of beef at 63%. Heated one to today the 6/12/19 and found it was a sickening experience . When i opened it up it looked like gravy had been spread like jam only thinner. Took them to the aldi and got a full refund. Why does trading standards not check things out. Manufacturers of such items can print anything they want regarding ingrediants and get away with it knowing nothing will happen. When the fine is given for false advertizing it is in fact aldi who gets fined as it was aldi who sold you the product, not frazers. Product should be withdrawn and other frazer products checked for accuracy of what there actually selling. Would you buy the product if it was 3% beef and 97% fat. i dont think so. It is aldi s responsability to do a check on food produce they plan to sell to the public not for customers like me to test things out for them.",0,1

I contacted customer services about the lack of hygiene and asked why, when Aldi sell antibacterial gel at their till points staff weren’t told to use this when necessary.

It soon became full and I saw a trolley outside I left the basket and ran outside only to see it being snatched up by a man. I went back in and complained to one of the check out staff she said she had 8 people complain already I asked her to call the manager who took so long to come another kind shopper saw my blight and gave me hers which meant her carrying her bags to her car!! I finished my shop and asked the check out staff what the manager had said and she said not a lot!!

Aldi UK,Order From Aldi Online At Your Peril !,"Order from Aldi online at your peril !Orders just sit there 'processing' - never dispatched, just 'processing'. One week goes by, then two weeks, so called 'customer service' who take days to reply, then send cut and paste nonsense instead of actually doing something. Will I ever get my stuff ? Who knows. It would have been quicker to order from a Chinese ebay seller than from Aldi - the quality would have been at least as good AND I'd have had some protection from bad sellers (like Aldi).I saw a few things in their DIY section of the website that I fancied ordering, but I'm so done at this point that there's no way in hell I'd ever order from them again. Right now I'm just short of a hundred quid down, with no clue when, if ever, my stuff will be dispatched.On the other hand, just to be fair, I must say that the staff at my local Aldi store are very nice and helpful, and the food is usually very good. They always open up tills if there's even the slightest queue, and it's pretty clean and tidy in there, and well lit (Morecambe central branch). By contrast there is a Morrisons next door that's just awful - it's like a place where staff go to die. It smells bad frequently, it's expensive and the food (especially the fruit and veg) is terrible - either hard and tasteless or already rotten, never the nice bit in between), and most of the staff look and act like they flipped a coin to see whether they would come to work or jump under a bus that morning.Conclusion: Aldi in store is great (in Morecambe at least), BUT order online and be prepared for frustration, disappointment and hassle by the bucket load, and be prepared to meet Aldi's infamous 'customer services' - you can read more about them in many other complaints here on trust pilot, as I just did.

This is not a bank problem, oringinally I complained to my bank and a helpful adviser rang me and explained clearly how the problem lay with Aldi. I would stop shopping there but as I am on a tight budget I can save quite a bit on my weekly shop. the bank adviser suggested using cash! what is the point in having online banking and bank cards, and with bank branches closing all over the place if banks are now telling you to use cash, plus, I would over spend if I used cash, I like to just spend exactly what I need.",0,2

He then checked with his Manager, same reply and sorry we cannot check stock in other stores on our system. Rang daughter who contacted Aldi Customer Services, three available in Worcester so off I went to the store less than a mile from my home. Item not on display so spoke to assistant, who did thorough search of bins and displays, (like I did 5 minutes before!). He said that there may be some in their stock room so went to check, negative so he confirmed with Manager - no stock. My conversation with the Manager was interesting, it seems their stock control system is ""often wrong because it can't be 100%"". Why bother having it then!No offer of help, despite a 75 year old disabled man standing in front of him explaining the item was needed for Saturday.We used Aldi and Lidl when living in Germany, different story there, couldn't be more helpful.

I have fed this back to Aldi, only to receive a refund for my purchase - but that's not very good when funnily enough, I wanted the items I had bought!My only fault with Aldi's customer service is that I have had to call them on three separate occasions to chase up my delivery for an update. At no point has anyone contacted me. With the final time resulting in a full refund, but only when I had called them and my parcel has apparently been returned back to Aldi, with no way of it being shipped back out to me and it's now sold out online :( So sadly - I will not use their online service ever again until they stop using XDP.",0,1

Aldi UK,Sent this to the CEO of aldi and…,"Sent this to the CEO of aldi and customer service complaints.....Dear Mr Hurley.On Saturday 16th November 2019, my 13 year old Daughter went to aldi in sudbury suffolk about 6pm and bought 1x 6 pack of aldi crisps and 1x 6 pack of aldi cola. She came home with these goods, and packed her overnight bag, and the crisps & cola that she had bought earlier, as she was staying at a friends house that night and taking them with her. I gave her £5 to get something for her dinner to have at her friends house. She left the house about 8pm, with her overnight bags and went back to aldi to get a pizza, cake and biscuits, to take to her friends house, who only lives minutes away from aldi's. My Daughter returned home about 8.10pm, with no bags, sobbing and very distraught. When she was in aldi's, she picked up the pizza etc, but after looking in her bag, she realised she had left the £5 I gave her, at home. So she left the pizza, cake and biscuits at the till and went to leave the shop to come home and get her money. Just as she was about to leave, a blonde assistant manager and a red-haired shop worker stopped her, and said they had been informed from another shopper that she had stolen goods from the store and put them in her bag. The red haired shop assistant then informed my 13 year old Daughter that she has been told to search through her bags. This said shop assistant then searched through my Daughters bags, when infact she should NOT have done that. Maddy should of been asked to empty her bags herself.My Daughter said she was so distressed, as she knew she hadnt stolen anything, she stood watching a complete stranger who was not even management of aldi's going through all her bags and emptying them.I'd also like to point out that this search was conducted INSIDE THE SHOP, RIGHT NEAR THE FRONT DOORS WHERE SHOPPERS COULD SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING. ALSO WITHOUT CONTACTING ME TO BE PRESENT, TO GIVE PARENTAL PERMISSION !!!While searching her bags, they obviously found the cola and crisps she had bought earlier and told her she had stolen them. My Daughter said she would go home, which is only minutes away and get the receipt for the cola and crisps she had purchased earlier. The 2 above staff told her she had to leave all her belongings at the store while she came home, including her phone! They did not attempt to contact me, or even ask my Daughter to get me to return with her.So, when my Daughter arrived back home about 8.10pm, crying and shaking, I was obviously extremely concerned. We found the receipt in the bin, and I went back to aldi with her. I was not very happy at all! I gave the assistant manager the receipt they required to prove she had indeed paid for the cola & the crisps , and had not stolen them! I asked if there was any evidence on the cctv cameras throughout the store to prove that my Daughter had stolen anything and to give them reasonable doubt?? They said ""NO""!I then spoke to the manager of the store who was extremely apologetic. He admitted that his staff should NOT of searched my 13 year old daughters belongs without me present , as she is a minor ,and certainly not in the shop, where people were still shopping. He was very embarrassed and helpful, but the shop worker and the assistant manager were not. All the assistant manager kept saying was that she was sorry! I now have a very upset, distraught Daughter. I telephoned customer service for aldi this morning. The gentleman told me that he had personally googled my question ""Can my child be searched without parental permission""? He said that it's a government law that anyone under the age of 18 years can be searched, if they themselves give permission. I have thoroughly researched this today, and it is only the police and schools that are both governing bodies and have done authority to search your child without you present, but ONLY with with very good reason. The police will not search inside your bags, they will ask you to do it. The gentleman at customer services also contacted Aldi sudbury suffolk store, to ask for the names of the Manager, the assistant Manager, and the red haired shop assistant for me to put into the said complaint. He kept me on hold while he did this, and when he came back on the phone, he told me that they had refused to give their names.My Daughter did not steal anything, and was made to feel extremely embarrassed as the shop was quite full of customers who could see and hear everything. I am now contacting watchdog and trading standards to assist me and my Daughter.The way the staff at Aldi Sudbury Suffolk dealt with this incident was utterly unacceptable. A child of 13 should not be searched by anyone in your store, without parental permission, and indeed not without their parent present.",0,1

Only to log in to online account and find that the items are no longer in stock, no email, no contact for a whole week. I then call and get told that two out of the three items have been oversold and that if I want the other item I can still wait for that which will take another week or more. To this my reply was to cancel the order, I pushed for a gesture of goodwill as failing to know what stock you hold, failing to contact customers within 3-5 working days delivery time. The reply from Aldi was a joke, a £10 voucher to use online to purchase something that may not arrive either and then have to chase your own order. I was a loyal shopper of Aldi and thought online would be the same, I am now a disappointed customer. NEVER will I purchase online from Aldi and if anyone asks I will deter them from you. You couldn't even give me a voucher to use in store where the service is a million miles apart. ALDI ONLINE=A JOKE. FYI ORDER NUMBER 30072040, I made 3 calls and got no where.",0,1

If what you’ve bought doesn’t satisfy any one of the three criteria outlined above, than the retailer that sold it to you is in breach of the Consumer Rights Act.This means that your statutory consumer rights are against the retailer – the company that sold you the product – not the manufacturer.Aldi disagreed this morning when I returned a summer weight duvet (bought 27-06-19) due to the stitching failing and the stuffing moving out of the 'pockets'. According to the manager I get 60 days IF I CHANGE MY MIND. (THAT'S printed on the receipt!) After that I have to take it up with the manufacturer! I didn't change my mind you sold a substandard product. I USED to spend £4000+ a year with them. Guess what? Not now I don't. If I have to buy another at the original price of £10 (I can't they don't have any) then a cheap duvet cost £20 and will (clearly) fail. Then the best option is to go elsewhere and spend £20 and not have to return it......I guess they assume I won't make a fuss, wrong.

Cheap, nasty horrible, hideous tack!! Would not even recommend to a friend that uses tools once every 10 years. They will pack up and fall to pieces soon as its removed from the packaging.

We do raise it every time with the staff before we vacate the store, but all they do is just shrug their shoulders and refund the difference back. It's not just one particular store, as we tend to use three or four stores depending on our location at the time and they are all as bad. The point is we do not spend that much there and yet this week three items were over charged, so it's really quite concerning how much they are making on charging customers more to that of their price labels. We will be raising this issue with Aldi and are keeping our receipts with the errors on for future reference,as we find this practice totally unacceptable.",0,2
Aldi UK,Change is frozen chicken curry and sweet and sour.,Iv been buying the Frozen chicken curry and sweet and sour chicken for year. The cheap one at around 79p. But now they changed the recipe.

Aldi UK,Aldi is Amazing !,"Oh my word. I’ve shopped at Sainsbury’s for 15 years where I was spending about £120 per week for a family of 4. Plus another £25 per week at M&S. I have now, after 3 months of shopping at Aldi, fully converted to Aldi. I now spend £85 per week. The food is amazing. Fruit and veg exactly the same quality of Sainsbury’s. Meat, ready meals, cheese, carvery ham and beef , prawns, chicken sausages, pizza, chocolate, crisps - all outstanding. You simply must give it a go. My family have not complained once. Even their own beef gravy granules taste better than Bisto !",0,5

Love their own brand Diet Coke @ 39p for 2 litres (saving me £21 a week), thick & creamy yoghurts are devine, meat very low price and good quality.Veg not so good, fruit over priced and not high enough in quality to warrant buying. Still get fruit and veg from Sainsbury’s.Oh the bubbly orange chocolate is great, liquorice allsorts are yummy too.Visit with an open mind, and find the product you like and save big!",0,5
Aldi UK,Aldi stripping out product quality,Just noticed that Aldi have changed their garlic infused olive oil to an inferior product ( 5 times less garlic) and Aldi have also changed from a glass bottle that was recyclable to a plastic that is not.

Such a shame as I was a big fan but have noticed a few other of my favourites following the same trend - that’s way I have decidedly to write a review,0,1
Aldi UK,Lowest prices but not the greatest variety,"Lowest prices, variety of products isn't great but OK for your weekly shopping.

Tastless rubbish. All went in the waste bin including the remains of the uncooked chips. The Aldi Hand Cooked sea salt crisps were hard as nails and had no salt taste whatsoever. They went in the waste bin.Finally the Aldi Blackcurrant Cheese Cakes were disappointing. Gooey red sludge Blackcurrant? Concrete biscuit base. .Not impressed.And this shopping trip was spoiled by the aisles being blocked by staff loading shelves and leaving stock all over the aisles. Not a pleasant experience.

Aldi UK,Aldi Rothwell: Terrible Experience,"Have shopped at Aldi longer than probably most of their stores have even been open. These days, due to having a toddler, we do most of our shopping online and just use Aldi to bulk buy certain things.Today I made the mistake of going to their new Rothwell store with my toddler to pick up various items. Wasn't a massive shop as usually I'd spend well over a £100 per visit, but this time it was just to pick up a few things we'd run out of. Among those items were 3 x 6 boxes of fruit pouches for my toddler, leaving another 2 or 3 x 6 boxes on the shelf, along with many, many individual pouches. While walking around the shop for one last item, a woman staff member (could have been a manager, no idea) who was pushing some stock around stops me and tells me that she couldn't ""let me"" buy all of those pouches. She didn't even bother to check what was left on the shelves and stated that there wouldn't be enough left for other customers. So what? I've been to Aldi loads of times when they've sold out of something. There was still plenty left on the shelves and the solution was clearly for Aldi to get a better grip on their own stock management, rather than inconveniencing a customer.My toddler was upset, not understanding why we had to leave the shopping and because I had to go to the nearby Morrisons to pick up the items, it meant that my toddler's nap ended up being pushed out and ruining both of our mornings. I'll never shop at Aldi again, clearly they are so desperate to expand their stores that they'll now hire people who don't have even the most basic understanding of good (or even mediocre) customer service. They are certainly not going to survive against the likes of Amazon if this is how Aldi staff now behave.Will be posting to local community groups to advise them to avoid Aldi too. Most people's time is just too valuable in the hopes of saving a few quid.",0,1

The ‘Aldi Culture’ amongst existing employees is the most political rubbish I’ve ever had the misfortune of experiencing. Managers are two faced, they all have their own little clique and unless your a manager yourself, they honestly do not care about the store assistants. When you hot company targets of completing pallets, they expect you to exceed those targets (even though your are hitting targets set in the company handbook) which is completely unnecessary. The turnover rate for employees at Aldi is mind blowing and that is for a reason. If your looking to work for this company I couldn’t advise you more to stay away and save yourself the hassle.",0,1

I bought this (£9.99) as I believed that this fitted the pole chainsaw. 2 and a bit years down the line, I go to change the chain. It's too big. I felt duped by the way this was stocked. I called customer services and was told to contact the manufacturer. I said that this wasn't a warranty issue. It was a misrepresentation by Aldi. They then said that they couldn't do anything as I didn't have the receipt. It was obviously an Aldi product and I am not a shoplifter. Rubbish service by Aldi. Never buy electrical items that may need other consumable parts. They obviously don't want to supply them so as you throw away a perfectly good item, for the sake of (in this case)a saw chain. Buyer beware. Aldi, you will never get my custom for any other electrical item.....ever! Totally disgusted.",0,1

Aldi UK,Products out if stock and others not stocked ?,I shop in Aldi but it is very frustrating when basic items are not available ! Three weeks couldnt get mixed herbs and also pkt of six apple pies. Also why dont Aldi stock cloudy low cal lemonade or low lemon squash. All the other supermarkets do. Puts me off shopping there. Great prices but sometimes they just rum out of core items and you then have to make another trip elsewhere. Not good!!,0,2
Aldi UK,Cheap but not the best,"Some things are ok, like biscuits and confectionary. Fruit and Veg isn’t clever, it goes of quick and doesn’t taste good. Dairy isn’t as bad but milk sometimes tastes sour. The only soda they do is the cheap stuff. All they do is their own, cheap things. The queues at the checkout are long, and the staff open and close, open and close tills even when there is a big queue. The staff are normally pleasant, but a few are moody. The prices are very low, but you must be willing to have a bad in store experience and tasteless, low quality food. Avoid.",0,2
Aldi UK,Abandoned shopping trolley,"Someone left an ALDI shopping trolley in the alley behind our house on mid May. I contacted our local Council who contacted ALDI who said they would collect it. It is now late August and despite many emails to Customer Service with promises to collect it, the trolley is still there. They no longer even reply to my emails. So it stays there with people leaving beer cans and bottles in it which we keep removing. Apparently a firm called Trolleywise have been asked to fetch it, but no result. As these trolleys cost about £200 apparently I am surprised that they have not bothered to collect it. It seems bad customer services to stop replying to me - I am not impressed!",0,1

Will pick up tomorrow but can't tell me when, ah well at least I'll get my replacement ""OH, NOT TOMORROW, BE SEVEN DAY DELIVERY"" Said the decidedly uninterested ""customer relations person"" so I buy faulty goods, will take 14 days total and why not pick up faulty item when replacement arrives.

Aldi UK,Called into Aldi today for some…water rude member of staff,"Called into Aldi today for some flavored water .I used to be be a regular shopper there right from the very start of the shop ,but i stopped going as regular because the local shop is dirty and dangerous with packed trolley /cages full of food and others full of waste boxes usually with the sharp corners sticking out from the cages i have once caught my leg on a sharp cardboard box corner and cut my leg,Today i wanted some bottled water the price tag showed one price which didn't make sense yet when i queried the price despite the label describing the products correctly i was told it had been marked up wrong, the man took out the label and came back and told me the new price ,it was more than double what the label had said .This was also one of the original reasons i stopped going,incorrect labeling.Things haven't changed i wasn't offered the goods at the marked price.When i got to the checkout i was 20p short in change whtch mean i had to change a £10.00 note for 20p i asked the cashier if he could help the situation by taking the £1.00 coin into account which was in the trolley he said what do you want me to do ,followed but his comment of getting into a dickie for for nothing (i find that remark really bad and offensive for a staff member to say to a customer i feel he said that because i had asked a fellow shopper if i could latch my trolley onto his (which was nearly empty ) to allow me to get my £1.00 coin out therefore having sufficient funds and therefore i wouldn't have had to change a £10.00 note for 20p.I commented to the cashier on his rude remark and lack of customer skills he just said yeah and walked off as the store was now closing.Low and behold when i was in the car park park putting my shopping away the rude staff member got in his car and drove off ,guess what he was parked in a disabled bay,no blue badge on display.",0,1

I have since returned to my normal super market and found bowels are getting back to normal. I will only buy non food items from now on as sadly the food does not agree with me.

Unfortunately, Aldi have changed supplier and now sell 'Bramwells' beans and sausages, which are a higher price, but of very poor quality and taste bad. I will never buy Bramwells again because they are awful and the sauce is the same consistency as water.

The dozy german company wrote back saying ok we will deal with it. Nearly three weeks late and nothing. I shall now dump the crap back into the local store and take my business elsewhere.

When I tipped the meat out I noticed a lump of white gristle which alarmed me because I dislike fatty meat so I rooted through both tins pulling huge lumps of fat out, most of which had very little or no meat attached.This Is CLEARLY a rip off and probably flaunting the rules on honest labelling because it certainly wasn't labelled “stewed gristle”By the time Id sifted through both tins I had an unbelievable 1 tin of meat and 1 full tin of fatty gristle. Having said that I made a pie from the actual meat (which was a whole lot smaller than intended) and I have to be honest It was very very tasty.Its such a shame that they ruined it by throwing the fatty rubbish nobody in their right mind would eat into the tins. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER ALDI, your meat was £2.60 a tin and as half was fat that makes the meat £5.20 a tin in relative terms which is more than twice the price of a tin of fray bentos stewed steak which contains 0 gristle or fat. 100% wont be buying that again.",0,1

Aldi UK,Rancid Chicken,Aldi started off ok when they hit our shores several years ago and at first the population was excited about the competition. This week however has convinced me that standards have slipped. Opened a within date date 'roast in the bag chicken' cost of £3.09 that smelled rancid like rotten fish - had to throw it away. Even eating cooked chicken that is rotten is dangerous to health. Veg is also very hit and miss with some items barely lasting a day before they start to rot and have had to discard several products due to this. If Brexit means poorer food products and selections we are already being weaned back on it - up your game ALDI British public can be very fickle!!!!! I have the receipt.,0,1

Aldi UK,"Yay for plastic reduction, Boo for palm oil!","Shopping at my local store is like visiting friends. The staff are brilliant (mostly) and the fact that there's not a high staff turnover and I can go to the same couple of people on the tills every week, makes me happy. The range and price of products on offer is great and I can buy wonderful things like olive oil, balsamic vinegar, sushi, a selection of olives and more. I eat like royalty but on a budget.I was delighted when I read that ALDI is going to do away with plastic packaging. I'm an ethical shopper so avoiding single use plastics is important to me. The range of free range meat is great but my one single massive bugbear is the use of palm oil in so many of their products.If ALDI is aware of the environmental impact of single use plastics, then they surely must *also* be aware of the devastation caused by palm oil farming. Even 'sustainable' palm oil (which is nothing but 'greenwash')Iceland frozen foods has recognised this and cut the ingredient from all their own brand products, and I have started shopping with them for the first time.If ALDI was interested in the environment, then cutting palm oil from the things they sell, would be a massive and very welcome move.As it is, I take ages shopping as I have to scan the ingredients list on everything I want to buy, and there are loads of things I am unable to buy because they contain palm oil.Other than that I don't know what I'd do without ALDI.

Aldi UK,Ordered a strimmer online,"Ordered a strimmer online, after delivery time expired I phoned and they said they would contact courier and get back to me. 2 days later after hearing nothing I phoned back and finally they told me courier had broken it and as no more in stock they could only refund me.

I looked on the website to find they have one in stick slightly more money. I rang them to ask if they would give me that one for the price of the other one as I have been let down but they said they could not do this. I now have a very disappointed son!

Aldi UK,Are you kidding! Another list customer,"Many years ago, I had a bad experience with Aldi and stopped using them. With the passage of time, I forgot the reason. At a friends house recently, I spotted nice Aldi product and then decided to do my next shop at Aldi.Upon visiting Aldi, reusable bags in hand, I now remember why I stopped using them. Half an hour round trip to visit, completely wasted, due to no coin for trolley and therefore physically unable to shop. Are they kidding! Still! In this day and age. It was onward and back to Tesco. Cashless society, you halfwits. Unless I forget again, I won’t touch these marketing inept halfwits again. A straw poll of a number of my friends had the same experience and similarly, simply walked in, then out. Doh!",0,1

Aldi UK,Ashby de la Zouch Store,"This review is based on my experience in the Ashby store with checkout operator Hayley and the Store Manager.I was shopping with my elderly mother who requested Hayley wait until I had placed the shopping she had already scanned into the trolley. She ignored this request and continued, so my mother asked again. There was a brief pause before Hayley said ""you're not supposed to pack your shopping here, you're meant to do it over there"" and pointed to the shelving at the end. I have fibromyalgia and was in a lot of pain and my mother suffers with arthritis. We weren't ""packing"" but our shopping contained delicate items like eggs so I wasn't about to ""chuck it"" into the trolley as Hayley seemed to want us to. I didn't feel I should have to explain why it was maybe taking me longer to remove the shopping she had scanned, she should have acknowledge the request for her to slow down.As Hayley shoved more items through and almost tipped others off the side I looked up to see her giving me the dirtiest of looks. I said ""I don't appreciate the way you've spoken to me"" to which she replied ""I haven't spoken to you"". The attitude that came with the pedantic comment was that of a petulant teenager! I said ""okay then, I don't appreciate the way you've spoken to my mother"". The response was a shrug. I carried on placing a couple of items of shopping in the trolley. Again, Hayley shoved more shopping on the side and almost off the end. I'd had enough of her attitude and decided I would pack the shopping there and then and said ""you're going to have to slow down now because I'm going to pack the shopping here"". Her reply ""no I'm not"".I hope that Hayley never gets fibromyalgia and has to deal with someone like herself! I had to grab an item before it fell off which caused a serious pain in my shoulder so I said she was rude, arrogant, condescending and an ignorant b*tch. She told me I was ""common"" and that we should shop elsewhere.At this point I have to say I have never had these problems in the Coalville store who seem to have better disability awareness and better attitudes.I told Hayley I would happily shop elsewhere and that if every checkout operator in that store had her attitude towards the people who pay her wages she wouldn't have a job soon.Once outside, my mother was really upset and I was quite angry. I shouldn't have to explain that I have a medical condition to a shop assistant to justify being treated in a respectful manner. I called the Customer Service number and was on the phone to them when the store manager and Hayley came out to the car park. Despite being on the phone, the store manager came marching up to me and said ""I understand you've got a problem"". She had no idea who I was on the phone to and clearly didn't care.I said I was dealing with the issue with the customer service team. Rather than leaving me alone she carried on aggressively harassing me so eventually, after another customer who clearly didn't know the facts decided to get involved too, I'd had enough and told them to f*** off. I'm now banned from the store.I understand that Aldi staff are targeted on the number of items they scan but if a customer isn't physically able to move items off the counter quickly they shouldn't be subject to the dire attitude Hayley displayed, particularly when she had been asked to slow down twice. My disability might not be obvious and maybe Hayley would like me to wear a badge that says I'm in a lot of pain and can't move quickly before she will treat me (and my shopping) with some common decency?That particular Aldi store doesn't appear to have trained their staff very well on either customer service or disability awareness and the company as a whole doesn't appear to have trained their staff on Data Protection. When I requested a copy of the CCTV from the store (I hadn't been aware that there was CCTV recording which is also a problem) and the call recordings I was told I couldn't have the CCTV footage as it wasn't personal data. The fact that I was told the store manager was reviewing the CCTV footage means that they were using it to identify me and it was therefore personal data. When I explained that this was a breach of GDPR and informed the operator that I would start recording the call he said he didn't agree to me doing so and would hang up. I said I wanted to record it so that I had evidence that they were breaking the law to submit a complaint to the ICO and he hung up the call. I called back and was again told that CCTV footage wasn't personal data, then I was told that I had to put my request in writing to an e-mail address. GDPR enables a SAR to be made verbally to any point of a business. Eventually I was passed to someone who did seem to know what my rights were and has agreed to supply the data requested. I hope this review results in some proper training for staff.",0,2

Their stock is extremely cheap, much more so than Tesco or local shops. I literally paid half my usual weekly cost the week I discovered Aldi. Regardless — I still don't buy all my goods from Aldi. Some of their items are just not as good as name brands or tescos, but considering the price that's more than understandable. My main gripe is how you can buy a good two weeks and it will taste differently between each week (for example their pickles and chocolate chip cookies have a rather inconsistent taste). Still, — well worth the price savings. Definitely recommend.",0,4

Aldi UK,"Good products, bad experiences....","They sell really good stuff, from the produce to the special buys....Online ordering is terrible though, delivery is so slow.... I've made two orders from them, one took two weeks and the other took three weeks.... I've had stuff arrive from China quicker than from Aldi's warehouse....My other problem is getting round your Stevenage store.... It's like an adventure course.... There's always pallets, cages and piles of boxes everywhere. So hard to get round with a trolley or pram, especially with everyone else's trolleys.... I've lost count of the amount of times I've just abandoned my shopping trip because I've gotten stuck somewhere and stressed out....",0,3
Aldi UK,Claustrophobic,"Don’t like Aldi stores layout they aren’t laid out nicely and when you go in and decide to not buy anything, there is no easy way to go out. Doesn’t stock much branded stuff compared to the the top 4 stores. To be honest, it’s not worth going to aldi for the money you save, never really have a pleasant shopping experience",0,2

The item was safely resting in the warehouse from 18th May and was delivered this morning 28th May only to find it's the wrong colour. We never ordered beige! I have requested a full refund and for the item to be collected immediately. Absolutely disgusting service and will think twice about ordering again!",0,1
Aldi UK,DO NOT BUY ONLINE; THERE IS NO WARRANTY,I am a loyal customer of Aldi for years and I have bought from groceries to skiing gear. At the end of February this year I spotted on the Special Buys a Sandwich press so I ordered on line a Ambiano Compact Sandwich Press as I didn't have much time at that time to visit the shop. The product arrived as has been promised; I collected from my local Tesco shop. I have used a coupled of times and heard a crackling noise (like the kettle does) and I thought it was normal. Last week I realised that it has arrived with a crack on the plastic structure and the noise is because it was breaking when I pressed my panini Sandwich. Obviously I have called customer service today for an exchange and the answer was there is not proof when this happen and it was my duty to check the product when it arrived. My eyesight is not good so I didn't see the crack on the black structure until it was split. Lesson learnt; do not buy anything online from Aldi neither trust a warranty from Aldi.,0,1
Aldi UK,NEVER USE THEIR ONLINE SERVICE !,"I ordered an iron £19.99 from them online as they had sold out instore.

Aldi UK,NO FREE FROM FOODS!,"Apart from cheaper prices, Aldi’s range is very poor. I have to eat gluten free foods and was so shocked to find that they sell no products specifically for coeliac sufferers. I went with my boyfriend (who can eat anything) and we had to do two shopping trips and because of this, did most of our shopping at the Co-op. Aldi do not even sell gluten free bread - I think it is crazy to exclude people who suffer from such a common disease nowadays!",0,2

Aldi UK,Online Customer Service is non existent,"I have shopped at Aldi for years and have always found my experience to be a positive one. I feel their products are great value for money and will continue to shop in store.My online experience was dramatically different. Even though I have a sign on, I couldn't find my order on the site after I purchased it. I was given no indication as to when it would arrive, it just showed up one day. It did seem to take longer than I expected, but not too long.Upon receipt of the item (a carryon suitcase), I felt the quality wasn't very good. Not to worry, the receipt stated I could return it to my local Aldi, using Collet+ or Royal Mail.Took it back to my local store to be told they do not accept ""Special Buys"" at the shop. I then packaged it up in the original box and took it to my nearest Collect+ to be told it was too big. I contacted Aldi on Twitter and after 2 weeks of back and forth, someone called me. She advised that I couldn't return it via Royal Mail either. A collection by Hermes would need to be arranged. She said it clearly states this on the website. I have looked and cannot find this anywhere. It certainly doesn't state it on my receipt or I would have done this.Now, the collection has been scheduled in 10 days time and I will be required to sit in and wait from 8am to 6pm. So, wasting about 12 hours in total to return a cheap plastic suitcase. Needless to say, my Aldi online shopping experience will end when that bag is collected. We live and learn.",0,1

Aldi UK,Never use Aldi online - Totally useless.,Appalling service. Ordered a £150 dual fuel BBQ online and never received it. Numerous emails to the Aldi courier went unanswered. Courier phone number was disconnected. Aldi ‘Lack of Customer Services’ could not provide any information and did not respond to online messages and emails for days on end. After repeatedly ringing and being kept on hold for 30 minutes for a customer service adviser I was told the item must have been lost and was now out of stock. Only offered a refund after a month of waiting for the BBQ!!!!! What about compensation for the breach of contract and grief it has caused me to chase this up?? I asked for £50 compensation which is the difference in price for an identical BBQ at Asda (in stock). Aldi’s offer was a £10 voucher for my next online purchase!!! There won’t be a next online purchase. I’ll be seeing Aldi in Small Claims Court to answer to my claim for compensation for breach of contract. BUY FROM ALDI AT YOUR PERIL.,0,1

Aldi UK,"Rubbish customer service in Ashby, Scunthorpe","Usually go to a certain one in Scunthorpe in town, however was near the Ashby one so popped in there. Had a rolling basket to put shopping in, I got my shopping and two 10 packs of Coke cans. Couldn’t carry it all so had my shopping in the bag and the cokes in the basket. As I was going out the door, a lady on the checkout shouted at me saying ‘you can’t take the baskets outside!’ I did respond asking if someone could help me carry the stuff out if I’m not allowed to take it out. There was no need to shout at me, maybe instead offer assistance to help me out, she could see my hands were full. Also another member of staff was just laughing at the situation. After I asked for help, a lovely gentleman came out with me and said he’ll grab the basket when I had took them to my car, so at least one person was nice and knows how to talk to customers.Overall I don’t see the massive issue of taking a basket outside, and I would rather not be shouted at like I am a criminal stealing something, instead maybe offer to help. Won’t be going back to that one.",0,2
Aldi UK,Abysmal Delivery Service!,"We tried the Aldi delivery service for the first time on 3rd May. We ordered online & were advised that the items would be delivered within 3-5 working days - but when it didn’t turn up by day 6 we called their customer service and were kept waiting for 25 minutes! The advisor informed us that we should receive them in a couple of days, but that wasn’t correct either, they eventually turned up on the 11th day! What’s really frustrating is that at no time were we advised as to why there was any delay, if other large Company’s can deliver promptly - why can’t Aldi? Suffice to say we have been extremely disappointed with ordering through Aldi - and shall never do so again! Aldi need to get themselves organised.",0,1

Aldi UK,15 months past best before date,"I purchased a bottle of sterlised milk from Aldi on the 03/05/2019. When i got home feeling thirsty i opened the milk and took a mouthful only to spit out what i can only describe as cottage cheese. After heaving from the awful texture and taste,not to mention the smell. I looked at the date on the bottle. To my horror it was 15 months past the best before date. (28/02/2018). I have complained to head office whose response was ""WOW"" and was told to take it back and get a refund and as a goodwill gesture they will give me a £5 gift voucher. Which i refused it was then increased to £10. I have refused that also. They are now looking into the complaint or as they say""investigating"" looks like they will be blaming a dating problem at the factory. Hmmmm but wouldn't that mean more of the same bottles on the shelves and no product recall? So i have informed the Environmental Health who were horrified and have since made a visit the day after my complaint. Someone is to blame and not a machine printing dates.I don't think Aldi realise how serious this could have been if it was ingested.Will never buy fresh food from here again.",0,1

The same thing happened to me on a previous order only then they tried to locate stock for me to collect from a local store this time their customer service staff just seemed to accept it as routine and promise a refund and said they have already sent me an insulting goodwill gesture of a £5 vouchercode of my next order, which I haven't even received! I didn't want good will I wanted my stuff delivered as part of a basic service! Perhaps Aldi should stick to selling past its best produce in old fashioned tiny supermarkets with long queues and brusque checkout staff which in my experience they do really well and leave the online sales to the other retailers already offering a far superior service.

So I Called Aldi again and finally they put me through to someone, they couldn’t see or advise a dispatch date, so I’m now thinking they may have sold out on line and have no stock left and at that point wishing I had bought these items from my local store! The only reason why I bought online is because of lifting and carrying bulky boxes on my own! I asked the assistant if there was any stock left at my local store and there was so i said can I purchase in store and cancel my on line order as you can’t give me any indication when my order will be delivered!?

I tend to go Fridays so expect the stock to be full, not so you go in and this store has been taken over by pallets stccked with goods and articles to be put on shelves also baskets with empty cardboard boxes. These pallets are a hazard to shoppers completely taking over the shop floor, surely these could be done at some other time namely when shoppers are not in store. Do they not have evening staff to do these sort of jobs or even early morning. May I say I am not the only one to see this problem. We cannot get round the shop without coming up against PALLETS or rubbish BASKETS. Please change this store to make our life easier.",0,3
Aldi UK,In praise of Aldi,"I have been an Aldi customer for many years, previously a Sainsbury's and Asda customer. My weekly bill dropped by a third. Aldi brands were not familiar to me so I began by trying 4 or 5 new items each week and before long I was doing a full basket. We love the great selection of sliced bread and bake at home rolls and baguettes made by The Village Bakery. I buy all my beautiful flowers there and sometimes they last up to 3 weeks, if I remember to change the water daily. I buy all our spirits, beer and wine there, our coffee and cereals.Over the years I have bought a steamer, floor mop, slow cooker, George Forman grill, kettle, coffee maker, iron etc and everything is still in regular use today.I'm not so keen on their fruit and vegetables as, being packed in bulk in plastic bags and plastic trays, they show signs of withering after just a day. I shop at our local farmers market but, to be fair, the prices are twice that of Aldi, though there is no wastage at all. I enjoy browsing the middle isles in their stores and often find something unusual for the garden We have 3 Aldi stores within easy access and I shop at all of them. Tills are speedy, assistants helpful and stores are easy to get around. I enjoy shopping at Aldi but there are things I prefer to buy elsewhere e.g meat from the local butcher. cheese from the farmer's market.",0,5

Aldi UK,I wish I could say better but....,"I wish I could say better but I have been nothing but disappointed in the comistomer service recieved when purchasing large garden furniture via their website. My initial email regarding delivery contained a broken link for tracking and an emailed request for a correct pink went unanswered.I was given no update on shipping until I contacted the delivery company, who advised a date and time for deliver for the next day. I took time off work and sat at home yet no delivery arrived. A further phone call revealed that Aldi has requested the wrong type of delivery (one man) and that the item would need to be sent back to their depot in order to be sent back out with the correct team (two man). I was then informed that the new delivery team would have to be in contact once they recieved the item to arrange delivery, for which I would have to be home to accept, yet only deliver on certain days. The only day available turns out to be a date me and my partner were working and they couldn't offer another date within a fortnight.As a result, we called and cancelled the order. This is when customer service really failed. During my initial phone call to request a cancellation, I requested an email from the service advisor that I spoke to, I was assured that this would be sent as soon as our call ended. It never arrived. I called the next day to enquire why I hadn't recieved it, but no answer given, and to be informed that the return request would have to be requested once again. During the entire return process, I recieved not one single update from Aldi, unless I called which resulted in a nice large phone bill this month.

I took days off work after XDP messaged me that they were delivering to me, twice, and no show. Apparently ALDI had sent it on a one man delivery when it needed two. Over the next weeks of phone calls receiving promises and apologies I’m left feeling this whole experience has been a debacle and ALDI should sort their act out.

Aldi UK,"XDP advised they would deliver Monday, 29th April, but they have now lost the parcel","How bad can it get ?Aldi Order no 24501153 XDP Consignment Number:ZWAEXN133280We ordered garden furniture 1st April. To comply with the 3 to10 working day delivery. It should have arrived by last Wednesday 17th April. Wednesday 10th April we received a 21 minute notice from XDP that a delivery was to be made. By that time we had been out of the house for 2 hours. But. The delivery must have been for the cover we ordered and not for the furniture, because the delivery had come from Nottingham in a tiny van. XDP only have one man delivery services from that depot. XDP say Aldi have put all the garden furniture down to Economy Delivery (1 man) but it takes 2 men to deliver the furniture. XDP say that all the furniture has been loaded onto a lorry and sent to Birmingham. We live in Nottingham, so our furniture was going further away.Karen at XDP promised the furniture would arrive, yesterday, without fail, between 2.35pm and 4.35pm. XDP were employing more staff to cover Good Friday, because of Aldis error. So we stopped in all day. We have stopped in for 8 days now. Needles to say the furniture didn't arrive. We dont know where it is, or if we will ever receive it.Niether XDP or Aldi telephoned us to let us know.Despite telephoning and emailing both Aldi and XDP almost every day we still have not received the furniture. Aldi dont care, they have our £199.99 plus the price of the cover (we have no use for a furniture cover, we do not have the furniture.) XDP dont care, they just lie.The moto of this story is.

When I questioned her why she did this, she said we are trained to do this. After speaking to the store manager who was labelled as an apprentice, he said we always do this. Neither were apologetic and their attitude towards me was patronising and hostile. I didn't want my shopping and they couldnt give a crap. They said well that's up to you.

Aldi UK,Internet sales and large item delivery,"To Mr Giles Hurley, UK CEO Aldi Re – Web sales and home delivery from Aldi – Garden furniture - Order 24456521XPD Consignment number - ZWAEXN131774We wish to bring to your attention the difficulties we have had with an order placed on 31st March 2019. The service we have received, in sharp contrast to that in your supermarkets, has been unacceptable. We are uncertain as to where the problem lies i.e., with Aldi, its courier XPD Limited or perhaps both. Briefly, we were advised on Tuesday 9th April that the furniture would arrive later that day between 4:20 pm and 6:20 pm. This was confirmed in an SMS message from XPD. This, however, was not the promised three-day notice so our arrangements to be in London had to be cancelled to facilitate this delivery. As it turned out there was no delivery so we complained to Aldi Customer Relations the following day and were assured that the item would be delivered last Thursday between 2 pm and 4 pm. In addition, we were advised we would be contacted in case of any change. There was no confirmation SMS message this time. We again waited in last Thursday afternoon and as there was still no delivery we complained to Aldi Customer relations by telephone and email and cancelled the order. We were advised that should the item be delivered later that day to refuse it.On Friday evening at 7:30 pm, without any prior warning, an attempt was made to deliver the furniture and, as requested by Aldi, we refused to accept the item. We have yet to be fully reimbursed for the delivery charge",0,1

Aldi UK,"Food & clothes getting worse & not much cheaper, if at all.","Fruit, vegetables & clothes bad.I buy a lot of wrapped fruit and vegetables every week and try to buy British.The British apples were ok with the odd one scarred. That's fine, but getting to the point where they are so bad, they have to be peeled, just to be edible.Last purchased packs have been getting worse, heavily scarred apples and today, rotten with something like a millipede/earwig living in it, that fell out into my room, before I could dispose of the fruit.Also packed potatoes can open and be rotten where I have to discard half the pack. Even if this is down to 'a bad crop' it shouldn't be passed onto the customer. It should be filtered out at source when being packed. It's not just wonky fruit, it's disgusting and a waste of time & money. Seems like Aldi or their suppliers are just offloading trash onto the public, for more profit.If I leave the fruit a couple of days, whether grapes or any, it's bad enough to be unedible (or rotten straight away). I don't have any earwigs/millipedes in any other food, so they didn't come from here. Even stored in the fridge, the fruit & vegetables from Aldi, just go straight off, if they're not already bad when I buy them.Bought some tracksuit bottoms, for using to rest in, around the house. After about 5 months, the crotch split along the stitching, with occasional, normal wear, (not in a gym or training), just sitting around.(They were the correct size).Even if these items were cheaper, than other retailers, they wouldn't be worth buying when I can go to ASDA and for the same price, (or maybe 25p more for a pack of apples), get food that lasts or isn't rotten when I get it home.I use Aldi cause it's convenient to where I live, but it's getting too unreliable and the quality isn't worth saving a few pounds, when you've got to dispose of it.",0,2

Since I needed the wine for a party I wanted to cancel the order. The Aldi lady I spoke to was very helpful and promised me that they would send the wine and would guarantee delivery the next day - Saturday. I received a dispatch note with the assurance the delivery would be with me on Saturday. At 6.00 pm I had heard nothing so had to drive 20 miles to the nearest off licence to buy 12 bottles of wine as the party was the next day - a Sunday. Monday I again phoned Aldi who said Yodel had not received the wine but blamed Yodel as apparently they are very behind. Why wasn't I told this when I first phoned and wanted to cancel. The lady said she would refund the money which would take 3 working days. When I said they had had my money for over a week and I had had to spend that much again + cost me time and petrol money she said that was why she was refunding me the money without first contacting Yodel.

Aldi UK,Aldi Queenborough Warehouse review,"Aldi Queenborough Warehouse review:-Don't work here especially if you are not local. (Must read!!)Pros: (Clean) workplace apart from the canteen and toilets with the way staff treat them but it does have cleaners there.(Safe) working environment due to cameras everywhere inside and out.(Treats) - Aldi treat you at Christmas to pizza, shopping vouchers and throughout the year at other times to cakes.(Showers) - Showers are provided here which is never a bad thing in a workplace.(Overtime) - available sometimes but not paid usually if at all which can also be a con obviously too.Cons: Lack of hours - You are told that you will more than likely get more than 30 hours which you are contracted to but it is a lie. - You barely hit 30 most weeks (especially when management are trying to rush you out of the door so that Aldi can basically pay you a minimum wage payslip at the end of the month (based on 45 hours in other places a week) and so that they can save Aldi money and earn their bonuses. Aldi are very clever with reeling you in with a good hourly rate but not telling you all of this before you change job to join them.Lack of organisationLack of uniform - Aldi barely give you anything and when it does come in they don't give it to who has requested it, they chuck it all on the floor so it is a free for all and everyone picks it up so you lose out or often don't get what you need and when you manage to get a hold of any the uniform is junk. The gloves don't keep your hands warm in the chilled area which you are in mainly, they get holes in them in no time, have no grip or your fingers don't go through the finger holes fully because of the design and because they are junk.Bad management - Management are only interested in themselves and getting their bonuses. They don't care about your health, ideas, concerns, or anything else you have to say unless it saves Aldi money or benefits them. They want you to pick 240 cases an hour which is achievable in most areas but no all like they say and even if you have an injury the c*cky management down there especially Ian on Pick to Zero says you can either do the job or not and they still expect you when injured which they cause in the first place by putting you under pressure to hit your targets which are raised if you are achieving them. -You can never do enough for them and they are always right.Bad pay - Your pay is up and down like a yo-yo from one month to the next. You have to average it out every 2 months or by the length of time you've been there to work out what you are being paid each month on average. - No good to anyone with a mortgage who needs a guaranteed amount every month. Aldi want to pay you as little as possible every month and managers get bonuses to reduce Aldis outgoings by rushing you out of the door and/or pick stock with you (rarely.) - To get into management you have to be lazy or no good at your job. They hook and reel people in by what they pay you an hour but what they don't tell you is that you will be rushed to get back out of the door and barely hit your 30 hours a week on contract of which they take back from you in terms of money from one month to the next if you haven't done 30 hours one week which is quite often. You also get looked at rudely and questioned like a criminal if you help out others picking during shift or at the end of shift and logistic assistants by stacking and dropping off pallets because they want you out of the door asap and don't want you trying to bump up your money. You are often told lies by management. Management tell you what you want to hear but do and think the opposite. Aldi don't pay you correctly. They try to get out of paying you overtime money and normal hours whereby possible. I am still owed overtime from the new year (3 months ago) hence why I didn't do it anymore along with the fact that you shouldn't have to do overtime to bring up your bad pay at the end of the month.Payslips - These are junk. The payslips in ways make it difficult to work out your wages (which Aldi probably want so they can not pay you if they think they can get away with it.)Staff - other normal staff have no manners some of them, leave waste on the tables in the canteen and spillages laying around. They also chuck rubbish and toilet rolls around everywhere in the toilets all over the floor. They spit unnecessarily, and leave their pee or faeces all over the toilet because they have no respect for others and are brought up badly like most people on the inbred island. Most staff are chavs and other undesirables that think they are something special. You also get staff here sticking up for Aldi and the management weirdly which I will never understand as you have to look out for yourself because other people don't look out for you especially management here. Some staff are rude and abusive here not being filtered out.Access card - you practically have to beg to get one of these as the management are useless, it's not for them so they are not bothered and when you have a bladder problem especially it is not on to have to wait months for these. Often these stop working too and then you have to wait months again.Security - these hassle you if you don't stick to the pathetic 5mph speed limit which is far too slow on such a huge site as it takes you forever to get to one side of the site to the other. These throw their weight around, some are abusive, not understanding just like management and are still there and employed somehow in the first place. You get 3 warnings for speeding over 5mph and then you have to park off-site and risk your car not getting vandalised, hit, or getting a ticket/towed away for where you park. When you are running late they don't care.Toilets - these flush every 5 seconds even when you haven't entered the cubicle like the management say with a hi-vis on as they say you should to stop the constant flushing and it's annoying when you are just trying to relax and go to the toilet on them. Foreigners - I am not racist but you can tell they don't like the English. Most are ok to you unlike at Lidl but all of them behind closed doors don't like you so it's best to avoid them where possible. Treat people as they treat you. They usually stick together away from you.Head Office and Payroll - Head office doesn't answer their phones and just keeps on ringing if you need to ask something and the payroll department only speak with management apparently. Management say if you want to speak to payroll you have to go through us which is ridiculous. You probably will have to wait forever to get answers through management, keep asking, they're not interested as it isn't their money and they probably conspire against you together with Payroll.In short most things bad to mention here are: Lack of hours & organisation, bad pay, bad management most of them, lies told here often, incorrect pay, no overtime paid, no way to contact head office or payroll directly (I wonder why), lack of uniform, rude, ignorant, unclean, lazy, racist and bad mannered staff here.",0,2
Aldi UK,Rubbish Delivery service.,If I could give 0 I would.I placed an order on line on 17/03/19 on 24/03/19 I received an email stating the parcel had been despatched.It’s now 30/03/19 and I’m still waiting on a parcel.It’s too late now for Mother’s Day.I email head office and I got a replay saying“Where looking into the complaint”The most annoying part of this is onThur 28th and Fri 29th Aldi were advertising delivery in 24 hours in time for Mother’s Day.3 weeks ago I made my order.,0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi - always a pleasure,"Often use their online ordering and have never had an issue.When I had an issue with their delivery company, THEY were the ones who contacted me- to see how they could help, and even offered me a voucher to apologise for the fact that I was advised I could use a different delivery company- which was not entirely correct.I often shop in store too and the checkout staff are always amazingly helpful and cheerful. They open a new till whenever they find queues building at the checkout and the products are great value for money- especially some of the personal care products.",0,4

Aldi UK,Don't purchase anything online - they literally can't deliver.,"One of the worst online purchase experiences I've ever had. Awful communications - no feedback from them after phoning their call centre several times. The parcel had been lying in a Hermes depot ( Trustpilot rating 92% = bad) for five days with no indication when it could be delivered and it had become abundantly clear they CANNOT DELIVER the package. I therefore did them a favour and CANCELLED THE ORDER. In future, I will not be dealing with this hopelessly inefficient, unresponsive and ultimately failing company. It will take 14 days for this incompetent company to return my money, in addition I have spent hours on the phone and took one day off waiting for the delivery. Their UK CEO is on record as saying "" Marks and Spencer standards at Tesco prices"". A joke that could win a Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival.",0,1
Aldi UK,Ordered some wine with Aldi,"Ordered some wine with Aldi, Yodel promised to deliver Monday 25 March. I waited in noting. Yodel sent email saying it had been delivered and signed for when it hadn't. Phone Aldi they said they'd look into it and it would take 24-48 hours. Nothing. Phoned Aldi this morning and ""Yodel is investigating"". I said a refund would be quicker as I had spent a lot of time on it. Aldi refused and said they had to ""go through their processes"". Yodel's stupidity is not Aldi's fault but Aldi is rubbish for not fixing the matter. Won't be buying anything from Aldi again.",0,2

Talk about the extra mile they do it with a smile , the experenice is valuable ,no wonder more people are shopping at this store ALL THE STAFF are really helpfull Great fresh produce , fish ,and most off all a very Clean store may be they could use this store as a example thank you.",0,5

Aldi UK,Don't use Aldi online,"Don't use Aldi online. My honest rating would be zero stars. I pre-ordered and paid for two water butts plus delivery. When they didn't arrive I was told they had been damaged in transit, all of the online water butts had now sold out so if I still wanted some I would have to go and get them myself from a local store. Apparently it was ""logistically impossible"" for them to pick two up and deliver them to me. I was then told I would have to wait until the water butts had been returned to Aldi by the delivery company who damaged them before they would give me a refund. I said I wasn't prepared to wait to have money back for two items I had never seen. Aldi backed down, told me I could have the refund right away - then deposited the £3.95 delivery fee into my account but failed to refund me the £58.98 I paid for the water butts. It took another two days for them to finally return the money, but not until I had spent ages on the phone and finally threatened them with the press. A really terrible service. Avoid at all costs.",0,1

Aldi UK,A pleasant shopping experience at Aldi.,A pleasant shopping experience at Aldi.In my town the supermarket choice is robust.Where Aldi differs is the friendliness of staff and a distinct lack of employees replenishing shelves and getting in the way of customers.It is only a shame the car park is usually rammed full (possibly with non Aldi shoppers.)

Aldi UK,The Aldi in Eastleigh is fantastic,"The Aldi in Eastleigh is fantastic. Modern, lovely staff who are bright and motivated and seem to really enjoy their job and interacting with customers. Prices are great and the fresh fruit and veg are always great quality. They reduce things by half price if they are getting very close to the sell by date so amazing bargains to be gained on stir fry veg, salad and bread at times. Parking is FREE and I go during the day and can get close to the store. They open checkouts very quickly when queues gather. I use the long tables behind the checkouts to organise my groceries as there isn't much room to do it at checkout but that's not an issue for me. I now use Aldi as my main shop. Love the dark mint chocolate, thick yoghurts, low price wine, cod cakes, beetroot salad/leaves, mini magnums, Welsh goat's cheese, daughter loves the vegetable sushi. OK, I'll stop now!",0,5

Aldi UK,I visited my Aldi store in Tamworth…,"I visited my Aldi store in Tamworth again yesterday and received shocking service as I had to ask the cashier to wait 2 minutes whilst I transferred cash into my current account as when I went to pay, my payment would not authorise. I explained my issue and explained it would all take less than two minutes which it did. The cashier cancelled my transaction and to my embarrassment carried on serving customers around me! One of those customers insulted me saying that ‘ I should sort out my finances’ I was disgusted to be honest. When I complained to the Head Office there was no apology as Aldi day that they operate differently to other supermarkets! They sure do! They treat customers with pure contempt. I will not go in to an Aldi again. While I’m here I would also like to add that all this copy cat marketing does not go down well with the real quality food manufacturers; neither is it ethical really?! The copy cat food tastes nothing like and you may get it cheaper but you get half the quality in my experience. The soft fruit tastes awful too. There are certain items I used to go in for; however you can still buy these items in another supermarket and within their basics range and they taste the same pretty much; so Aldi really are no better! I have to say the clientele in Sainsbury’s is totally different also and I think owing to my experience yesterday that will my reason mainly for avoiding Aldi in the future!",0,1

Aldi UK,"Dishonest, avoid","I was supposed to receive a jack and beanstalk costume from Aldi via Yodel for an event of 'world book day' at my son's school. The item arrived one day late after the event. We, especially my son, was really shocked. Yodel and ALDI blamed each other for the delay. What I realize, these blood sucking companies don't bother about small items or money or the emotion that might be involved with even a little item. I initially thought I would make a case in consumer court. But these dishonest people might have many lawyers working from them. I am also a full-time researcher working at Imperial college, so I will not be able to manage time to fight them. So I have chosen to curse them and put negative reviews and aware others.",0,1
Aldi UK,ADLI ON-LINE EXPERIENCE - VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"I'm really disappointed with the ALDI on-line shopping experience. The last three orders I have placed have had problems of one kind or another. My last order was for some bedroom items. The order included an electric blanket, but the one they sent out was totally different from the one they had advertised. This happens a lot on the ALDI website, items are advertised with the wrong information and pictures. When I checked later, I noticed that ALDI had altered the page. The information had changed, but it still had errors, and the pictures showing a different electric blanket, the one I thought I was getting, had been removed. There was now only one picture showing a different electric blanket - a blanket which I didn't want and which I never ordered - but it was the one ALDI had sent out to me. I submitted a review about the blanket and the problems I had experienced with the order, but ALDI rejected the review. They wouldn't say why they had rejected the review, just that it didn't meet their rules. Without feedback from ALDI as to why they rejected my review, how are you supposed to alter it? What happens if you disagree with their reasons for rejecting the review. It was an honest review, maybe they just didn't like the criticism. I won't be ordering from ALDI again.",0,1

Aldi UK,"DO NOT BY FROM THEM ONLINE, DO NOT TRUST THEM","LATEST UPDATEI eventually got my delivery today !!! (Only 7 days late).The driver rang up and was STROPPY on the phone and was complaining to me that I had complained to Yodel. The driver then wanted to know where I wanted it delivered and I said I wanted it delivered to the address on the box but this seemed to really upset the driver. According to the driver it was fine to have delivered the parcel to another property 100 yards away IN A DIFFERENT POSTCODE. The driver was also adamant that although it was delivered to a different address from the address written on the box it was apparently delivered correctly and I was in the wrong !!!! This company is a complete shambles and if that driver is a typical example of their employees then it is not surprising that their reviews show that they are rubbish. Couldn't organise a party in a brewery.SEE AT THE BOTTOM FOR UP DATES !!!I ordered from Aldi as they did not have the item in store. I got an Email 02/03/19 saying I would have my delivery that day. It didn't turn up. The driver wouldn't answer on the number given as his / hers. I then had another Email 04/03/19 saying my item has been delivered but it hasn't. Again, no answer from delivery driver's phone. I rang and complained and they say that it has been delivered and that I have signed for it !!!!! Bunch of liars. Must be the delivery driver stealing it and faking the signatures. I would rate them zero but I do not have that option. I even pointed out to Aldi that we have multiple CCTV cameras here and I invited them to come and review our CCTV footage but they refused. I said that our cameras would show me clearly visible for a minimum of 45 minutes either side of their claimed delivery time and clearly no delivery nor me (or anybody else) signing for anything but according to Aldi I have had it and signed for it !!!! Bunch of liars. NEVER EVER buy online from them, they will steal your money and not deliver then claim that you have signed despite clear CCTV evidence to the contrary. ONLY EVER BUY IN STORE, IF NOT AVAILABLE DO NOT BUY ON LINE.Email in reply to delivery claim Email:I received an Email early morning Saturday 02/03/19 saying that my item would be delivered that day but it was not delivered. The next Email arrived on the afternoon of Monday 04/03/19 saying that my item had been delivered but it had not.I rang Aldi and complained anc they said that it had been delivered and that i had signed for it which is a total lie.Our premises is covered by cctv and I offered to let Aldi come and view the cctv but they declined. I have been through the cctv from 45 minutes before your claimed delivery to 45 minutes after your claimed delivery (by which time I had received the Email claiming delivery) and you can see me clearly visible fir the whole time on the cameras and you can also see that there is no delivery whatsoever and I do not sign fir anything at any time and nor does anyone else on the premises so the claimed delivery is a complete lie.YOU HAVE NOT DELIVERED, NEITHER I NOR ANY OTHER WORKER HERE HAVE SIGNED FOR IT AND YOUR DRIVER DID NOT ATTEND THE PREMISES AT ANY TIME AND THERE IS FULL CCTV EVIDENCE YO BACK THIS UP. ANY CLAIM TO HAVE DELIVERED IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER LIE.Email back from delivery:Thank you for contacting Yodel.Please allow me to apologise that you had reason to contact us regarding your recent experience.Having looked into the concerns you have raised in conjunction with the parcel tracking history, I do see that the matter has been previously escalated. The feedback received is that the driver has delivered the parcel to the big white house at the front of the site. Should you require any further assistance please do not hesitate to get in touch. Email back to delivery: (no further reply from them) 1. The driver should deliver to the address given not to some other address that he / she feels like delivering it to.2. The house at the front of the site is divided into two flats and neither flat occupant has the parcel. Also, if the driver had entered the park then the cameras would have picked him / her up but there was no non company vehicle vehicle entered the park during the period previously described of 45 minutes either side of the claimed delivery time. The driver and you are lying and I am informing the police.",0,1

When your shopping you have people cleaning to floor and telling you to move. You can't get to some of the aisles as they are blocked with the cages of stuff to go out onto the shop floor. I've had a assistant tell a collegue who was behind me in the queue to come forward and she served her first while I had to wait. Not even asked me if ok until she was scanning the goods.

Aldi UK,good,"Great products and very cheap,, Overall good but staff always chat between themselves. V.rude.",0,4
Aldi UK,Inferior quality and poor shopping experience,"Yes, the prices are good but I think Aldi is getting very smug and complacent about their success in the UK. As a result customer service is suffering. I have stopped going to their Ripon store because : -(1) you can never be sure whether they have items in stock. Even standard items can be missing from the shelves(2) their checkout system is chaotic and you can be kept queuing for a long time. They then open another checkout and people who have just arrived at checkout jump the queue and get served immediately. Crazy system. (3) if you can actually find a member of staff to help you they tend to be unhelpful, mainly because they are pre-programmed and obviously under pressure. It reminds me of something from Orwell's ""1984"". (4) Some of their products are low quality and you have to check everything very carefully e.g never buy their supposed ""heavy duty"" refuse sacks - they just tear and fall apart. In general it's a really poor shopping experience at Aldi. I accept that savings can be made if you are willing to accept poorer quality goods and sub-standard service but for me it's just not worth it to save a couple of pounds. Back to Morrisons and Sainsbury's!!",0,1

When I arrived at the store, I collected a shopping trolley, and began my shopping. Eventually I finished and went to the checkouts, where I off loaded all of my shopping onto the conveyor ready to be scanned. When I got to the cashier, I was told that there was NO carrier bags, not a single bag in the entire store.!! It was suggested that I could buy a cloth bag which would have cost me a further 0.65p. When I asked if they had a box, I was told ALL the boxes are broken down.I explained to the young lady that unfortunately I was walking, do not enjoy good health at present, & live about 3 miles from the store, so impossible for me to carry all that shopping without any bags. I was forced to leave my shopping at the checkout & leave the store. Fortunately there is a HomeBargians right next door, & so I was able to do all of my shopping there.It was very poor customer service, extremely embarrassing, & not something I will be doing again in the very near future.Back to Tesco for me I think.",0,1

This has never happened to any previous belt that I have ever worn. Usually the leather wears at the hole that is usually used. I wrote to Aldi enclosing the broken spine. They wrote back saying that products were only guaranteed for 12 months, and since I did not enclose a receipt could do nothing. So if you are shopping at Aldi note that products are guaranteed for only 12 months, and keep your receipt!",0,2
Aldi UK,ALDI IS LOSING IT'S UNIQUE SELLING POINT.,"Let's face it, the majority of people go to Aldi because it is cheap. However, just recently prices have been rising at an alarming rate. I would estimate that prices have risen by something like 25% in the past year. A much higher increase than the other supermarkets. If this continues it will soon lose it's USP of being cheap. What's the point of going to Aldi if you are not saving money ? You certainly don't go for their customer service. It's non existent. The same can be said for the cleanliness of the stores. Howard Street in Wolverhampton is dirty with soiled floors, and nobody seems to care. Be carefully Aldi. Your hubris and taking your customers for granted will be your downfall.",0,1

Aisles are also often partially blocked with trolleys. Fruit and veg has a much shorter life than other stores or my local greengrocers. Prices are quite competitive, but often at the expense of quality. It’s also rare to find a staff member who is not too busy to help. Finally, we can only use Aldi for top up shopping for a few good products because they don’t stock all we want for our particular full weekly shop.",0,2

Aldi UK,Another warning when shopping at Aldi.,Another warning when shopping at Aldi.Don't be drawn into believing that all Aldi's prices are better than major stores.It is very difficult to compare some prices as Aldi do not give the price per weight but by item.E.g. I bought 8 bananas at Asda and they cost 88p. Aldi's price for 8 is £1.12 which is over 31.5% dearer.When I bought bananas at Aldi I asked a member of staff how much banana's were per kilo she replied that Aldi do not do that.Also when I take into consideration that the nearest Aldi store is nearly 10 miles away so unless I need to go to that area I save nearly £3 shopping in my local Asda.As shoppers we have to wise up and compare products by quality and try things before we make comments.Many items in Aldi that are priced 'Per item' are definately more expensive than buying by weight in other stores.,0,1

Prices at Aldi are very reasonable and their returns policy is very good too.My gripe with Aldi is the rudeness off the staff. You cue at a checkout with long cues, other checkouts consistently opening and closing. Then the staff at times can be very rude, no thank you. Sometimes they are too busy speaking to their colleagues on their headsets about when their next break is than to acknowledge the customer. They practically throw your shopping at you making you feel most uncomfortable.So to sum up. Great food, good prices but rude and unwelcoming staff. The policy of the customer is always right doesn't go well at Aldi",0,3
Aldi UK,I was quite impressed with ALDI when…,"I was quite impressed with ALDI when they first came to the UK but that has very quickly gone out of the window. Firstly,the scam with private parking company's,where you get a parking ticket for parking your car to go into their shop to spend money,or in a lot of cases never actually enter the car park.I have had problems over and over again at their car parks,especially the shop in Horns Lane,Newbury Park,Redbridge. The scam here is blatant fraud,where the thieves than run the car park deliberately falsify the cctv to make it appear that your vehicle has been parked in the car park for up to 12 hours or more. When you ask for the cctv for times outside the times given by them they say it is not available but curiously the footage showing your vehicle entering at 9 am and leaving at 07.45 pm is,even though the vehicle left the car park less than a minute after entering at 9 am and the same at 07.45 pm .To explain further,the car NEVER actually entered the said car park but used the entrance/exit at the car park to perform a U turn,the reason being there is no U turn allowed at the A12/Horns Road junction and this is the only safe place to perform a U turn to rejoin the A12 eastbound. This occurred twice,once at 9am and again at 7.45 pm.My vehicle was parked in an underground car park at my place of residence between these times. These people are blatant criminals and Aldi seem to condone their devious practices,as they refuse to speak to these criminals and state it is not their concern.Just be aware that this practice is rampant at ALL Aldi car parks and between these devils at Parking Eye and others they are making untold money from these fraudulent practices (if you are stupid enough to pay their ficticious ""invoices"") One other thing to be aware of with Aldi is their Best Before Dates and also Sell By Dates.Having spent over £200 in Aldi a week before Xmas we have thrown over £60 worth of food in the bin because of short dates,in some cases only 2 days,so check everything you purchase very carefully before you leave their stores because this has happened at several of their shops,notably Collier Row. One other thing, I purchased a MEDION phone from these people a while ago and it has never worked properly from day one. After returning it to the shop where it was purchased they informed me that they had a no exchange policy after 4 weeks and that I should return it to Medion for repair/service. After contacting these no-nothings at Medion I was told that the phone should be ""reset"" but I told the bumbling loony that it had already been reset 4 times and that it had made no difference but he insisted. He then made a completely idiotic statement about updating it to a different version of Android,which was complete nonsense. I made a further visit to the Aldi store to explain what Medion had said and he said Aldi would look into it. That was 2 years ago.The phone is currently in a drawer,where it has been for that time.",0,1

Constant tanoy announcements closing & opening tills. Staff are rude & miserable. Shopping is almost thrown at you after scanning so that the customer has almost no chance of keeping up. Even if you ask them to slow down because you have a physical disability they rarely do or the speed change isn't noticeable. Some staff get irate if you are slow & make snotty comments about you needing to speed up. Often no room in packing area due to clutter of promotion leaflets & small children sat on sides.

I went back to the cashier for a refund and straight away she called for a manager. Within seconds he was there and I explained what was wrong and the cashier then gave me my money. However, I noticed the manager take the turkey into the shop and watched him return the turkey to the shelf. He seen me watching and quickly disappeared into the stockroom / warehouse. Just before the manager returned the product, he had spoken to another staff member. I approached her and explained that I had returned the turkey as it was rotten and needed to be taken off the shelf. Unhappily she said she’d remove it (even though she didn’t know exactly where it had been put back). I just hope nobody bought it and cooked it. Disgraceful practices.",0,1

It would appear that customer Service is just totally useless. It is breaking their own advertising standards by clearly putting on the order 3 - 5 working days. But no one in customer service has been able to tell us where this Hamper is or when it will be delivered, i leave my e-mail address and telephone number but no response. What sort of usless company is this to be allowed to opperate in the UK. Not all your customers are Zombies!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Very disappointing.,"Very disappointing.They use Hermes to deliver larger packages which is terrible as they are abysmal, there is no way you are getting the package without having to work very hard to get it.Their systems are inadequate as they have had orders claimed they have never happened and I have not received an Order number but they took my money.Customer support was unable to get any record of the order or address my concern of them taking my money with no record of my order.I then get a message that the package will be delivered today, shows that the order existed but not in their records, just shows they don't know something from there elbow.It is very disappointing as I generally do my weekly shop at Aldi but i will never use the online store again and starting to re-think my loyalty to there stores.",0,1

Aldi UK,Would be 2.5 Stars but can't,"It pains me to say this as i have been mostly pleased with Aldi but the quality has steadily dropped and i am at a tipping point now. I have always enjoyed Aldi food, some products are better than the mainstream brands. But Aldi have been removing various products from the shelves. Some still have the signs but have not been in stock for months now. I have been to 3 different Aldi stores in less than a week but still have not purchased all of the required products as they have been out of stock or removed from sale. One particular store was a mess with cardboard boxes all over the shop and stock mixed together on the wrong shelves. My biggest gripe is the customer service though. I have always taken issue with the speed they move at on the til. They rush you through and it is very efficient for them. But for the customer it is a rush to pack everything and you have to move double speed. Recently i have found some staff to be rude as well. starting to scan items before you've had a chance to even finish putting items on the conveyor belt. They also neglected to welcome you are thank you. They wanted to move you on as fast as possible. If the decline i am seeing is not fixed, i won't be returning. I'd rather pay more at Tesco for good service and to be able to buy what i need than get cheap items with poor service and no guarantee i will get everything.",0,3
Aldi UK,Beware cheap power tools and warranties,"I have tried to put a fair review on their own site for a drill/driver, but it appears they moderate out 1 star reviews.My Workzone impact driver broke after 4 months. They only provide a refund/return policy if 60 days in store, so you have to deal with the Manufacturer- a company called Worx.You must have your receipt, but even then you have to deal with the Customer Services who claim they need authority to make a decision from their Warehouse. Eventually, after three weeks they agree to collect the faulty drill via Courier. So I had to book a day off and wait for DPD to turn up. I now have to wait again whilst they check the drill and decide if they want to repair or replace.Now call me cynical, but do you think people give up because of this ridiculous system? I had to buy another drill because I needed one and could not wait for Aldi or Worx to sort it.I continued out of frustration and a desire for fairness. It cost me a days holiday (£130) and a lot of stress for a £39.99 drill.Now my review for them was not much different to this. I didn’t include my effective loss of earnings or the cynical paragraph... but they moderated it.Aldi, if you want only 5 star ratings, provide the products and service to justify it. Do not block off any reviews that you do not like.",0,1
Aldi UK,AVOID FRESH PRODUCE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!,"AVOID FRESH PRODUCE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!my friend recently bought a cauliflower which came with a added bonus of caterpillar, shortly after i went and proceeded to purchase onions of the natures finest brand. Sometime after consuming said onions I became violently sick to a degree mirgranes were insufferable and so was the gut wrenching stomach ache that is part of the process. You wouldnt believe the amount of effort to retrust aldi and once again walk through its doors, however I slowly started convincing myself it was a one off, a fluke, just a random happening, but this was not the case as after buying another pack of NATURES UNFINEST onions once again the violent sickness came around. This time i thought aldi really need to know about this and log the details of the packages i bought. Upon dialling the customer service department i was met by a person i can only describe as a wall, a wall designed to never accept responsibility on the companies behalf for any mistakes or upleasantries that occur on their behalf. after 30 minutes of the wall i was finally told to go and see a doctor, now i have never heard of a supermarket recommending medical advice as to not accept the blame for a dangerous product. At this point i feel hummiliated and disrespected on all account of customer loyalty as i have been a shoppper at Aldi for 12 years, Well done Aldi you have successfully demonstrated how cheap you really are.",0,1

Aldi UK,"Quality going down hill rapidly, lost another customer.","The quality of produce is getting worse and worse and noticed the pricing is creeping up. Fresh fruit is dry such as oranges etc...other fruits bruised, have to bin them. Meat in meals is fatty, poor quality even from they're selective range. Fresh bread is dry, not fresh even with a few days on best before. Also, watch the best before dates like a hawk, so often only has one to two days left, even on date of purchase same day best before. So many things wrong with Aldi now, they have grown far to fast and they now they think they have their audience, they can start to reduce quality out of greed. Just not acceptable, they clearly have logistic issues and cannot get the products to store fresh and in a good time frame. Well had my time with Aldi and the inferior products, some may be good, but end up binning so much food from Aldi now, not worth it if you make any saving, which is not the case nowadays. I shall be going back to the mainstream supermarkets, Aldi is not one. They clearly have no care for customer service, as do not even respond the the feedback here, which most companies do.

I cancelled my order and requested a full refund, only to be told that my refund would only be issued AFTER ALDI CONFIRMS CANCELLATION WITH THEIR SUPPLIER, YODEL, even though I paid no money to Yodel so shouldn't I have to wait.

Overall ALDI is great, ive recommended and all my friends now use ALDII have a had a few issues with Fruit / Veg took back and changed but ive had this in other stores over the years, seems on here people giving 1 star for things that happen in all supermarkets. Basically I used to be TESCO person and then M&S also. But i got ALDI near me that next door to an M&S and for a change we went into M&S and bought same kind of product you can get in ALDI even round tub instant mash as wanted something quick as was busy, it was well over double the price in M&S and was no better, so really if you can get it in your head that they are not out to compete with TESCO, SAINSBURY they are a different machine, no you cant get the choice or everything you want, but their business model is different, but what you can get is a shed load of food for a lot less money, and what you get is decent, some products are better in my opinion than other brands for a lot less, some are not maybe the same but still taste good. If you have never tried have a go, because when you come out with trolley load for like £90 quid that would cost you like £140 in others you then start to think!!! I do have one gripe with ALDI they get in some great products and then they disappear, its a bummer but then you may see them in six months again.",0,5

But as I have to ""do the school run"" I never get there until about 9.10 am. As the leaving time is about correct how come the time entering is incorrect, is the clock set to rip people off. I've been using Aldi for about a year now but never again I'll be going back to Tesco from now on. If this was a genuine mistake by myself I'd pay the fine and put it down to my error, but if you are taking your children to school you know you couldn't have been there at that time in the morning.

On a Saturday night recently I opened the Salt Grinder to salt our food as I had made a nice steak and chips, which we were looking forward to eating and then chilling out for the evening.However, as I peeled the film off the grinder, the plastic screw top had not been screwed on properly, so the majority of the salt went over our food. I took a photo on my phone and emailed it to Aldi customer services.I was very surprised to receive a call within 30 minutes from Aldi customer services requesting more information. I was advised this was a courtesy and this would be past to quality control. Good customer service I thought.I was left under the impression that I would perhaps receive a voucher for a new salt grinder and possibly a little extra to buy some steak, but I had not asked for anything.Today I remembered to chase this up so emailed them to advise that no-one had contacted me from customer services / quality control, only to be called back by the same lady. She advised me that the call she made was the end of the matter and that I would not be contacted by anyone else.Too be fair, I would have thought Aldi would have been at least keen to replace the Salt Grinder or even the salt to refill it.

The guy at the till called Roland ID number 25416 asked for ID I showed my ID which was a provisional driving license my age being 27.He then asked for my girlfriend ID she did not have hers on her but she is 21. He said we could not have the wine I said so even though I am paying you won't serve and she has car keys which we showed and he said doesn't matter. The guy before us even said what if I had my 3-year-old child with me would you ID the kid? Roland replied doesn't matter. The manager then came over she was very rude and abrupt and just said doesn't matter cant be served. I felt like leaving the whole shop at the till but I know that would not be fair on the other staff.I am sad there is no common sense at Aldi and I am disgusted at the service and will not be going to this store again.

Took chicken back today and received a free pack and refund of my original purchase, though as there is no customer service, the checkout girl had to sort the refund much to the disgust of the customer behind me who 'tut tutted' claiming she would now miss her bus. Yesterday I mentioned to checkout person about the slimy, putrid mushrooms and she simply shrugged her shoulders in a couldn't give a toss attitude.

She allowed me through, as i only had 3 items'.Silence.When i looked at his name badge, it said deputy manager. I must admit i stared at him, taken aback and then, when i had composed myself i said 'you're never the store manager'?He couldn't have been more than 20.It made me more determined than ever to continue my shopping at Tesco (despite the bad press).

Aldi UK,Aldi-land,"Though I shop weekly at Aldi it is by nature an inadequate shopping experience. Aldi (and Lidl) are the shopping equivalents of a battery chicken unit - frantic, intense, crammed and repetitive. Most of their products however are usually good or at least acceptable for the comparatively low prices charged. The exceptions to this seem to be Aldi's (and Lidl's) fruit and vegetables and their fresh meat and fish products - which are all of variable quality. Although to some extent that is the nature of fresh meat, fish, fruit and veg'. Overall, Aldi (and Lidl) help to keep prices down between themselves - and as a result also in the big four supermarket chains by competing. They do offer plenty of budget lines - thankfully without those horrible blank labels used on the big four's value ranges, designed to make you feel guilty for buying them. But as everyone knows, you won't find a cafe, seating, toilets, service desk, samples or many multi-buy offers in Aldi (or Lidl either) - and usually almost no 'sell by date' final reductions at all.",0,3

Aldi UK,Dangerous product - Adventuridge air tent,"I bought Aldi’s Adventuridge 4 man air tent and took it to a festival last weekend. The middle air support exploded at 3am on Saturday morning and the tent collapsed with myself, husband and 11 month old daughter inside it in torrential rain. Everything inside the tent got soaked including our air bed, sleeping bag and the bag the tent came in. We were not willing to load the soaking wet and damaged tent into our car and bring it home so I took photos showing the tent, the damage and the tent collapsed in the field and threw the tent and our other wet belongings in the campsite bin. Aldi have refused to accept any responsibility for the terrifying experience we had with their tent and will not refund the cost of the tent because I was not able to bring the tent back into store. I have written a review on Aldi’s website alongside 40+ other customers’ bad reviews warning that the tent is dangerous and should be recalled but they have deleted my review and won’t publish it. This speaks volumes. Really disappointed that they treat people this way and I would urge everyone to steer clear of their camping range.",0,5

I should think I have been shopping in Aldi on at least 500 occasions and I have never come across a single bad attitude from the staff, ever. They are the best.

They NEVER! have icecubes EVER!, Never have lemonade, only the cheap diet stuff that tastes like carbonated toilet water.. They take great joy in closing tills just as you put your bruised avocados and single bananas down as people find it exceptable to snap them off a decent bunch on the belt along with non existent ice and lemonade. Ironically they have signs hanging to tell you they will open a till if the que is long above your head, obviously bul##hitI have walked out of the typical ""Cardiff style"" aldi many times now.

My son was on the verge of wetting himself so I went to the till and asked a different staff member if she could call someone to the till to let us use the toilets as there were no other staff in the aisles.

Aldi UK,Absolutely disgusting,"Absolutely disgusting. I do my shopping at Aldi every fortnight spending average of £80 per basket. An average of £2000 a year and everytime I’m in Aldi, hodge hill, Birmingham, I am disgustingly rushed at the tills. Today I was at the till with my young 2 kids and upon asking the deputy manager for a minute so I can quickly pack my shopping into my already open bags in the trolley, he held me up for good 5 minutes very rudely explaining the policy about packing my shopping after I’ve paid for it, basically throwing into the trolley and then taking it out to bag it. As he carried on Humiliating me in public saying ‘ I should expect this kind of service in a budget supermarket’ He left me no choice but to leave my £80 trolley and walk out. I am persuing this incident further. Upon speaking to the security guard he mentioned that they behave like that with frail old pensioner shoppers too. On one hand they do advertising campaigns to bring in customers and the other hand their staff are adamant getting rid of loyal customers! According to their staff you can’t expect service at budget supermarkets! It’s a shame because the products are good but just not the organisation. And I would advise anyone looking to complain not to bother calling the customer service number where someone just listens to your complaint and I doubt they do much as they don’t even get back to you with any feedback or apology. After my experience with Aldi i will never shop in any of their stores again.",0,1
Aldi UK,Selling rotten meat and don’t even care!,"I’m traditionally an Asda shopper but recently switched to Aldi as needed to save a few pennies and the majority of their food is great quality. The hell of the tills takes some getting used to but it’s the price you pay for cheaper shopping. However, this week I was unfortunate enough to be sold chicken that had already expired. It was the smell I noticed first, and then the date! I had bought the chicken, full price, only hours earlier. I contacted Aldi simply asking for a refund. I had photos of the packaging and my receipt and it’s not a large amount of money (the grand sum of £2.50!) The Aldi store is not close to where I live and, with SchoolHolidays approaching I will be reverting back to online shopping for a couple of months, so didn’t want to have to spend a fiver on petrol for a refund of half the amount. Considering the meat was out of date and rotten, I thought Aldi would show a little concern and went to rectify this problem. I was wrong.They are flatly refusing to refund without me storing the product packaging for the two months until I return to the shop and get a refund in person. Since they broke the law selling me rotten expired meat, I find this a little off. But they are insisting that’s all they can do so for me, there will be no return visit. Not ever. Instead I will be making a complaint to the Food Standards Agency and let them deal with it. And I won’t be shopping any Aldi again. Luckily we have a new Lidl opening just a few minutes away from me in September so Aldi’s loss will be their gain.",0,1

Aldi UK,if you want to save money keep out of aldi and lidal,"Been going to ALDI for a while and brought what i would normally get from my regular supermarket like asda, morrisons. aldi is basically conning you every time you go there. many times i have brought things from aldi only to end up throwing it away and then buying it again from my usual supermarket. so this is happening on a regular basis and have ended up with no money left for the rest of the week due to paying twice for one item. Everything i have tried from aldi has ended up in the bin like the fruit and veg and you throw it away because the next day it stinking the kitchen out. bad rotten beef, chicken and other things far to often get wasted. Go to you regular store and buy your items for a penny or so more and enjoy what you brought and not having to throw it away wasting your money and ending up buying it from another shop and spending twice the money. ALDI, your a little company selling low quality goods and making money then the customer catches you out, aldi is rubbish and will cost you more money to buy the rubbish they sell so why do you keep going back week after week buying the same junk. go back to your normal shop and you may not have to throw anything away therefore your saving money in comparison to aldi when you have to throw it away. i have wasted thousands of pounds throwing out aldi rubbish and having to go somewhere else to get better quality and paying less for it, you do not need to go to aldi. save your money and keep your sanity because aldi will drive you mad when you want to pay for their rubbish food and you rush round for the check out only to find were closing this till so you end up in a big queue and then the till reopens a few seconds after. that drives me bonkers every time.customer service what is that???? phoned aldi many times but your wasting your time as they dont do anything to resolve the problem they created for you the customer and then they put the phone down. the mistake they make is i recorded every phone call i made to aldi and i can get them to send me these calls as i know the time and dates these call were made by me. aldi you are a terrible company wasting money on FAKE ADVERTS FALSE CLAIMS ant then you put your prices up . some thins in your shop are costing more from you than your competition. looks like another foreign company going to the dogs or has it already done that. no more money from me and the rest of you need to think what are you doing in a shop and you save 5 pence then you go home and the next day you throw the item in the bin and now you have waster £2.99. you could have brought the same item cheaper and eaten it saving you money. proof that aldi is NOT SAVING YOU MONEY and never will so stay well away from this terrible place and you will save money.maybe by this time next year aldi will have gone out of business pray god.as this other reviewer stated in a better way then me it seems this is happening all over the place, but i dont think we are disposable more like complete bloody nutters for going in to aldi in the first place.Appalling customer service . Closing tills when you are queuing at them ,sending you to wait behind someone buying enormous numbers of items then 30 seconds later announcing they are opening the till you were told was closing .They do it time after time .Aldi dont care about annoying their customers .We appear disposable",0,1

Aldi UK,stick to selling food etc not raffle tickets at the till.,"I shop with Aldi every week and find the value for money of most products excellent.However i agree with the other reviews about fruit veg and salad going off and far from fresh, I no longer eat meat but when i did i had to return meat many times as it was off within a day.I called into my local Aldi today and after paying for my goods i was asked by the cashier if i wanted to buy a raffle ticket £1 for charity i hadn't got any cash as i paid for my shopping by card, I really think Aldi should stick to selling food etc and not putting customers on the spot at the till point, I already have 2 charities i subscribe to each month which is all i can manage, I felt uneasy not giving and customers were looking, and the cashier was very off hand.",0,3
Aldi UK,3 Year No Quibble Guarantee - Not worth the paper it's printed on!,"Purchased two Medion Wine Coolers on 2nd December 2016 from Aldi Brandon Norfolk at a cost of £59.99 each. Good appliances with a no quibble 3 year guarantee. DON'T BE FOOLED! Guarantee means nothing. One unit went wrong about two weeks ago, just stopped working. Had sat in our dining room and worked well. Phoned help line and was told they would send me Parcel Force label so I could send appliance back for repair under the guarantee. Label arrived, had to be sent back to Medion AG, Essen, Germany. Had kept original box and packaging so parcelled up the appliance, took lots of photographs to show it was in very good condition and also show all the extra packaging I put into and around the original box. Attached label and customs declaration form, marked it fragile and took it to the main post office in Swaffham, Norfolk. Post lady scanned in label and took parcel, no problem. About week later received email from Medion AG, Essen, Germany to say that the case of the wine cooler showed cracks, dents and chips which had been caused by inappropriate treatment while in my house. Also the appliance had been insufficiently packaged and damage had been caused en route. Therefore a free repair within the 3 year no quibble warranty would not be possible. However, they would repair the appliance at a cost of £166.60. Over two and a half times the cost of a new unit. If I did not want to have the appliance repaired then they would charge me £26.08 for scrappage. To say I am a little bit upset is just the tip of the iceberg. I have been in touch with Lenovo UK which is the parent company of Medion AG but have hit a brick wall. They have waived the scrappage cost and will send damaged unit back to me free of charge so I can scrap it myself. What is the point of that. As I pointed out to customer services if the unit had gone wrong within the first year and had to be sent back to Medion AG, Essen and any sort of damage occurred during transit then you can kiss good bye to the guarantee. I have photographs to prove that the appliance was in very good condition before it was sent back. Medion AG have sent me photographs of the unit in Germany because I was thinking of claiming against Parcel Force and its European partners. The photographs show one little dent in the top of the unit which I'm afraid won't be sufficient proof to make a claim. So what do I do now. Off to see CAB and hopefully they will refer me to Trading Standards. Lenovo need to have a service centre in the UK or be able to return the appliance to the shop it was bought from. Once the appliance leaves this country there is no knowing what is going to happen to it and the slightest mark, scuff or dent and the warranty is null and void. I am not a happy person!",0,1
Aldi UK,APPALLING SERVICE! A COMPLAINT LETTER SENT TO ALDI..,"A COMPLAINT LETTER SENT TO ALDI... NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HEARD OF THIS! HAVE YOU?Dear Sirs, We do our weekly shop at Aldi and visit our local Aldi at Hobley Drive, Swindon, very regularly.Today, I must say I'm absolutely appalled at the way my wife and I were treated by a cashier at the checkout. I realise that in order to keep your costs low, your cashiers need to keep the checkouts moving, but to say to a customer that is queuing behind us with a few items to jump in front of us without at least asking if we would mind - is down-right rude. We are of the nature that we would always let someone with a few Items step in front of us if we had not already unloaded our shopping.Her explanation was that it is Aldi policy to queue jump whilst unloading to save time.(we had literally finished unloading!) If this is the case then I'm absolutely gobsmacked, as I have never in my life heard of such a policy. I await your response and if this proves to be the case, I will be shopping elsewhere, as I believe being treated with a little common courtesy comes before saving money.",0,1

Aldi UK,This shop is absolutely terrible,"This shop is absolutely terrible. I had the worst shop known to man. I first tried this shop earlier this year and was so disappointed by the quality. I didn’t return. However I decided to give them another go last week to which I was horrified. I pull meat out of the fridge to cook for my family 1 day after buying it with still 5 days within use by date. The meat stunk it was sticky, off and yellow. (chicken) I got on and opened up my veg which was mouldy. My potatoes were black!! Disgusting. The store was unorganised the staff were so rude I even debated leaving my shopping. I feel this part was even worse than my bad food. To be met by such ignorant people was awful. Never ever again!! Please be careful with this as like myself I have two young children to feed and my husband. This could have been a nightmare.",0,1
Aldi UK,"Penny wise, Pound foolish!","I used to be a convert of Aldi, but not any more. They have a modern store, good stock of everything you need and keen, keen pricing. I was ecstatic at first, saving ££££s. But then I started noticing I was having to throw fruit and vegetables away more often, much more often.I'd find rotten lettuce in the prepacked salads with almost a week left on the expiry date. Then I found mould on some sausages ruining my Sunday special - Toad in the Hole. A string of onions that I had bought to make an onion soup had to be all thrown away as they were all mouldy inside. The last straw was when I had a bad tummy eating one of their prepacked meals despite it having 2 days left on it. I investigated a matching one in the fridge and the cheese topping was sour/rancid.I can only imagine they're not storing the items correctly at their main depot or at the store, or both, but I'm spending more on replacing rotten items than I was paying for a proper shop from a main supermarket before.So, despite initially being impressed, I am now returning back to Morrisons. Aldi can be summed up by my title; Penny wise, Pound foolish. You save a few quid, but at what cost!",0,1
Aldi UK,Fruit and veg ....,"Shame as I use to like shopping there but standards are very poor. My concern is in relation to their fruit and veg. It seems every time we purchase bagged items, at least one item has completely perished or on its way out. We do try to check the quality which is clearly what Aldi are failing to do, but because the bags have printed material on them, it is difficult to gauge if the items inside are good. Aldi have this dreadful policy of asking you on your next visit to bring it up with the store manager for a refund etc. I think they know this is a laborious task and most people just can't be bothered when the moment has passed and not everyone visits on regular basis. I have emailed head office more than once for a more appropriate compensation but Aldi insist on their untried and unsympathetic response. We do shop at the other German supermarket and their fresh produce is far superior. I suppose this is how Aldi make profit by selling on sub standard fruit ad veg in the hope the faithful customer will turn a blind eye. Not anymore Aldi.",0,1

We've stopped buying fruit and veg from there due to the fact that it is mostly past its best. The staff are uncouth and I've heard swearing from them on three separate occasions now. Why do they employ mostly young people? The last time that we were there, which was around 18.30, it was very busy and there were cages everywhere with products in them for restocking. The tills were heaving with customers and it was difficult to get around the aisles, so much so that my wife had a panic attack whilst we were in there. Unfortunately, we are no longer in a position to use our favourite store due to financial reasons, but we do travel to Grimsby once a month to visit their germanic rivals and other low cost stores where the shopping experience is much nicer.",0,1

Instead of charging me 85p for the pack I had been charged 85p for each of the 6 pots amounting to £5.10 for the pack.. I wrote to customer services regarding both issues. Whilst they have agreed to a refund they are unable to transfer the money into my account. I have been a regular customer and have made numerous online purchases, paid for online. The only way I can get my refund is by returning to the store, which is several miles away and would take me over an hour.

Collectively, We've boozed our way through vast quantities of both cheap plonk and good wine, for about 100 years added together, and never had to tip the first glasses into the sink before. The response from the store manager was to put it mildly, ""there's nothing we are prepared to do if you don't like it"". He refused a refund on the second unopened box. 3 weeks previously, we had a similar response from customer services over 2 tins of tinned mackerel that contained just tomato sauce. Not even a refund when we passed images and item codes etc. Last week it was a Chinese crispy duck kit that was raw untreated and certainly had no spices in it whatsoever. Altogether, the feeling is this store has some cheap stuff because it's not very good, or been spoiled in some way. Their approach is that you the customer are going to be wrong, so effectively being told to sod off, that's exactly what we'll do and do all our shopping where there is some standard of service that can be expected when things are wrong.",0,1

She told me off for 'packing at the counter' and said I shouldn't be doing it. I pointed out two other customers who were also putting purchases into bags in their trolleys. I explained that I could pack the bags (all set out ready in the trolley) as fast as if I were placing them directly into the trolley. She was aggressive, saying that I still shouldn't be doing it. It was really embarrassing as other people in the que were staring. There was no intelligence or respect shown by this member of staff. She was glaring and raising her eyebrows. I have arthritis and find it difficult to bend down to get things in and out of my trolley, that's why I just drop items into open bags. Quick and simple. I always try to be quick and considerate of people behind me. I can't justify ever shopping at Aldi again. I have shopped there every week for years, but won't be doing so again.

It came across as desperate to get customers out of the shop as if the staff wanted to get off, but to start playing it 18 minutes before is very poor.Beware of this shop new in COTTINGHAM near Hull, If you dont want to feel pressurised into shopping then dont go in, because i guarantee it will drive you crazy,and for all the staff to be laughing at it,is not the normal ALDI standard, obviously their standards have seriously slipped in employing people to this store, all customers had seen them laughing at the announcement.Such a shame for a brand new shop, they got it totally wrong, I might go back to LIDL now instead,once you lose loyal customers its very hard to get them back.Also if you park in the carpark for more than 1.5 hours shopping you get fined £70.00 - I HATE THIS! do they want customers or what, would expect that from Asda not AldiNO REPLY TO ANY EMAILS YET VERY POOR GONE ACROSS TO LIDL NOW - CLOSER CHEAPER AND BETTER QUALITY ITEMS",0,1
Aldi UK,"Nasty, rude, & patronising checkout operator","OMG what a horrific friday evening shoping experience at Aldi in Stone Staffordshire...After weaving in & out of the shop assistants who were filling the shelves at the busiest time! with there enormous boxes that they leave in everybodys way!! I started to load my shopping onto the belt. Before I had a chance to get my bags ready to load my items, the idiot male cashier had my items piled high. He even put some on the floor by his chair!!!I asked him to slow down but he refused to, saying he couldnt & by the time he asked for my £95 bill he couldnt even open his damm till cos my items were covering it.I felt so angry, stressed, humiliated & upset by this horrible treatment i was receiving as a customer & My only wish now was that I didnt pay the £95 bill & wished I'd just walked away.... he would of had to explain why he was left with all the trolly items then & I would of told him to shove em were the sun dont shine!!Horrific experiance & ill never shop there again...To all you Aldi managers out there...WHY ARE YOU TRAINING YOUR STAFF LIKE THIS? Have you never heard of customer service skills??You will loose alot of custom if this carrys on, its not like your stores are even that great. Quality, price, choice... other stores are alot better & from now on Ill be shopping elsewere. Youve lost a customer.",0,1

I flagged this to the deputy store manager in Altrincham (26 May 2018) She was very unhelpful, patronising & showed zero initiative to resolve the problemAldi has always been a great retailer, but this one experience has really dinted my confidence. I would recommend everyone checks their receipts & their reductions very carefully if they visit the Altrincham store",0,1

Aldi UK,I will not return to that store again with my children,Absolutely horrendous experience whilst grocery shopping with my two young children this week. Despite both my children being well behaved at the checkout i struggled to keep up with the shop assistant as she scanned my groceries so much so my three year old was collecting the groceries from the floor as she throw them into the trolley without request ! This particular lady has displayed an aggressive nature before towards me which i have attempted to extinguish with humour or joviality obviously without success. after collecting my groceries and whilst walking away she then had the audacity to cal me vile. With my two impressionable children with me i chose to ignore her aggression at that point and not challenge her something that following the incident i have trouble coming to terms with despite knowing this was the better act of the two i still have the nagging thoughts that as it was so outrageous it should have been brought to the attention of the manager sooner. I would say that this is in complete contrast with other assistants in the same or other stores previously and that customer services acted professionally and appropriately at point of contact.,0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi Is Cheap And Nasty - Poooooor Quality!,"Aldi is cheap for a reason - its poor quality! We have had Aldi meat balls which have had bits of bone in. This really hurt a tooth when chewing. I contacted Aldi and they were not interested at all. If there is bone in the mince then you can only imagine what rubbish is chucked into the mincer. We have had milk that has gone sour way before its use by date.The fruit and vegetables only last a day before starting to rot. We've had sponge puddings from there, when we've opened the packaging they were mouldy!Aldi is cheap and there is the odd product which may be good value but Ive learnt, stick with a better quality supermarket, you actually save in the long run.",0,1

I was told not to worry and in 24hrs I would be refunded as everyone saw what happened( security, manager and staff). Today is 22nd of May and not refunded the £80 difference aldi has after balancing their account. I have been to llyold bank, they asked me to go to Aldi vice versa.

No reason to park at this 'out of town' store other than to go shopping so mind boggling as to why they want to lose customers like us. We appealed the charge using their online system that allows you to upload till receipts - which we did. We then got a letter saying that we need to provide evidence! However, there is no number to call them other than the automated payment line, no-reply email address. They must think people are stupid. I called Aldi customer services and they have a whole department set up for dealing with car parking complaints! They promised to get it sorted for us. ParkingEye are a scummy company - Aldi you need reconsider who you do business with. Remove the parking cameras and we might return. Until then Lidl here we come, enough said",0,1

Also there are loads of seperate delivery notes so were not even sure our delivery will turn up all at once. No courtesy call or communication whatsoever. Deliveries seem to be getting worse and worse these days. Can't get my head round it. Surely there has to be some sort of rule that holds these con artists responsible for taking our money without delivering the goods?",0,1

Aldi UK,CUSTOMER SERVICES APPALLING,"If there was a zero star then i would award it.We purchased 5 steak pies recently.They included visible gristle and the rest of the filling was very chewy .After contacting Aldi CS,i received a generic email telling me to take the box and receipt back to the store for refund,but as they had been thrown away i was unable to do this.Aldi thinks that just refunding you on inedible items is fine.They do not take into consideration the,time,effort,spoiled meal,petrol used for returning the faulty item etc.So i was fuming with their totally abysmal response,they could not care less about their customers.I then tried emailing the CEO,but the email was repeatedly undeliverable.I then stumbled across the Resolver website,run by Martin Lewis,this gives you another way of complaining.However within 12 hours i received a brusque reply saying basically get stuffed,you will not be offered any form of compensation.So as i said earlier they don't give a toss about their customers,and i doubt very much that anything will be sending my complaint to their quality control team,as they suggested in their generic email.So i will be switching my custom to Lidl from now on,and if i were you i would not touch any of their pies/pasties with a very long barge pole",0,1

That was three weeks ago and not a word, apart from a voice mail telling me they had confirmation of delivery.My partner and I would spend upwards of £150 each week in Aldi prior to this but we have decided to shop elsewhere now, so their lack of interest in their customers has already cost them £450 - not that they care :(.",0,1

Aldi UK,Disappointing customer service Gillingham High street,I was very disgusted with the customer service I was provided when I visited the Gillingham High street branch this afternoon. I asked for an item from their locked electrical cupboard before I got to the till and the floor manager told me to asked when I at the till. When I got to the till it took forever to get someone to come down. I went looking for the manager who I had spoken to earlier and came across a little young staff who was quiet rude after I explained I had been waiting for someone to go and get an item from the locked cupboard. She came back with the wrong item and I had to go back with her. The manager (she) and young little girl/staff need customer service training. The staff on the till was very polite,0,1

Aldi UK,XDP is harming Aldi's reputation,"Aldi, you need to dump XDP Express Couriers. They are trashing your reputation. I've found Aldi customer services team very friendly, understanding and helpful but what's the point if deliveries simply don't arrive? XDP are beyond useless. Nobody is going to object to paying a couple of quid extra to get items delivered by a reputable courier.

I have taken 2 days off work already and they plan to attempt a further delivery this week when I am at work. This company doesn't care at all about customers. You'd think they would be bending over backwards to help after the first mistake but no, they split the order in to 2 separated deliveries with different couriers, just to make the experience even worse. Even if you contact the CEO it takes nearly a week for someone to get back to you. Their good will gesture is £40 in online vouchers! Who the hell would want to go through this experience again. MFI would be proud of your service Aldi. I sincerely hope that you go the same way as them.",0,1

AAnd by the way, this is after trying to use it and finding that it would almost be quicker to plug the hairs out one by one!When I emailed ALDI customer services,they at first asked for the product number, as my attached online receipt was apparently not enough. Then they claimed that I had to contact the manufacturer and then, when I said that actually the warranty said that I could contact them or the manufacturer, they complained that my warranty photos were unclear (true but irrelevant). In the end, I went into an ALDI branch where they ended up refunding me but accidentally refunded me £5 too little. I emailed customer services and basically told them that actually they should have refunded me whether they could see the warranty or not. I went back to the ALDI branch and told them that they owe us £5. Luckily, the check-out assistant immediately sorted that out for us. Meanwhile, I am unable to post this revoew on ALDI's own site, as they say that you cannot mention customer services on there. When I removed all mention of any service issues instore and online, the review is apparently still not suitable for posting. I will take this further. Meanwhile, ALDI's customer service claim that they cannot process a refund without the product number (perhaps they mean the one I gave them on the 10th April after they asked for it?!) but I have told them that I have obtained a full refund at their branch now.

I then got a text from Aldi saying my items would be delivered. They arrived 2 minutes later. I did not accept the delivery because in the meantime I had needed to buy the items elsewhere.

I ordered a garden parasol on the 12th April as a Birthday present for someone that was promised for delivery on the 17th April and made sure my daughter was available all day for the delivery. The delivery did not arrive and neither was there any communication to advise otherwise. I was unable to track the delivery by any method, the tracking information wasnt coming up online, the telephone number given is either constantly engaged or if you do actually think you are getting through to speak to someone there is a generic ""we are busy dealing with other customers at the moment and we are unable to take your call"", call ceases. You can try this number 100 times and the same happens every time . I have emailed customer services at Aldi , no response!I tried to call Aldi customer services , constantly engaged . I then received an email and text from the courier that the delivery would take place then on the 18th April between 1.42 and 3.42 and had left the depot. NO DELIVERY! Again, someone waiting in for it. Neither has there been any further update from the courier or Aldi.I called Aldi customer services this morning and after waiting in a stack for 10 minutes I spoke to a very helpful and apologetic young man who said he would see what was happening for me and that the couriers would update me shortly and that my delivery would take place either today or latest tomorrow the 20th April. At the moment, I have little faith of this happening and if this is the case will miss the Birthday date . This experience has been very time consuming and extremely frustrating and I will NEVER use them again, nor my work colleagues or family members who have listened to what is going on. Next time I will go and buy it in store elsewhereTo update anyone who may be interested, today, Monday the 23rd, no garden parasol , no communication whatsoever from the courier or the second promised call from Aldi's customer services. Not only has this missed my daughters Birthday , it was a present for her, it was intended to shade my new Grandson for when they were able to sit in the garden , at 2.5 months old and with health issues.

Aldi UK,RUDEST ASSISTANT MANAGER IN ALDI CHAIN,"Went into Aldi Ramsgate last night at 6.50 pm. The store was very busy. When we got to the till, we had a full trolly. Only two tills were open. We were 11th in the queue! We became aware of a small lady who was tidying up bags etc. I walked over to her and asked if she would open a till. She stared straight st me and said “no” and walked off back to her tidying up. This lady was an “Assistant Manager”!! Great leadership qualities! She was rude & obnoxious. Why would only two tills be open on a Friday after work??the rudeness of the assistant manager was witnessed by a lot of people due to the very long queues!! There were two guys in Aldi uniform stocking the shelves. Why would you behave like this when you work in a very public environment. I wouldn’t mind, Aldi are a great company to work for and pay good wages. Thought they would be unindated with staff!! You seriously need to train your assistant managers to be helpful and not think they are better than everybody!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Please Aldi team see this. Thanks,What Aldi needs to do to be my election supermarket :1 start delivering fresh groceries . On the website there’s only products that don’t have much interest. We can have that at eBay or amazon. Aldi is famous for being cheap. How about doing the difference and give the costumer an outstanding service. Fresh groceries for good prices! That’s what we want all. I don’t have car I need fresh groceries for a good price.2 sort that website layout . Sort it out . Make it simple. 3 get the deliveries on time and correctly to avoid Complains.4 keep doing this - repeat business,0,5

Aldi UK,Appalling behaviour feeling disgusted,Unfortunately you can't review 0 or the store in Bradford would get that.Appalling behaviour by the manager refusing to help at till.Expecting customer to sort shopping out as quick as herself and once finished asking you to put your card in while I am sorting the shopping out upon asking her for help.She refuses to help and tells me to huryy up and pay or I will take the shopping from you and banned you I ask for a reason she gets the form for banning and starts filling.Shocked and amazed at ludicrous behaviour I get in touch with customer service they tell it is her discretion.Nothing could be done. Spent £1000s of my hard earned money.Nightmare experience,0,1
Aldi UK,poor customer service and removed my negative review,"just sent a review in for a purchase of 4 cases of wine, and because of the negative comments on their delivery and customer service they refused to publish it! Apparently you are not allowed to review their service, only the product so thats why the reviews are good - because they ""moderate"" them e.g. bin them.In my case, I ordered 4 cases for collection at a local point (£3 fee for some reason). 3 cases arrived which I collected, but the last case didnt. I contacted their customer service number and they said they would investigate and come back to me (no call). I contacted them again and was told that they had lodged a missing parcel claim and I had to wait 48 hours for the carrier to respond. I asked why and the person siad it was because they couldnt send another case because the lost one may turn up! They said they would contact me when the carrier had replied. Again I had no call so I had to call them a third time. The person told me that had a reply and I should have been contacted to process a refund etc. I asked if I could have the product as it was still required, and she then processed a new order which I will finally collect today.Two points for Aldi - call your customers back when you fall short, and dont tell them they cant tell others about poor service.Wont use them again",0,1

Today he received a email informing us that the hot tub has been delivered. I’m still waiting for the hot tub - poor communication, poor customer service. I would NOT recommend anyone ordering from Aldi’s items such as this. My husband has again been trying to make contact with Aldi’s a number of times today - we have had NO REPLY.

Aldi UK,Aldi bad experience! Never again!,"People work like robots, applied for job just recently and thought maybe is not that bad. After 4 stages of interwiew ( the last one was 2h free labour job nicely named a trial day😂 a had enough! ) If u not flexible forgot if u want more then 25h forgot. All the satge of interwiew was about team work & excellent customer service. 😂 joke! I have been treated as animal on my trial day with no explanation about anything they ask u stack shelves in a speed like robot! Plus I heard menadzer telling off people about picking products after dates, straight at the front of customers. Really? This is your way of excellent customer service???? They ask me for 2h to put veg and fruit on shelves in heavy boxes for free! With no explanation about their rules. After I applied for job there I would never ever shop there again. Cheap shopping but staff is treated as animals! And if u think they care about customer, forget too. Might not see it until u for a trial day job to work there! I would rather shop in my local shop and pay more than every again go to Aldi. Sorry worst company in the world and as I know now how they treat staff I don’t want to even shop there. Sorry, cheap products comes with cheap labour but not only and at the end of the day I am human, will not visit again as opposite to the staff there it is not only about money.

Aldi UK,No more.,"I am very aware that the prices are reasonable, but that is not enough for me to continue shopping with Aldi. When navigating the shop floor you have to dodge staff manoeuvring large crates of stock as they try to replenish the shelves. Some staff at the tills are very stressed and agitated if the customer takes too long getting their money or card out. Goods are pushed through at a rate of knots making it extremely difficult to put them back quickly enough into the trolley and while you're trying to do just that you hear 'cash or card'. I shopped in Aldi yesterday and it is to be the last time. As I queued a man asked if he could go before me as he had Lucozade and what looked like chocolate. I agreed somewhat confused as my groceries were not that plentiful, only to be astonished when I saw that he was a member of staff! He was appreciative but this is simply bad manners and poor customer service. When I came to be served, my four pint milk container was being spun erratically by the customer services assistant, as I placed my trolley in situ ready for the stressful collecting of my purchased goods. As I got my purse from my handbag the assistant was tapping his fingers loudly on the till in an agitated manner. I have learned that staff are given targets relating to putting goods through the till. So therefore this bizarre unacceptable customer service lies firmly with the company and management. I would rather shop at other supermarkets, pay more and have a decent shopping experience.",0,1

The cost of shopping is way cheaper than Asda, Morrison’s or Tesco. I would recommend any who shops and bigger stores to go to Aldi instead As it’s a money saving benefit and all there produce is all British and very well priced, I won’t shop anywhere else it’s just brilliant and I would say to anyone I know to start shopping at Aldi it’s awasome 👍😀😀",0,5

Today 02/03/2018 i went there again to get some croissants for my litle one and when i did approach the counter the same manager told me this till is closed... i told him if he owns the store just because he is the manger, and how rude he is, after that he told all the other employers not to serve me and the security come to me and ask me to leave the basket, this is very bad for a brand who is one of the sponsors of british athetics, and so many awards, managers like this dont care because this newtown branch has many foreigners and he things hes above the law with this atitude. i call customers srvice explain my complain, and went to another store to buy those croissants for my girl.to be honest people like this dont deserv a job, are rude bad spoken, attitude and the funny thing they own the store, because they can say not to serve me. one star is to much",0,1

Aldi UK,Shopping pushed onto floor again,Good shop. Manageable size of store with good quality products. The range of products is good and improving.The one area of using one of these stores that is very poor is the checkout. Checkout staff performance in time taken to checkout a customer is recorded and they are held accountable for it. The result is that your items of shopping are scanned and then pushed up onto a tiny workspace. Several times now items of my shopping have been nudged off and onto the floor. It’s at its worst if you shop with a basket and don’t have a trolley to load items into after they’ve been scanned.,0,1

When asked to stop, she ignored us and continued to gossip with her colleague doing the same again. When we complained again she informed us that 'this is what we do'. Im disgusted, Ive just paid good money for my food to be thrown on their manky floor. Theyre quite happy to take customers money with complete disregard for the customer. Dont comply to their own ethos do they. Poor show Aldi. I'm not expecting a reply because I don't think they could care less.

Aldi UK,Awful place to shop. Not visiting again.,"Hounslow Branch 25 Feb 2018Awful place to shop. I was a completely innocent shopper and on both my visits have been treated very badly in full view of others,On my first, in Hounslow branch, I was rudely called back upon my exit because their security system bleeped.The security guard , ICO employee, shouted "" have you got any meat?"" I politely said ""no, I have nothing"". He looked into my bag and then simply walked off after being rude when I told him he should be more polite, especially as I had not broken any laws. He was not able to speak some basic English. Is this the kind of person security firms employ? I complained to Aldi, only to get a standard reply but did not press the matter. Aldi could not care less about my custom. I am not for one moment believing they would miss my custom. They have hundreds of bargain seeking customers willing to line for ages to save a few pennies. I am insignificant to them, and their treatment of me says that too.Some weeks later ( 25 Feb 2018) the same Security guard in Hounslow stopped me and shouted for my attention while I was on the public pavement some meters way from the store beyond a car park. Up until this point, I was having a very pleasant day. Their staff ruined my day.and I had not even done anything wrong! This time I was not so polite as his attitude and behavior was awful Tthis time I was not going to be treated so disrespectfully by him as he had his time a few weeks before when I remained polite despite his mistreatment of me ,He shouted "" whats in your pocket?"" and I showed him an empty Asda carrier bag and called him an idiot which he clearly is. How much can you get inside a pocket? Any why was I stopped on the public pavement. Why did he not challenge me earlier? I asked him why have I been stopped in this way . He responded by saying "" they told me to"" . ""who"", i asked and he did not reply How ridiculous. He was very aggressive and rude. And to someone who had not taken anything. I went back into the store after a couple witnessed how he treated me and suggested I should speak with the store manager. The Manager listened and said he would speak with him. The Assistant manager intervened and he actually started suggesting I may have done something wrong and there is "" always two sides to a story"". I asked him to clarify, he could not.I told him I had not shoplifted He stated they would look at CCTV. I He was a complete fool However, the fact is I had not shoplifted nor have I ever done so . He was actually trying to wind me up and I could see no reason why he would want to do that. In my opinion, he is a complete idiot, and an unpleasant one too. Some idiots are nice, so its so easy to be forgiving towards them, but this man was a nasty piece of work, totally careless. . He stated many things simply designed to make the situation worse. I wonder how he would have felt if he was in my shoes. Mistreated not once, but twice, and I had done nothing wrong at all. If this is the way Aldi operate, I can comfortably stay away. I shop in many places, and this is the only time I have been treated like this. I am in and out of Asda, Tesco and others for years and not once have I had any issue. Aldi, I have been less than 10 times, and this is what I get, That says something. I will not be visiting again. I am not desperate to save a few pennies.I actually only went in recently due to heavy advertising on TV. Im not going to miss anything. Asda, Tecso and Morrrisons do it all and the staff are pleasant. Ill stick with them from now on. Not once have I been challenged by their security staff so it seems they are better trained and more observant.In any case, it is hardly a pleasant shopping experience. Messy store and big lines. The Hounslow branch is a disgrace. They may get a lot of shoplifting ( the manager stated this ) , but their guards need to challenge those that actually are shoplifting, not innocent members of the public who exited after buying nothing. Simply making good days, bad days. I have complained again about him, and the wind up merchant Assistant Manager in Hounslow. I expect I will get another standard reply. In any case, I will not be going back. Two visits and two of my days ruined because of two unpleasant men in Aldi.Update:I received a response by email saying it is Aldi policy to carry out random checks on customers for shoplifting. Still, being stopped on a public road away from the store is hardly a random check! Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsburys, Wilko, Debenhams etc dont carry out random checks like that. I wish I had never walked into that awful place. They treat customers when they are not even that good a shop.",0,1

Aldi UK,"Poor customer service, supervisor level and management a JOKE!, Rude and arrogant!","Dear Customer Service Team,Store location: Countess Weir Exeter,Account Reference: I am writing to you to make a formal complaint about your staff and the poor attitude I recently encountered. As a customer facing organisation I would expect you to understand good customer service. To explain this in more detail I have been very upset by the service shown by a checkout man named Jason in this branch. I as I always do, put my shopping in order from heavy to light on the conveyor belt, I must admit my normal Aldi branch I shop in is Alphington Road Exeter, where the staff are so friendly and polite. I had a shock at the new store in Countess Weir. I put large bags into the trolley to pack my shopping as it gets scanned through, this saves me as I'm disabled loading the trolley again and lifting heavy bags, I have never had any issues my my normal store but today I left so upset and by the time I had gone through the check out man, a supervisor and a manager I could have cried. I am a disabled lady and my daughter had taking me shopping, whilst my groceries were going though, so fast that I couldn't keep up, I asked him to slow down, to which he did not! I am a ITP sufferer which means I have internal bleeds my health is dangerous, Jason was piling and just stacking my goods anywhere and everywhere till the point came that I couldn't get hold of the carrier bags I purchased because he had piled huge amounts of shopping on top and more shopping on top of that. Whilst he went so quickly I had to stop packing, I told him to slow down as all my shopping was being piled high, about to fall of the checkout and my soft items getting squashed. I shouldn't have to explain my personnel private health issues with anyone, I thought being a customer server he would have listened and slowed down or even offer to help me, but instead I got a mouthful of rudeness and arrogance, I really couldn't believe I was being spoken to in this way. I asked to speak to a manager where a young girl came over and was so rude and sarcastic that her customer skills were appauling. She smirked and smiled at the checkout man (obviously finding it funny, I can guarantee you this was not funny!!) when I was trying to explain the situation, I asked her what she thought, I had no apology but a lot of sarcastic remarks regarding how the checkout worker was the best Aldi has and she didn't believe what I was saying, she never once looked at me, I said I'm a unhappy customer which her reply was 'so'! With that attitude I knew she surely couldn't be the Manager, so I asked her rank, she was a supervisor who walked off and there were smirks given and no apologies. I asked for the Manager for a second time to be greeted by Glen, again no apologies for being upset or helped, just that he would take Jason in to look at the CCVT, I said I hope he did. I explained to the manager that just a few tins of food being passed so quickly could and would have smashed into my hands where I would instantly have a internal bleed. Answer to me was ""He wasn't to know"" well Im sorry just because I am not an old lady in a wheel chair, this is a life threatening illness where I am a patient of a cancer ward and has been for 23 years. Im horrified, in all my years of being a wife and mother and a grandmother I have never met a store so rude and arrogant. I will not be shopping with Aldi again. This has upset me profusely and so my daughter. What happened to great customer communications. This check out man was still being rude and arrogant as my daughter and I tried to leave the store. I hope there is cctv footage and i hope there is sound to it, because its disgraceful way to treat your customers. This occurred on the February 24th, 2018.To resolve this issue I would like your company to review this and take what action is necessarily needed, and hopefully someone will contact me. It comes down to speculation again, I wasn't in a wheelchair today, one of the very few I'm not. Shouldn't every customer be treated the same and with respect!?. I am extremely disappointed with your organisation at this time and I expect a response to my correspondence within at least 3 days. I find it reasonable to be resolved within 14 days. If this is not the case, I will be escalating my case. Please reply to my resolver email account as I would like to keep all of my communications in my personalised complaints case file.Yours faithfullyElaine Woolacott",0,1

Please do not offer a service you cannot live up to, choose a more reliable courier, over promising and undelivering is the bain of modern life. I won’t recommend or reuse until you make better choices with your suppliers.Update, trousers arrived just in time, obviously a return from someone as they have a cigarette burn in them .... too late to do anything now I will have to use them but will be on the warpath with Aldi on my return !",0,1
Aldi UK,These people have awful customer…,"These people have awful customer service, they assume because their prices are low they can get away with being rude and disrespectful. More fool you if you shop there and give them your loyalty because it will not be returned. On more than one occasion my family has had their staff embarrass them by being rude and forcing their bogus policies that have not even come into arrest yet. They give you parenting advice when they don't even know you and make you look stupid for asking a question. Their ques are too long and you are basically an irritation to them whilst they are locking the aisles with their pallets. I would rather walk 2 miles to our other nearest supermarket than give these people my custom.",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi is an amazing store full of welcoming staff who always put a smile on your face !,"Aldi is an amazing store full of welcoming helpful staff , I went with my mother whose 69 and they were very helpful and would be looking out for her , the Aldi is very clean and has lots of amazing offers on at the moment all the food from Aldi is fresh we bought some strawberries that wasn’t going to go out for like 4 weeks so definitely head on over to Aldi !! I would especially suggest the store in bebington !!",0,5
Aldi UK,Many staple items missing,"Aldi have always been erratic about stocking basic essentials, preferring to give priority to random junk in the middle aisles. Items I have struggled to find at both Radford and Bedworth, Coventry include: razor blades, tinned grapefruit, powdered milk (the last two never now stocked), porridge oats (intermittent), gluten free bread and biscuits (apparently now discontinued, amazingly), rice cakes without a sickly yoghurt or chocolate coating. Considering they stock such strange items as vegan energy balls, it would be interesting to see Aldi's stock policy, if such exists. They seem unsure whether to be an end of line discounter or a responsible supermarket with a reliable range. The ending of gluten free bread etc. means that I will revert to Tesco for my main shop. Store staff are mostly unhelpful when I raise these concerns.",0,2

Aldi UK,very rude and aggressive staff,"very rude and aggressive staffvery, rude and aggressive staff - doncaster athron street store, made a complaint via CEO, and the area manager gave a very weak response and offer of 15 pounds in vouchers. Not interested in vouchers, this company needs to get its staff educated in customer relations and spend less time throwing customers literally through the tills when they are already struggling and then think it is ok to shout loudly at a customer across the shop floor in a power trip. Oh yes, and being told i may be shoplifting because I didnt have my EMPTY trolley near enough to the checkout ( it was literally a couple of inches and could be clearly seen inside). The so called quicker experience and staff rudeness is not what a customer wants and this company has it wrong. We will never shop at any aldi store again and reading stories here it seems others agree. Rudeness and a don't care attitude is not a fair trade off for lower prices...disgusting.",0,1
Aldi UK,"Less ""content"" of an ingredient but no reduction in price?","I am beside myself, almost to the point of tears, with Aldi and their Ballycastle Irish Cream.It is the alcohol content that is the issue. Aldi have given their Ballycastle Irish Cream a nice new lablel BUT have reduced the alcohol vol by a massive 17% from 14.5% vol to a measly 12%.I might have been less upset at not being able to get ""sloshed"" without consuming a lot more of the new version of this Baileys substitute;. If Aldi had reduced the price of the new version of Ballycastle Irish Cream by 17%, to match the reduction in alcohol content, that may have softened the blow to my realisation I will have to drink more to get the same effect, but alas Aldi haven't done that.What am I to do?

Delivery was through Parcelforce, so that was very fast and efficient and I received Text alerts beforehand, which were very helpful.I've only tried one bottle, but that seemed pretty good to me.Only downside for me was they don't take Amex, which all of their competitors do.",0,4
Aldi UK,Online Order - Baby Furniture Set,"From start to finish ordering from Aldi has been an hard, difficult and outrightly stressful experience. At every stage Aldi have made mistake after mistake, resulting in me having spent hours on the phone to them and their appointed courier. Throughout this both Aldi and the courier has blamed the other for situation and offered no practical solution. To summarise the experience I have included a copy of my initial correspondence to Aldi customer services below:---Good Afternoon,I want to express my disappointment at my experience today. Being passed between yourselves and your courier has now taken up over an hour of my day, with the only solutions being scripted back to me being a refund or taking a day off work at 1 days notice to take delivery of my items.Firstly- Aldi offered a Saturday delivery at the time of purchase - and based on the fact myself and my wife work full time this is why we selected it. This is the expectation you set and promoted and it should not be me as the customer who loses out and gets passed between pillar and post simply trying to recieve the goods i ordered in good faith from a retailer i have always supported.Secondly the inflexibility of the courier, who cannot even break it down to a morning / afternoon delivery slot is seriously out of step with modern standards. Coupled with this they are also unable to tell me when they are next in my area - continuing the cycle of 1 days notice to take a day off work. I even offered to drive to the depot and collect the items - I simply want a solution.What can you do to help me receive the items? What can you do to help? I do not want a refund, just to get hold of the items I ordered at a time that can be planned so as not to force a day off work - something I think is a fairly reasonable expectation.---To top this off, the courier then delivered without any notice and forced 150kg of furniture on my neighbours mother - filling their hallway and posing a risk to the two todlers she was caring for. When I pointed this out to Aldi, they suggested it was my neighbours fault for accepting the delivery.Final insult to injury was that the furniture was damaged when I unpacked it. I then spend nearly two hours on the phone to Aldi only to be told the courier (who has lied and failed to do any of the agreed steps So far) would contact me about collecting. Something which is likely to be over two weeks in the future as they will not give more than one days notice of when they are in the area or even a rough timeslot so that this could be planned for - anyone working full time is again expected to take a day off at the whim of Aldi's appointed supplier. Repetitive, scripted, unhelpful and no sense of responsibly for fixing the mistakes, discomfort and inconvenience they have caused throughout. We are now out of pocket, having to squeeze through our front door (great for a pregnant lady Aldi!) and unable to work on the nursury until we get a refund - which I have not idea when that will be. Thanks Aldi - great to know you care so little for your customers and resolving the problems you create for them.",0,1
Aldi UK,Horrific Customer experience at Coventry Gallagher store,"I visited this store today for the 1st time and I got a horrific customer experience. When I got near the till and there was only 2 tills serving out of 5. Then it was announced till 3 will be opening just then I started off loading my shopping on to it, 1/2 my shopping on and am still staking the rest to the front one of the staff came over n said oh u should have started from the front of the till so other shoppers can load off too. I said on to him well there isn’t any space for another person to off load n there is no one here to serve me anyways. This staff who on his badge is called Michal said ‘well that what Customers should do ‘ I said to him I can understand that if there was a person ready to serve me but there was no one I am off loading and waiting to be served . And obviously more people start to queue and Michal then went on the till to serve me . So he did she me putting my shopping on but didn’t bother to start the till . ( and from previous experience at my local Aldi store they don’t start scanning your shopping till you have finished off loading and actually come to the from so you can start reloading ur own shopping back on) so if this is even the case and Customer concern was at the heart of his agreement shouldn’t there have been more tills open , 2 should he have not offer to help me off load early or start scanning the idea . I do not even expect to be assisted at the checkout . And when they can clearly see you need help . is simply Customer service too much to ask for . There were a few things even with my trolley full that o wants but did I see any staff to ask NO . So Michal as a duty manager without embarrassing me in store should have do something bout getting my shopping processed quicker and if there is a specific rule in that store then this should be clearly displayed. When I asked for senior staff he too me the store manager wasn’t about I asked if there was anyone senior a lady came over she had no badge on and I asked she was the store Manager she said no her name was Safina and she is senior , when I explained she said her colleague was right to tell he to stack my shopping from the start of the till . When I told her that I was the1st at the till and after offloading all of my shopping and still waiting for a checkout staff to come I was told to start from the front with no space at the front anyways. Safina then said I was speaking loudly at her . This horrific me even further because here I was trying to explain a scenario to this spoused manager who is now also accusing me off speaking to loudly. At this point I have had enough blaming from this 2 and didn’t want to subject myself to further embarrassment I ask for her name because I wanted to put in an official complaint. When I finished packing my shopping she brought me a form to put down my details which I declined. This may or may not be taken into consideration. But the least I expected from an Aldi store was to be embarrassed in front of othe Customer for loading my trolley full of shopping and be told I haven’t left space for other to load their shopping considering I still have more that needs to go on still and no checkout staff at the Till. Michal and Safina are disgusting people in my opinion and lack basic customer service. I wouldn’t say I am not going to shop at Aldi but I will just stay well away from the Gallagher store.",0,1
Aldi UK,Shocking customer service,"Edit : customer services review after incident stated below, a manager did phone me back and pushed for a resolution unfortunately xdp had smashed the Cotbed to smitherings going from pillar to post. A refund was issued today but they have redeemed themselves by contacting a local store and reserving the item there for me. People who spoke to me this time much more helpful I’ve edited from 1 star based on yesterday’s experience to 3 star. Hope Aldi refuse to use Xdp couriers in future.Shocking customer service! To echo what the previous reviewer has said. Spoke to Charlotte at Customer Services as I’m still awaiting a Cotbed that I paid for on the 16th January.. after several phone calls to them and their choice of courier service I still have no Cotbed. I complained I had waited too long for the delivery and wanted a refund so I could purchase from elsewhere only to be refused a refund until the item had been delivered, I reminded the lady the reason I was asking for the refund was because I had no delivery! I asked to speak to the manager and she said “no the manager will only tell you what I’m telling you” put me on hold for 30 seconds came back and said the manager won’t speak to you... honestly. Going to have to pursue this with my debit card company and drop an email to Trading Standards. A refund is a legal obligation and a massive firm like Aldi should know better still furious! Avoid Aldi online at all costs happy to take your money not so happy to provide you anything let alone a decent customer service!",0,3

Shock of shocks no call , so I called today to be told they had not had a response from XPD so didn’t call as nothing to tell me , I asked if there was a wardrobe available in my local store and they advised that there was, so I requested that I would pick that up and that would replace the one owed to me, but no no no, that can’t happen as I would have to pay for the one I store as online is a different department but the same company !!!, I said ok well I’ll cancel my online order then so refund my money only to be told 5hat they couldn’t until they finish their investigation!!! They could not get 5he concept that my contract is with Aldi not with their courier, and the girl I spoke to would not put her manager on as “ he couldn’t tell me anything different” ended with being told that they will call tomorrow, won’t hold my breath, one thing for certain I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ONLINE FROM ALDI AGAIN",0,1

Aldi UK,Aldi Wine,"This review concerns Aldi’s wine sold in the UK.Living at some distance from town means that we rely heavily on home deliveries, especially for larger or heavy items. We enjoy a glass of wine from time to time and so we have tested many of the options for home delivery in recent years. Aldi meets our needs with excellence and at a price significantly lower than many of its competitors. The range of wines is good, it would be nice to see more French options but as Aldi is not uniquely selling wine we don’t consider the lack of less well known grape varieties sufficient of a problem to reduce the 5 star rating. We have never received a bad bottle from Aldi and we have been pleasantly surprised by some new to us varieties that we will certainly buy again.We rarely spend more than £10 a bottle at Aldi and in fact there is a good range of options at less than £5. Free delivery is offered, wine arrives via Parcel Force usually just a couple of days after the order is placed. It is possible to arrange delivery on a specific day for those needing such precision. Bottles are well packed whether bought by case or individually. It is a pleasure to leave this positive review, there is a great deal that some of the specialist wine stores could learn from Aldi’s example. We have been buying wine from Aldi for a couple of years now and while we will no doubt try others in the future I can’t imagine finding a better service or better value for money.",0,5

Could not believe it when I saw the prices Aldi were selling pods for online (great, as my nearest Aldi is way across London!) So having read the rave reviews, I got in touch to check the prices, and they got back and turns out yup, they really were a tenner for 60! So with not much to lose I ordered the caramel and the decaff. Am amazed! They arrived promptly, pod lids are foil so pierce easily and the coffee itself is LUSH. Seriously.

My Mother in law used to love shopping at Aldi but can't because they are bringing pallets out during the day leaving no access for wheel chairs or Mobillity scooters. ,There is also no toilet facilities so if caught short one as to wait, overall staff and shopping is great but loses one star because still room for more improvements, I like some of their special products and price rise they are brilliant and 90% of staff and management.

One item was their special label own brand item and it was a rib of beef, it was suppose to be used by the 28th of dec. Come the 28th I take it out of the fridge to cook it because it's suppose to be no good after the date and to my horror I find it has gone off at lest 1-2 days before the best used by date contacted aldi only to be told it's a chill factor issue (basically blaming me saying I did not keep it cold enough etc which is bull as I went from the store to my home and the item was in a cold bag plus it was freezing cold that day to!) and saying if I don't have a receipt or they can't find the receipt on their system (chances are the most likely won't) then no refund will be given. I normally keep all my receipts in case of issues like this but this time I believe my other half has thrown it away. still tho aldi should be a little more understanding specially on special own brand products that go off before the use by day. In this case I was blamed for the food going off and basically told good luck with a refund of any kind.and it's not just the item going out of date before the date and issues over a refund either over the last couple of months meat products on their shelves have been going bad before the use by date. products like fresh fruit and veg half the stuff is rotten in the packaging or the lose boxes and when I politely let them know they basically act like it's not their problem or they give a we will look into this and walk away and who knows if they even do. and this past summer we went to buy cat food and bugs were all over the boxes of cat food, these bugs were hopping around and my first thought was fleas and i'm leaving told them about it and was given the look of a dog hearing a dog whistle a grunt and a muble of someone will look into it.

Aldi UK,Aldi,"I would give this place NO STARS. I really don’t know what the fuss is all about? Dirty untidy store selling mostly rubbish. Their so called ‘specials’ are MORE EXPENSIVE than their rivals. There was so much Christmas stock on display- literally hundreds of mince pies, decorations and puddings which had remained unsold after Christmas. There was washing detergent quite near to foodstuffs and the fragrance was overpowering. Clothes,shoes kitchen utensils and appliances strewn in no order in metal crates. There were pallets of stock obscuring items on display making it very difficult to access items. I’d only selected a handful of items and was horrified to find only ONE till open. The queue was unacceptable and every other customer had a query over something they were buying which slowed things down even further. Each time a problem occurred, the cashier would press a button where a recorded announcement would be played over the PA system requesting a manager to attend. I wondered why recordings were being used as I had never heard this before in a shop. It became clear that a possible reason was that the employee could not speak English very well. I decided that I wasn’t going to wait any longer. I left my basket on the floor and walked out of the store.

So now they deem its perfectly acceptable to check loyal, law abiding customers just 'in-case' they might be a shoplifter. Sorry Aldi, but total fail, this is not how good customer service works and I will be voting with my feet and will not shop in the store again till your archaic practices are rescinded.",0,1
Aldi UK,Randomly asking if I had any articles I hadn't paid for in my Tesco hopping bag,"On 23rd December I was asked in front of other customers whether I had retained items I hadn't paid for in my shopping bag, which I had purchased from Tesco Ludlow. 4 items to be precise which items are not carried in Aldi. I was just doing a little top up shopping, and was asked whether I had anything else in my Tesco hessian shopping bag which I hadn't paid for. They were implying, in front of other customers that I was ""shoplifting"". I complained. Apparently this is policy to randomly ask customers whether they have any unpaid items in their shopping bags. I am not a conspicuously excessive consumer, the items I purchased from Aldi amounted to £12.13. My experience (as I pointed out in a survey) is usually pleasant as it was this morning, but on 23rd, I was astonished at the implied accusation of shoplifting. Aldi telephoned me this morning, and said they would look into it. No apologies, just stating, as I was told on 23rd December, ""they were just doing their job."" Apparently it is policy to ask people if they have placed all items to be scanned for due payment........ I questioned the lady. I pointed out it was a Tesco bag, which had purchased made in Tesco stores opposite Aldi, earlier, she said, ""oh some people put items in their shopping bags ..... to save time."" I had a trolley, due to being disabled, which helps with mobility, which I had placed my items to into. ""Why would I put some shopping in my Tesco carrier bag and the remainder in the trolley before placing it on the check out for payment."" I replied. If their job is to be offensive, this woman did so, commendably. I am a Great Grandmother with personal integrity and have never been so offended in public before.",0,1

I have now been waiting 3 days for a response from Aldi Customer Service as to what they propose to do. I think its unreasonable to expect a customer to wait whilst they conduct their own investigations with Yodel. Either refund or send out a replacement. Sadly this is not the first time this has happened. My previous order of wine I had to wait 2 weeks for only to be told, after some chasing, that some bottles had broken and it was returned to the warehouse.

Even though we are saving money the quality of the products we are now able to buy has improved. Luxuries like smoked salmon and 21 month matured Parma ham for example. I used to work on a deli counter so I can tell quality when I taste it. If you are looking for a treat you can get goose crown covered in bacon with chestnut stuffing (£9.99) which easily fed 3 people who like generous portions. And I've just discovered their chocolate coated macadamia nuts £2.99. Delicious. So nice in fact I bought 10 cans as stocking fillers for my family this Christmas.

They then called the local branch to ascertain if there was a replacement locally. No was the answer- seems the local stores all have the same YELLOW items unsold. So the outcome is Aldi will refund the items if I take them to the store or return them to the on line store. And as a gesture they will send me a £5 store voucher .. however that does not help me as I’ll have to purchase a complete new ski outfit at over £80.I’ve been using Aldi for years and their products and services are usually good value for money .. but as for their on line service my advice is to AVOID this completely ...

I am not happy with the Aloe Vera toilet rolls as they don't have the lovely perfume of Aloe Vera as they used to have a few months ago. I loved the perfume- it filled my bathroom. So please bring back the perfume - in fact is there any Aloe Vera in them at all? If not then they shouldn't be advertised as such. One other thing I have noticed is that some items don't state where the product comes from - only that its supplied for Aldi stores. I thought stores always had to state at least which country it originated from.,0,3

I could not bear to bring myself to even eat it, as all I could think about was the smell, needless to say, it went straight into the recycle food bin, lesson learnt! Since that point, I have been or will be very weary of salad product(s) from here, if this was or is anything to go by, perhaps I was just unlucky as have had Rocket from there before with NO issues, but I cannot get past the smell, I guess the age old saying of, you pays your money, you takes your chance.",0,1

So, as well as trying to keep my daughter entertained, I realised when I got to the till with a trolley full of stuff... I had forgot my purse. Absolute nightmare. Luckily, their was this fantastic staff member on the till and she went out of her way to help me separate by shopping into frozen and chilled so she could store them while I went home to fetch my purse. I was so worried about what they would say (or make me feel) or make me do my shopping all over again when I came back, but they didn’t. I was absolutely blown away by the service I received. I wish I had the ladies name because she was absolutely fantastic.I can honestly say I wouldn’t of got that at Tesco without being made to feel like an inconvenience to them.",0,5

Aldi UK,Give your money to companies that deserve it,"Aldi's products are OKAY - they're not award winning (despite what they'd have you believe) but for me, it is convenient and I have shopped there regularly for a few years.I visited the Manchester Arndale branch of Aldi on lunch, collecting a few treats for staff in my office and proceeding to an empty conveyor belt. The cashier did not pay attention when scanning products and added them to the customer's basket in front (despite them very clearly being mine). When I said they were mine, he rudely and syllabically emphasised 'that's what the dividers are for', as though I were deaf or had a very basic command of English. Taken aback by his tone and attitude, I replied I had two lots of shopping to pay for separately and, considering the belt was empty, had only used one divider. He proceeded to repeat his comment with the utmost condescension. Ignoring my apology - his head was deliberately turned away as I spoke - he called someone to rectify the error on the till. When the customer in front tried to pay, the cashier politely advised him that it was not his fault, and was in fact 'this guy's fault', nodding to me. To salt the wound, he neither said please nor thanks when it came to my turn, and snatched my money as I paid. As I packed up, he threw the next customer's shopping into my slot, despite another slot being available (my understanding is that two slots are available to avoid this). Having written to Aldi, I received a generic response that my five-year-old could have drafted to a higher standard. I responded again, advising that I have spent thousands of pounds in Aldi and to be humiliated so publically deserved something a little more than a generic letter considering my loyalty to the brand (not compensation necessarily though it wouldn't go amiss, but even a letter written by a human being with empathy would have gone a long way - after all, isn't that the basis on which a complaints department hires its staff?). The final response I received was that they regrettably cannot afford to provide something complimentary but they take the incident seriously. Whether it was thinly veiled bigotry or not, nobody deserves to be treated like this. Regardless, bottom line is Aldi honestly could not give a s***.The majority of people work hard for their money, and as a result should spend it somewhere they receive good service and good products, and - the clincher - where companies appreciate it; Tesco, for example, who replaced three freshly baked goods free of charge after I accidentally held the bag upside down and dropped them at the till, the cashier insisting it was her fault for not tying the bag properly. That's service.Don't waste your money with Aldi - they don't deserve or appreciate your custom at all.",0,1

Spoke to their customer services department who told me that a bottle had been broken whilst being delivered and they were unable to send a replacement as it had since become out of stock. They had refunded only 11 bottles as only 11 bottles had been scanned back in as returned to depot given the breakage. The customer services assistant was not particularly apologetic and could not explain how or why it had happened - clearly if Aldi cancel an order there should be an automatic full refund and notice that the order has been cancelled!

Aldi UK,Dissappointed,"Bought a bottle of Whiskey from Aldi at £17.49. The bottles are not kept on the shelves, just a tube box which is filled at the till after you have paid, to stop shop lifting I presume. Be warned. When placed in the container the top is not secured as you would expect, as it would be at any other store. When I arrived home it was dark and unfortunately as I stepped out of my car I didn't notice that I was holding the tube upside down. The flimsy, ill fitting lid on it is not sufficient to bear the weight of the bottle.Aldi will not accept any responsibility for the inadequacy of the packaging, despite the fact that sometimes manufacturers will overdo it to the extreme on some products, especially on toys and electronics. They could at least sellotape the top at the checkout.Disappointed in Aldi that they have not taken my complaint seriously and say it is all my fault. I agree to a certain extent but ........ they have security tags on expensive steak. Why don't they put one on the whiskey and have properly packaged and complete tubes on the shelves? Or just sell the bottle without it, if it is just for show and not to keep it safe.I do virtually all of my food shopping in Aldi and have shopped at my local since it opened at least fifteen years ago. So they have had thousands of pounds in custom from me every year. The least they could do is take some heed and not just say I am the only person they know this has happened to.",0,1

Aldi UK,I've used a number of different stores …,"I've used a number of different stores and most seem to be afflicted by same issues:Fruit n veg goes off much too fast, sometimes within 24hrsBread appears to become stale quickly.However, their biggest issue is the staff. If they're not almost mowing you down with a full pallet of stock, they're being surly and uninterested in any reasonable questions you pose ( like where's the thing you've sold for years, which has disappeared without a trace) They appear irritated that you've had the audacity to interrupt their shouted, personal, conversations with a colleague ( who's usually at least 20 feet away)Then there's the tills....bit like a rude, dry version, of total wipeout. When you've finally gotten to within 20 feet of the helpful sign, promising more tills will be opened in response to your plight, the fun starts. If you're lucky the cashier hasn't thrown a ' till closed' bar at the customer in front of you. You then place your three items onto the belt, behind someone who's just placed 300, before you search for somewhere to put your basket. It's an anxious moment because, a second too slow, and the basket gatekeeper screeches that your committing the heinous crime of expecting to use it as protection from impending grocery artillery, launched by the cashier as they scan your goods. If you have the cheek to request they reduce the speed at which they're chucking stuff at you to 50mph, you get the icy death -stare, accompanied by ' we're a budget supermarket!' .....and your point is????? Of course this is assuming they've interrupted a loud conversation about a past/upcoming social event with a colleague to acknowledge your existence.Finally, just to complete the aldi experience, you have to negotiate the arbitrary security system....you've never stolen a thing in your life but you're left a nervous wreck, waiting for the alarm to randomly highlight you as a thief when you exit with your hard earned groceries, knowing that even a few minutes delay means your fruit will have gone mouldy by the time you reach the car. Once activated (every third visit) you wait in vain for someone to check your bags, to validate you as an honest person to onlookers, whilst a real thief, smelling like they haven't heard how cheap cien soap is, ambles by, unchallenged, with pockets full of cheap vodka.Well done aldi, the fawlty towers of grocery shopping.

Aldi UK,The Aldi Experience,"Who Shops There? Foreigners living in the UK, and middle-class women who love a spot of competitive frugality and think it’s a jolly wheeze to go there, so they can brag about it at Pilates.The Aldi Experience: Remember when you used to go on holiday to France or Spain as a child and visit the local supermarket, when you’d pick up a box covered in foreign writing and you weren’t sure whether it contained cornflakes or soap powder? Well now, thanks to Aldi, you can have that experience every day on the UK High Street.The food is stacked high and the staff are pretty thin on the ground. The store layouts seem to defy all logic. You’ll find the pasta nestling besides the goldfish food, and the digestive biscuits next to the pickles.The Good: Aldi shoppers rave about the meat and fish selections. Prices are as low as you can get, and nobody tries to flog you bags for life or hassles you about collecting school vouchers at the check-out. IF you’ve ever shopped in Aldi then you’ll probably have experienced its ultra-fast checkout staff. Aldi’s speedy reputation is no mistake, in fact, the supermarket claims that its tills are 40 per cent quicker than rivals.“I’m close to an anxiety attack every time I shop at Aldi due to the mad speed”. Some older customers are desperately trying to keep pace with staff quickly scanning purchases.The Bad: Chaotic, and there is something disconcerting about not having heard of any of the brand names. Del-Rivo orange juice anybody? How about Corale Baked Beans or Belmont Digestives?Typical Basket: A selection of cold meats, olives in a plastic vacuum pack, the world’s smelliest cheese, and catering-size jars of pickles with pictures of people in lederhosen on them.",0,4

Aldi UK,We decided to try Aldi last Tuesday …,"We decided to try Aldi last Tuesday (hall green, bham branch) for a change from Tesco. Although we did pay less for our shopping than we would normally have, the till service was just awful. The till assistant made no eye contact, let alone words and starting flying our items through as fast as he possibly could. It was impossible to keep up with him as we desperately tried to put our items back into our trolley. About halfway through, he was literally throwing the items at us as we tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to catch them. Every now and again, he would roughly yank the trolley towards him because it kept moving as the items landed in it. My partner told him repeatedly to calm down but it fell on deaf ears. I am disabled and shopping is difficult at the best of times. I would never have kept up with this mans pace if I had been without my partner and certainly couldn't have caught my items! Looking back, we can't help but see the funny side of this episode as it was like a sketch from Fawlty Towers, and we did wonder if it was a practical joke for a TV show. Sadly not.I have since emailed Aldi to complain and I have had no response and don't expect one now. I find that terrible. I wonder if being voted supermarket of the year has gone to their heads. Aldi, yes you are cheap, but you won't keep your 'award if you don't improve your 'customer service.' Oh well, back to Tesco for now.",0,2

Considering that the first person i spoke with was an assistant manager, his attitude and the manner he spoke to me in was embarrassing and definitely not managerial trained. I would not employ this person to work in any part of the store, i was shocked so much i made a formal complaint regarding this person. I was offered flowers as a good will gesture with an apology of another assistant manager. I declined the flowers its not about flowers its about the incident that should never ever have happened. Ive use this particular store since it opened but i will not be going back again. I was promised a call before 16.30pm that same day, it is now Tuesday and i have still not had a call from a manager.

Aldi UK,Management Retraining Needed-Purchase Receipts not needed for returns,"Management Retraining Needed: I had bought an Aldi branded 'nevadent' waterjet flosser. It did a good job and recommendable. However, it broke down, didn't pump water anymore. I took it back to my local Aldi in Leamington Spa, the manager was on a day-off and two assistant managers were in charge. I wanted my flosser replaced. Both assistant managers blanked my requests and were unhelpful being insistent that without a receipt, then replacement/refund would not be impossible. I explained that a receipt was not necessary as the consumer law allows for other proof (Google the topic for info) ie a bank statement; the original packaging (I showed this); a witness to the purchase (available). The managers were not interested in knowing and would only insist on the receipt for proof. This was disturbing; who keeps every receipt for the period of warranty (?) ...and they are not needed for returns. They need retraining.Eventually and frustrated, I contacted Customer Services at Aldi Head-office where the staffer was brilliant and solved the problem without fuss. I returned and received a replacement flosser quickly; and a great job was done. The local branch failed and customer services professionalism showed.Aldi: Please instruct your local managers on how to problem solve and retain loyal customers in a v.competative market place !",0,2

Complained again about this last visit and have been told again that they will tell the Manager! Well, if it works out like my last complaint, don't bother is my thought.There is another store a couple of miles away but this one too leaves much to be desired - generally scruffy and not a pleasant place to visit.Shall be trying LIDL from now on as I have made enquiries of their customers and been told how clean and welcoming their stores appear.Sorry, Aldi, you really do need to do something about your Store managers - they do not appear to have been trained in Retail Management",0,1

Aldi UK,From the perspective of a foreigner...,"Honestly, I have to say that I was only at ONE ALDI in the UK... Twice times in Upminster, Essex. I was very excited to visit ALDI in England because it's an origin German company which spread into the world.First impression: It's ALDI ""South""... I recognised it in this way because I'm a customer of ALDI ""North"" in Germany and this both are slightly different. The staff was absolutely friendly in the way I expected. The salesroom was tidy, clean and very okay. In difference to the German ""closed offering"" of fresh baked goods, here it is offered openly in basket work which is very natural, I think. I like it, but most German people would surely say that's unhygienic...I was impressed by the variety of fresh mushrooms... that are actually stored in a fridge! ...like other fresh vegetables too! In Germany, you only can dream of those presentations of fresh veggies and fruits at ALDI...When I asked a staff member for something like ""Salat-Fix"" which is a convenient powder combined with herbs, salt, dry vinegar and is simply mixed with water into a salad sauce, and he realised that I'm not really familiar with the English language, he was so nice... really absolutely nice! And again the same with another member of staff when I asked for ""Vanillezucker"" which is a mix with sugar and vanilla... real Bourbon-vanilla or probably only the aroma of vanilla. And I found quark in the cooler display, which isn't standard. Previously, I had talked about ""quark"" with my English friend and I got the impression, that it's unknown in England. I couldn't find it at LIDL and Waitrose.The current offers are nearly the same like in Germany. I didn't saw any offers of electronic devices, what is standard here.The customer can choose to take a little shopping basket instead of a big shopping trolley, depending on ones need. That's fine and also different to Germany.In both cases at the counter was a nice staff member who found friendly words to explain that I'm only allowed to buy two packs of painkillers, respectively said something about some sweets on the conveyor.I wished for more stores/several branches so that a denser network occurs and it becomes more simple for everybody to buy at ALDI.",0,5

I was at the checkout putting the food on the conveyer belt bearing in mind I had a box of nappies and bottles of lemonade under the trolley which is normal for me and before I got to the till the staff member asked me rudely to ""put the things under your trolley on the conveyer belt"" indicating I was trying to steal them and the look on her face was an angry one. Other members of the public heard her and I was so angry, embarrassed and upset by the way I had been spoken to I should have left all the food in my trolley and on the conveyer belt and walked out, but, I didn't!!..... I was with my two sons who was also accused of taking a drink without paying for it....!! but to her astonishment I told her my son was drinking red bull and they didn't sell it in store. WOW how dare she, who does she think she is!!!! I told her that I don't steal. I spend on average £180-230 per week. I have a good job and have worked for a fantastic bank for over ten years and therefore know a lot about customer service. If I had walked out the store without paying for the items then I could understand her attitude but this wasn't the case. I do believe that because I was in my casual clothes she took a firm dislike to me and my family. I would never treat any of my customers or staff in the way I have just been treated. in conclusion please avoid this store ......some of the staff think they are above you and their attitude stinks!!!!",0,1

Aldi UK,Rotten fruit and veg,Prices are generally good but it is a false economy. 3 times in 4 weeks I took back fruit and veg that was still in date. It was so off they were actually liquifying. I asked if there had been other complaints each week and they said none at all. Shame on you Aldi.,1,2
Aldi UK,"Great food, but rude staff..","I love the range of food from Aldi and find that their prices are good considering the cost of similar items from top supermarkets. Their food items are always fresh and taste amazing- some tasting better than named brands. The biggest downfall of the Aldi supermarkets are their new headsets. The members of staff have become very rude since wearing the headsets as they sit chatting to one another through them whilst serving customers. Many times I've been in the store and never had a 'hi, how are you' or anything. The staff members have been chattering away to their colleague on the headset and they only stop chatting to tell how much the shopping costs and that's it. I find it really quite rude, and it hasn't just been one individual staff member, it has been a few!",0,3
Aldi UK,Avoid at all costs,"My god! No clear bags for loose fruit and veg, went to a till to pay which had the till number lit red, I'm 5'4 so don't really see up that far, got chastised by cashier for queuing there and made out I was an idiot, he made the point a few times! Someone had spilt washing liquid all over the floor next to the till that I'd stood in and almost slipped up in (very dangerous at 35 weeks pregnant) told the boy on the till and he said oh and didn't even bother cleaning it up. Rang the items through at lightning pace practically throwing it at me. I then went to pay and handed him a healthy start voucher to cover the milk and the fruit and he obviously had no idea what it was and studied it and didn't know what to do so I'm £3:10 down as that wasn't accepted. Went to pay and his till had frozen and at this point I was beginning to think it was a joke. After 10 minutes a woman appeared and rung everything up again at a different till! Got home and half the shopping ive purchased is defective/mouldy/frozen pizza had a hair on. And I've also been charged £7 for something I only wanted a price check on and didn't buy in the end! I'll trust my instincts next time and go to Asda where my vouchers are accepted and there's not stuff all over the floor waiting to trip me up! Seems I'm not alone as everywhere people are saying what a poor show it is at Aldi.",0,1

I know 5p is not a lot of money but it is the principal of the thing. If Cashiers put a carrier bag on everyone's receipts regardless then this is not a good policy.

Aldi UK,A great store but not without its …,A great store but not without its problems. My local store recently had a revamp. Okay so far so good BUT why on earth did they split fruit and veg between two isles. To complete this part of our shopping we are now dodging between two isles to make sure we have got everything. Then when going through the store isle by isle in logical sequence we are retracing part of our route which has already been covered - so frustrating.The other issue is the blocking of isles with unnecessary palettes and empty boxes which are left right in the way denying access to many shelves and causing big congestion as customers try to get past - do they run courses in how to do this? Even where staff are filling shelves they seem quite oblivious and could surely organise the operation in a more customer friendly way.,0,3

Aldi UK,Aldi experience,"Worked at Aldi for 3 months. Be warned its horrible job. it Is heavily demanding with time limits on stacking products and heavy lifting is required A LOT, if you don't meet target times you will be insulted by the managers and threatened to loose your job if you don't work harder. When you are on the tills you are still expected to do pallets on shop floor, (Veg, Meat) if not they will not let you go home until you do, also you do not get paid for the extra 15/20 minutes you have to work extra, which is a normal day to day thing. I would notice managers ignoring me when I would call them and would show arrogance and be annoyed when I did need them. For example to give a customer a refund. Be warned it may look like an appealing job but your better off being a janitor. The work they expect is ridiculous, after training I was told by the manager I am working too slow, I explained I had just finished training but that wasn't good enough. Managers would have a laugh with each other but when I store assitant talks, even for a minute the manager would be on your case saying get back to it. Not to mention you only get 30 min break on a 10 hour shift. It may sound harsh but that's the reality for working for this sh!tty company.

I shopped at an aldi store,and left after 26 minutes without entering my vehicles reg number into the entrappment machine.Because I failed to supply my reg number did my presence somehow offend the manager,or did my presence somehow damage the carpark? I wonder if Mr Barnes will be brave enough to answer me.I must add that Aldi customer sevices kindly offered not to 'penalise'(they're own words)me if I would drive the 70+ miles(I live in rural Mid Wales and my nearest aldi is over 70 miles away in Bangor North Wales) back to the store to see the manager and some how prove I am a regular customer.They said this after I'd told them that it was first time that I had used one their stores.Aldi and parking eye need to be told that this is EXTORTION.Since receiving this 'fine' I have started to note how parkingeye position their signs(which are meant to inform the public that if they enter the carpark they entering into a contract with these cowboys),some are 15 TO 20 feet up a lamppost and above a 'WARNING' sign stating that the carpark shuts at 8.30pm.Most people would only see the lower sign as they drove past the lamppost.And,this contract is binding,unless you challenge it.But if you do challenge it you will come against their appeals process which is like playing cricket with the rules of rugby.The only contract that people expect to enter into when they go shopping is that they pay for the items before leaving the store,and that the items purchased are of good quality and value for money. But using a loophole in the law,..The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012(which was passed by Parliament in order to return to the British public,'freedoms' they feel other legislation has eroded or removed over time),Aldi and Parking Eye scamming millions of pounds from people.",0,1

Aldi UK,Inferior produce.,"We purchased two small bags of white potatoes at the LLantrisant Aldi store, in the middle of this week, marketed as one of their ""Super Six"" fresh offers priced at 29 pence. From the outside of the bag they looked to be very nice so we decided to buy some. However when we were preparing them for a family meal We realised that the purchase of two bags was a prudent move as the condition of the produce left much to be desired. Out of nine potatoes six were bruised and had grub evidence on the inside. Thank goodness for ""Smash"" powdered potato. It begs the question "" When is a bargain not a bargain ?"" as this was certainly not one. To be fair we have often had other vegetables from Aldi and found them to be satisfactory and I think Aldi's buyers need to look a little more closely at their products in order to satisfy customers. Aldi is classed as a discount supermarket but I do not think selling inferior produce should mean a drop in standards.I hope Aldi will take note of our complaint and be more vigilant in future.",0,2

Yes ive had a couple of dodgy products, but we try everything and see what suits - no it isnt tesco or sainsburys, but then you are not paying tesco prices !! Hats off to all at Ashton Under Lyne Aldi, great team of people doing a great job... keep it up. Mrs J Rigby, Ashton",0,5
Aldi UK,Poor customer service one of the …,"Poor customer service one of the employee at Yarm branch, not even apologizing that I can't use contact less card. You should teach and train them how to give customer service. Every customer is important if they upset one in a month, even lets say people go there because its cheap,well they won't come back anymore just because of your rude employee. You shouldn't advertise contact less if your machine is not working. Also apologize for inconvenient,not saying to the customer it's not my fault! very babyish reply!",0,1
Aldi UK,Don't bother,Don't bother. Hot tubs on line sold out immediately. So I was at the local store first this morning to find all in store had been pre sold before it opened. Went with the intention of buying hot tub and trying Aldi for my weekly shop but walked out without anything. Won't be changing my shopping habits! Off to Tesco to do my shop. I hate people wasting my time with offers they can't fulfil. This offer must have upset so many people as the store emptied when they found out.,0,1

I had bought them a few weeks before and had thrown the receipt away. The packaging got chucked away with the mouldy bread. They refused to issue a refund let alone anything as compensation for a rubbish product!",0,1
Aldi UK,Poor quality products,"Poor quality products. Many rude staff with very little customer service skills. What little you think you might save on your shopping beware .... from my experience many items particularly fruit & veg get thrown in bin because they're not fit for consumption. It's nothing but aggro to try & get a refund, it's hard enough actually getting thru till in first place to buy it. You then have to go elsewhere to buy your stuff again costing you more money. Very stressful shopping experience.",0,2
Aldi UK,Staff are so rude with a 'what ever' …,"Staff are so rude with a 'what ever' attitude, the shop might be cheap but manners cost nothing. They need to rethink their staff training. Will not shop again and will recommend my family and friends not do so also.",0,1
Aldi UK,getting better,"We go to Aldi now and again. PROS: It has a few things that Lidl lacks and vice versa (including a much higher score on the Ethical Consumer website). The store isn't all good value, but if you shop carefully you can manage your budget on a range of decent quality products. More quorn products and better frozen fish range (e.g. wild salmon and tuna) than Lidl. Better quality items from the chilled cabinet than Lidl too (e.g. exact same stonebaked pizza that is twice the price in leading supermarkets!).CONS: Very few organic or Fairtrade products. No German bread (unlike Lidl). The [old] store environment is really grim and depressing [the newer stores have wider aisles and improved lighting]. The older stores aren't quite the black hole of Calcutta, but maybe a modern, fluorescent lit take on it.",0,4
Aldi UK,Rotten food.,"On the 20th of March, 2017 I bought, cooked ham, a bag of washed salad and a chilled garlic bread stick. The garlic bread had visible mould growing on it, the ham stank awful, and the underneath slices where grey. The bag of salad tasted old as if it's been left in the fridge for ages.. All the above foods had long dates printed on them.. I was more than angry, my son has a reduced amune system, this food if given could have made him extremely ill. I will not be shopping at aidi again.. I have also mentioned to my friends and family about my experience and they have now stopped shopping at aldi..I now shop at Morrions or Tesco. The price maybe more but the quality is far better. At least the food is edible. You can not put a price on your health.😥",0,1
Aldi UK,"Good customer service, great shop","Having recently dealt with both Aldi and Lidl customer service, it was like night and day, Aldi actually replied back pretty quickly, they dealt with the situation well, but the advice from both of them is basically deal with the store direct and don`t bother us",0,4
Aldi UK,Good Products But Shockingly Lousy Customer Service,"I shop in Aldi most weeks, because they have good products at a fair price. As time has gone by, I am finding that they have more and more of the products I am looking for so I am having to shop less elsewhere. However, and this is a huge however, what I absolutely HATE is the way that products are thrown at you at the till when you check out. It seems that they are taught that the quicker they can scan the products through the better. I might be spending £40-50 in a shop but this doesn't matter - it is still put through at greater than light speed with little chance of my putting them in any semblance of order in my bags. I arrive home with food squashed and in disarray. Is it really necessary to make customers feel that your money is wanted but you are not? Furthermore, woe betide that you get in the way of an ALDI employee stocking shelves because you will be in their way, and this is just not allowed. The ALDI motto should be WE WANT YOUR MONEY BUT GET YOU AND YOUR PURCHASES OUT OF OUR STORE NOW!!! It might be a saving coming to an ALDI store, but you know what, it is getting to the point where I say forget it and go elsewhere.",0,2

Aldi UK,Great Value at Aldi,"I love finding great places to buy from, and Aldi is my latest find. I was at first put off by shopping there, as I had heard that it was all german food.

Aldi UK,Loose fruit bags,"Just left the Annan branch, not for the first time there were no bags for loose fruit. I asked a member of staff for bags and was told they didn't have any.

Aldi UK,What has happened to the spuds?,"Several weeks ago I bought a bag of Maris Piper potaoes to make mash with. When peeling, I noticed that many were a greyish colour, and they seemed to fall apart when cooking. When I attempted to mash them, they turned to the consistency of glue and were inedible. A few days later I mentioned this to my daughter who also shops at Aldi and she said she had experienced exactly the same. A few people at work have also said the potatoes from Aldi had recently gone totally downhill. I left it a couple of weeks, then bought some more, but sadly they were just as bad. When I mentioned this to a member of staff I was told I should buy them elsewhere if this had happened more than once!!! Don't worry, Aldi, I will !!!",0,1

Aldi UK,King prawn bhuna,Recently made 2 purchases from the specially range 1 the King prawn bhuna and 1 lamb rogan josh. Was surprised at the difference between the two dishes I cannot fault the lamb rogan josh ....delicious thick chunks of lamb in a thick and tasty sauce.......however the king prawn was less favourable......NO WAY KING prawns they were extremely small and I've never had to CHEW Prawns before!!! The sauce although tasty was so runny I had to eat with a spoon. Won't be purchasing the King Prawn bhuna again I'm afraid ....... very disappointing.,0,2
Aldi UK,Aldi & Reputations,"Aldi store is fairly inexpensive!. It is purposeful and some of the products are good value, but, a store like this gets so crowded sometimes, that you cannot move, I can never find everything that I need and the staff in one particular store was just down right rudeGone are the days when ( The Customer Is Always Right )",0,1
Aldi UK,Infestation!!,I bought a box of muesli cereal from Aldi in Enfield London. It was from their specially selected range. A few weeks later my children noticed worms crawling on the kitchen ceiling and walls. We opened the cupboard and there were worms coming out of the box and some of them had started to form webs around themselves. We did a Google search and found that they were pantry moth larvae. My kids were screaming and if im honest it really really freaked me out as well. What im angry about is that my children had eaten from that box. I had to literally bin everything in all of my cupboards and wash down absolutely every inch of my kitchen with vinegar and insecticide. A great way to spend my night and early morning! I contacted Aldi in the morning and they wanted me to reopen the rubbish to find the bag I had triple tied and placed in my wheelie bin to provide evidence. No way was I reopening all those black sacks to find the one box! I knew by this time the sack would be infested with worms. No way was i letting them out!!! I had to bin all my food even the tinned food as pantry moth eggs can hide anywhere. The only safe food was the frozen food. Pantry moths once they cocoon and hatch are nearly impossible to get rid.of. it's been over 3 months and we have not seen any moths or larvae. When you buy dry goods from Aldi be very careful!!! I'm back to shopping at Sainsbury's and Tesco. Will not buy food at Aldi for love or money!!! My families health and well being comes first!!,0,1
Aldi UK,New Aldi scam,"I shopped at Aldi today and usually I dont check my my bill . But today I checked my bill and found they have overcharged £1.25p. I think it's a scam if it would happen to 100 customers Aldi would be making £125.00 pounds easily a day. I have buying my Aldi for years and how much would have I lost???. This is totally unacceptable, when called tried to speak to a manager, the manager didn't want to even hear what I wanted to say, it's very unfair is this how Aldi customers being dealt with????",0,1
Aldi UK,Bullied by staff to buy more food to get a parking ticket validated,"Visited there store on anncoats manchester and was told I hadn't brought enough shopping to get my parking ticket validated!! Asked to see the manager who told me I hadn't got enough items for an hours shop and to validate the ticket. However, there was absolutely no way I was been bullied into buying more items! I asked the store manager that I want a where if the new rule and could he let me off on this occasion - but no! Boll***** to the store manager at anncoats. I'd rather have a fine than be forced into buying food I don't want. Disgraceful to think a brand like Aldi is forcing people to buy more food in that way",0,1
Aldi UK,"Food rotten and smelling before Use By date, told to return to store!","I bought 2 packs of belly pork slices on 11th February 2017. I realised that the item was rotten from the appalling smell upon cooking it. This shouldn't have happened as the Use By date was 6 days later. I had to throw the meat and even the tin that it was cooked in into the bin due to the smell and my entire house stank!I contacted Aldi customer services via email and was told that they thought that their supplier had been leaving meat out of the chillers for too long and that they would keep an eye on them! They said I could return the packaging for a replacement! I informed that I couldnt return the packaging as I had to dispose of it due to the vile smell. The incident had turned me off shopping at Aldi altogether so the last thing I wanted was an exchange! It has actually turned me off eating meat too!I got so fed up of the ridiculous responses from Aldi customer services that I complained via Resolver and I was eventually offered a £5.00 voucher... the pork had cost me £6 so the offer was a joke. This is not the first time that I have purchased rotten food from Aldi and I am really concerned that meat is being sold in this condition due to pork being such a dangerous meat if strict practices arent followed. It is lucky that the meat smelt so bad that we noticed there was a problem. I wont be shopping at Aldi again and if you want fresh, edible food I would suggest shopping elsewhere.",0,1
Aldi UK,Double payment,"On checking the till receipt found again that one item had been entered twice. Not a lot of money, 45p, but annoying. And no, I don't have the time to go back and argue the toss with the store manager - how do I prove this anyway? The store was at Comet Square, Hatfield Herts.Incidentally, found it impossible to use Tellaldi.com - no simple email possible.",0,3
Aldi UK,"Yes, QUALITY QUESTIONABLE !","Yes, I agreed Aldi WAS the place to go for great value, quality and choice although somewhat limited did offer a great place to shop for 85% of your needs, Plus - the amazing offers of beauty treatments, clothes kitchenwares, electrical etc, Now their once tasty biscuits have shrunk ! Their quality has to be examined closely. I bought my first pie- called a ""Salmon& Watercress Puff Pastry Pie"" WRONG it was a Pastry Watercress & Salmon Pie"" in that order ! ONLY 12% salmon which I do normally check the pack, we didn't - the picture enticing, yes the contents poor.Loads of Watercress sauce tiny salmon content supposedly for 4 persons = 6 x 1"" cubes of salmon ONLY!

Aldi UK,Unreliable delivery. Lacks communication. Poor packaging.,"The ALDI website is easy to navigate, it offers pretty good information about their products. Signing up process is easy and straight forward.This was my first ever order with ALDI. I made the order on Friday and opted for a Saturday delivery. However, nothing was delivered on Saturday. There was no communication regarding this delivery issue.I rang up customer service. The staff was friendly and refunded the money for delivery cost. However, ALDI could not expalin why there was no communication nor no Saturday delivery.Update: 16 Feb 2017I received the delivery on the 13th Feb. There was no consistency in packaging. I received 2boxes of wine. One had wine bottle air bag, the other had not. The result, one broken bottle in the box without wine bottle air bag cause of the broken handle of the box. On 16th Feb, I rang up customer service about the broken wine bottle. They listened to my complaint and kindly redunded the cost of thr broken wine bottle as a gesture of goodwill. Warning: I really don't recommend ordering 6+ bottles of wine from ALDI. The ALDI wine is being delivered by Yodel. The box ALDI uses for wine delivery is not really strong. The handle can be broken easily due to the weight of 6 bottle of wines. Since there is a chance without wine bottle air bag, the wine bottle can be broken easily.",0,3
Aldi UK,Rubbish customer service,"I bought a sandwich maker in November 2016 for Christmas. I used it once and it worked, but when I used it again it stopped. It says on the box which I still have that this is specially made for Aldi. I took it back to the store and expected a full refund as it was within 6 months and was obviously faulty. My daughter had also bought one and it never worked at all. The store manager told me they could not refund without a receipt even for a faulty item. I realise this is the case if I just change my mind, but not if something is faulty. You would think that Aldi would be happy to make a refund for faulty goods to create a good impression, but they seem not to care what their customers think of them. I will never buy electrical goods at Aldi again. They may be cheap but they are rubbish and you don't get a refund when they go wrong.",0,1
Aldi UK,You can only feel sorry for the staff,The staff look beaten up- and do not expect them to stop and help if you indicate you need help. I had an awful experience of coming back and mistakenly demanding a cash back which i believed the till operator had overlooked. The man gave me what i demanded when i proved from my wallet that I did not have it.A short while later i discovered that I was in fact already given the cash back. I rang through to tell the manager- and came right over. It was then i learned that the till operator who gave me two cash backs had been fired from his job.This is the one of the many scary discoveries you might find...i've since learnt from other people in the community other stories that come from the store how they treat staff... remember that under those specials lies a German model which intimidates staff and destroys lives,0,1
Aldi UK,Poor customer service,"I have generally been impressed with Aldi in terms of offering value at low prices, however I have today had reason to complain and have been really disappointed with the response. Yesterday, I bought a chicken to cook today for Sunday lunch. The use by date was 6 days hence. I roasted it today and it was rotten and smelt disgusting. Not the end of the world I accept, however I had planned a Sunday lunch and now had nothing to serve and had to waste my valuable family time taking my 3 young children shopping and then cook another meal. Although I have been offered a refund for the chicken, the tone of the email was pretty much ""yeahs that happens. Take the packaging and the receipt and we'll give your money back"". In all honesty, I would have expected more than that. Obviously a refund is necessary by law as it was unfit for purpose, but perhaps some acknowledgment that their mistake had negatively impacted on my day and perhaps an apology would be nice. I don't feel that they care or value my custom.",0,2
Aldi UK,Good value for money,"I feel that Aldi provides better value for money than other supermarkets. I would normally go to tesco but it's awful value for money so started going to Aldi. The washing powder is great and so cheap half to a third of the price of fairy powder or Ariel in tesco. Toiletries are decent and cheap, food is what you would expect for the price the less money you pay the not so great the product although there are some exceptions. Although even the higher priced goods are still very cheap. I would however say that some products eg - fruit and veg, bread don't have very good shelf life left when bought. And always be prepared for your shopping to zoom through the till as it's pack it yourself at the side like lidl. I just get bags ready open in my trolly to put the items straight in. Parking can be a hassle and I really don't agree with the time limit especially if they want people to stay in there shop and spend more money. However overall I'll continue to go to Aldi. I can spend the same in Aldi as I do in tesco but get double the amount of items even some luxuries.",0,4
Aldi UK,Never had issues,"Never had any problems at Aldi in Perth. The cashiers are generally very friendly and, if you have loads in your trolley, they will help you unpack. Good selection of items. Would like more organic but I guess we can't have everything!",0,5
Aldi UK,Sadly they use Parcel Force - disaster,"First ever purchase from Aldi and sadly it's been nothing but a failure and an inconvenience.I ordered online and choose a 'selected day' delivery, for which I paid extra. I live alone and between the commute and work I'm out for very long hours, so to be home for a delivery on any day takes planning and is an inconvenience. Imagine my joy then when, having been at home all day and regularly checking the delivery tracker (telling me my parcels were 'out for delivery), 6pm arrives and suddenly the system tells me there's been a 'failed attempt' to deliver. Erm, no there hasn't. I was home. No knock. No call to the number I provided. No reaosnable attempt to deliver. A day of productive work lost.I've told Aldi to cancel the order, as I'm not willing to be inconvenienced again. Sadly - this is Aldi's issue to deal with as they choose to use such an inept delivery company.",0,1
Aldi UK,Thief!,I shop here regularly and all the staff have seen me here. I am a good spender. Why do the staff members especially the management have to watch me especially at the till through checkout. They speak through the earpiece and get cashiers to check my trolley so much so that I lift my bags so they know I can hear them. I have never in my life shoplifted but am made to feel like a thief. This branch in Accrington has only white staff and by the looks of them and treatment I always receive detect that they do not like foreigners. Very rude and even brusque when requesting help. I only go there for the top range products which are generally good but if this continues I shall go to Lidyl where I receive service with a smile and not service with a snarl. I am technically paying their wages so they should be nice.,0,1
Aldi UK,Good Online Service and Good Customer Service,"I recently bought a few items from Aldi online. Delivery was free, with no minimum spend, and the items arrived the very next day. Four, rather than 5 stars because some items can only be purchased in store.I also recently tried to buy a specific kettle and visited 3 different local Aldi stores but none of them had the item (though it was advertised in one of their brochures as already being available in-store) and none could not say when new stock could be expected. A couple of days later I rang the customer services central helpline just to get put through to one of my local stores (they don't give out the phone numbers). The phone was answered almost straightaway and the young lady I spoke to took my postcode then checked with all the local stores and found one that had just had their stock of kettles delivered that morning. I went out and managed to get one. Great customer service.",0,4

Aldi UK,Been shopping with aldi for years,"Generally great value for decent products, shop weekly in 2 local stores. I've found the freshness of their fresh fruit and veg to be more variable than at tesco, in particular the maris piper potatoes which have often been very brown. Fresh and processed meats that I've bought have always been excellent, as have dairy, tinned, jars and frozen. I've not experienced any problems with customer service in store, quite the opposite infact, staff happy to check if products in the back and fuss free returns including a very fatty gammon steak and an HD TV which just wasn't as great a picture as I was expecting. Only had cause to contact their customer service line twice, and could not fault them on either occasion as both issues resolved to my satisfaction. My wife got a parking charge notice for a 14 minute overstay in their carpark, which was cancelled when I contacted parking eye to challenge it and provided her aldi receipt, a straightforward process, so again can't complain.",0,4

Aldi UK,Specially Selected range,"We tried the Chicken & portobello mushroom pie. Nice looking, posh box with fancy gold lettering, but as they say the "" the proof of the pudding is in the eating"", well we both said, ""yuk"" never again. It had a strange aftertaste that could not be pinned down, almost like a strong cheesy flavour. We much prefered the superb,slightly cheaper family pies which for some strange reason we couldn't find. I have to add at this point , it has nothing to do with the ""cost"" It was purely down to flavour. It seems Aldi want to go 'up market' to compete with the likes of M&S. My suggestion is to stick with what you do best.We also tried the Specially Selected Raspberry fondant macaroons, awful, the strong chocolate flavour overwhelmed all the other ingredients, What's the point?Needless to say these products will be avoided in future. It could be said of course, this is just a case of personal preference but on comparing notes from others we seem to be in total agreement. Graham.",0,3

Aldi UK,Aldi going Down Hill,Looks to me like the big chiefs in Aldi have decided on Greed over Quality & Price.Over the past year I have seen all the Best Selling produce dissapear from Aldi's shelves.Mince meat has changed and is also smaller but a higher price.Most of the Cereals have shrunk in size but not price.Many of the Vegetables including the frozen veg have changed for the worst or dissapeared.There were around 10 particular items I used to buy every week which were so popular if you didn't get there early enough they would be gone by the end of the day. ALL of these products have Gone !Only a fool would stop selling products that are Best Sellers. Something very wrong is happening with Aldi.

Aldi UK,"Love It, Just Need More Choice In Spain!","I live in Nottingham UK and have shopped at ALDI for years and loved it but now we spend most of our time in Spain within a very large expat community in Playa Flamenca on the Orhuela Costa Costa Blanca South and it is so annoying that I can't even get the Red Label Tea bags or any of our favorite Yogurts etc. I do realise that this is Spain and in the town of Torrevieja where it is mostly Spanish I can understand this but in the Urbanization where there is a large Brit community a few more products that you sell in England would make sense. Please can you look into this. I know lots of people who feel the same, at the moment I don't go in there to shop very often now and that is a shame..",0,4
Aldi UK,Aldi/Maginon  CCTV Camera,"Ok 1 star, great product easy to use, did my homework yes itcan be hacked but it's not sold as a high security product and thats really not an Issue for me. The manufacturer is very helpful to.Where it goes wrong, Fitted first one fine, checked out the software to make sure I could add others, went back to store and they have no more, they dont know if or when they will be getting more!.... phoned customer services for Aldi....Same answer but told I could take the camera back! Which is now bolted with security fixings 20foot up the side of a building! The lady explained they are one of buys and they do that thing all the time....I explained its not quiet the same as I recently brought a Yale alarm and extra switches are available! Suggest Whomever the buyer was that brought this product into the UK put no thought whatsoever into after sales and what the product was. Stupid Stupid Stupid! now have to either get another system and stop subscribing to downloading to the cloud for this system, or go to france of Belgium where it is readily available",0,1

Aldi UK,Anorexic Turkey,"I purchased a,Turkey from Aldi in Eastbourne and cooked it as we have done for the past 20 years. Cut a long story short, started to carve it and hit bone straight away. The meat that came off a large turkey did not even fill a breakfast bowl.I then complained to customer service and sent 6 pictures. I was then told to take a photo of the packaging....I am sure everyone keeps the packaging, not sure if Aldi have heard of salmonella!! I did not keep the receipt as this was purchased on the 29th Nov. Basically i provided them with the date I purchased this and if I wanted a refund I would have to take my statement into the store....not being funny but why do I need to do all the work to obtain a refund when they are selling dodgy goods. They basically were not helpful and it appeared that they could not be bothered. I really feel they need to brush up on their customer service skills as they are quick to take the money, but not quick to rectify a complaint when they are selling unedible goods.This was obviously pumped so full of water which is a damp right cheek.Well done Aldi you certainly know how to run your customer service department........not.",0,1

Aldi UK,Very poor service,Was spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner by checkout staff as I placed my shopping basket on the moving belt. A few things to remember Aldi; if you treat your staff like scheisse they will return the favour. If you model your business on cold profit driven efficiency you will drive shoppers elsewhere. Change the way you train your staff by rewarding good customer experience rather than playing a numbers game. Put some more tills or self serve areas in the store because waiting in a queue for what seems like a lifetime only to be hurried along in an abrupt manner when you eventually reach the checkout is really annoying. To summerise shopping at Aldi is not a great experience. The products are generally good but the customer service (or lack of It) is appalling.,0,1
Aldi UK,TRACY,I recently did my shop at the new aldi that has opened and i always struggled with the checkout.....however this particular day the lady at the checkout was amazing. Tracy did not go a hundred miles per hour crushing my cakes and bicuits. Her pace was steady and worked with me. Thankyou tracy for such a pleasent end to my shop. Would be great if all the checkout staff were as considerate.One again thankyou Tracy:),0,5

Aldi UK,Small light up Christmas trees,I bought two of these which came with batteries. I put the two of them on when I got home and was very pleased with them. The next day they both stopped working so I replaced the batteries and they were fine again. After a couple of days they packed up again so I bought both Duracell and Panasonic batteries and the trees worked again. This morning they have both stopped again. I have now gone through 18 batteries and have now come to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the trees. Has anyone else had a problem with theses?,0,1

Aldi UK,Advent calendar,I was very excited to buy Aldi's advent calendar this year and to give me an opportunity to try out their beauty products. I bought it as soon as it was in the shop because 'limited stock only' I paid out £19.99. To see then over the following weeks it reduced to £9.99 and then £4.99!! I could not be more disappointed by each window I open to the point I don't think I will bother anymore and certainly will not be buying one again. I love Aldi but you've let me down this time!!,0,2
Aldi UK,Warranty/ customer service,"Phoned Aldi for a spare filter for ash vac was told item is over a year old implying it was out of warranty, I explained I wanted to buy a filter she said Aldi do not stock ANY spares but if I cut the plug off it take a picture and send it to them with receipt I might get half my money back.

Aldi UK,Utterly diabolical experience in an Aldi store!,"I visited an Aldi on the way home and I didn't even know which one it was as it was dark, though it wasn't my local. It was a calm day there. I went up to this employee but he didnt have a name tag on. I kindly asked him for an item and he shrugged as he said 'I can't right now' then walked off to the checkouts, which he was expremely rude. Annoyingly enough, he was the only one serving at the checkouts and it wasn't busy at all. I got to the tills and I said 'Hi', and he muffled a 'uhm'. I let that pass. I hadn't finished putting my items on the belt and he literally slammed the items down and a few fell through the gaps of the till, then a pack of pop bottles smashed on the floor wetting the buscuit display by the till. (Another customer looked over the display from the other side and said 'woah'.) This time, I said 'Could you please relax a little?' he then replied with 'I'm sat down, and compfy so yeah, I'm relaxed.' I kind of though he was joking, but quickly realised he actually wasn't. (The same customer made a loud 'huff' in shock of what he said.) I then said 'Could somebody fetch another one please?' He just looked at me and said 'I'm serving you so its best if you get it your self'. (The same customer went to my side of the display and stopped to look and I knew he was going to say something sooner or later.) I replied with 'Ohh great, what about this spillage though?' He replied with 'As you could probably tell, I'm the only one on the floor at this minute.' I then replied with 'What about it being a slipping hazard for other customers?' He then gave me a few paper towels and a wet floor sign from behind the till. I immediately reacted 'I'm not cleaning it all up.' He then sarcastically replied 'For the display and your hands.' I said 'Ummm, OK.' (The customer then said 'You can't act like this with customers.) I was obviously an inconvinence because of this and the customer's involvement. He also didn't care when it came to the eggs; he scanned them and literally thrown them to the end. After he'd finished burning a hole in this whole experience, he said quite fast 'Cash or card.' I didn't understand at first what he said so, screaming on the inside, I kindly asked 'Sorry, what did you say?', he huffed and repeated 'Cash or card.', whilst pointing at the till and pin pad. I said reluctantly 'Card'. Once I had payed, he then pushed the trolley from the end without me taking my card and wallet so I pushed the cart back gently to reach my things. (The customer was also agrevated and said a few words 'At least wait for him to fetch his things you ignorant b*****d.) The cashier just chuckled at him and gave me a forced grunt as I walked off. I didn't report it as there was no one to talk to, so I'm guessing he was the person in charge. The customer also followed me out the door whilst slamming his basket on the floor.I haven't a clue which Aldi it was and I'm not really bothered about him or the store as it wasn't my local. I just though to share this experience.Thank you.",0,1
Aldi UK,nice people,"If I get good customer service in a place then I will go back. Paisley is fantastic.Aldi has its issues, particularly at the chrckouts, but they seem to be happy and helpful. I like it",0,5
Aldi UK,Amazing food amazing prices stressful checkout,Can do a full shop on just £20 and it's really good quality most of the time. Everyone seems to give it a bad time on here but I can't see why. Maybe because they can't handle packing all the bargains at the end of the shop because it can be stressful with the speed at which they throw your groceries at you. 4/5 in general. Nice job guys,0,5
Aldi UK,Size reductions,"I have been shopping at Aldi from the beginning and therefore have grown into the till procedures, that so many people complain about and I must admit I have always tolerated them because of the cheap prices and quality of their product. However, in the last few months I have begun to rethink my loyalty.Over the years I have noticed the gradual reduction in the size of biscuit packs but have never been able to verify this, as I have not had an old pack to confirm my suspicions. Last week I bought my usual supply of 'Harvest Morn' Luxury Fruit Muesli only to discover that the packaging had changed, as had the size of it to 750g.Drat, I was in the same predicament of not having the evidence. Imagine my elation (sad I know), when shopping this week in my local Aldi, some old stock had been put out with the new boxes. These boxes were 1Kg as opposed to the new ones, which are 750g, but at the same price.A 250g difference is massive; it is now a quarter smaller than what it was previously. This is clearly representative across many of their lines and if this continues, people will no longer put up with shoddy till experiences and will vote with their feet. Just remember that the Travelodge brand lost out to Premier Inns owing to a similar complacence.",0,3
Aldi UK,Not just one store ! Staff training needed,"We have shopped frequently at a couple of Aldi stores in the Wakefield district of West Yorkshire (Durkar & Alverthorpe).It is highly unlikely that we will revisit either of them due to the obvious lack of cutomer care at the checkouts. We understand that checkout operators have a set time in which to scan items & as such the small area you have to put your goods away from (your trolley) soon gets full. However after todays debacle at the checkouts we object to having our goods that we are purchasing thrown through the checkout. The operator failed miserably in respect of being customer friendly. We asked for our loaf of bread to be replaced as they had grabbed, scanned & thrown the loaf, to the effect of it being squashed/sqeezed in the middle. Good old efficiency getting the goods though, alienating your customers & spoling your own goods & profits doesn't help anyone. The thing is - civility, care, manners & the right attitude cost nothing to the individual - but if they're lacking at the front of any business - it will cost in lost revenue. Simply people will go elsewhere. No apology was offered. An order given to a store operative on their bluetooth earpiece while sticking a finger in their opposite ear resulted in the damaged loaf being replaced.Between both stores we feel so agrieved that we're of the opinion that Aldi has become an organisation where the customer is always wrong -",0,1
Aldi UK,Pathetic delivery company for online orders,"I ordered something online through Aldi, who used Yodel. On Wednesday morning I received a message saying delivery would be between 7pm and 9pm. I cancelled my gym class and waited in. The tracking details said there were loads of deliveries before mine and it didn't update, they never turned up. I did a live chat and was promised an early delivery next day. Nothing happened, no message and no delivery. In the evening I did another live chat and was advised my package hadn't even been scheduled for redelivery, but again I was promised an urgent redelivery today Friday. This morning I got another message promising delivery 7pm to 9 pm. So again waitedin, on a Africa you Night. At 9 pm there were still 37 ahead of me and 41 at 7pm. So didn't arrive, failed again and no idea when I'm going to get my package. I can't even arrange to reschedule or pick up as it's never been delivered. Total amateurish out",0,1

Aldi UK,What's happening to Aldi,"I shop in Aldi at Allenton Derby most days, being has it's local to me I tended to treat it like a corner shop, but the sad new is that since the Aldi got a refit the prices seem to sneaking up, like the milk has gone up twice in the past month or so, not to mention lots of other thing seem to have gone up, Now I understand thing do go up but they seem to be getting like all the other supper markets, Also something I came across the other day there Salted pistachio nut 150g are £1.29 or if you want to get a bigger bag you can get 300g bag for well over £3+ , Sorry can't remember exact price but it's 60p>70p more just to get double the amount in one bag.Now I can't complain about the till I always past through fairly quick.Come on Aldi don't get like the other supper markets",0,3
Aldi UK,Warranty / Customer Service,"Store staff really need training on Aldi's warranty and how it works, if you are not going to have a normal system where the customer goes back to the store and they deal with it, the least you could do is train staff to understand the system and to be less condescending to customers.OK an update, phoned the customer service number as advised who gave me a reference number to take back to the store for a refund??? Surely this could have all been dealt with the 1 visit to the store?",0,1
Aldi UK,Rude customer service,"Aldi at Taylor avenue in Parkville Maryland. Staff don't know prices, are always rude. They ring up wrong prices and then act like it is a chore to give you your money back.

Aldi UK,Rude staff member and poor quality products.,"Bought a pack of Clancy's Jumbo Dry Roast peanuts yesterday and the size of the nuts was no bigger than normal. Certainly NOT Jumbo, more like Chihuahua size. Tried to get to the Savoy cabbages and after pushing an abandoned product cage out of the way changed my mind on seeing how small they were at a price higher than the nearest major supermarket, Morrisons. On reaching the checkouts, there were only two open, so we joined the one with the shortest queueonly to be ""barked"" by a woman I presume was in charge, to go to the other till which had a full load of shopping on the belt. We joined the other queue and were soon informed That the other till was re-opening and people behind us moved to that till leaving us to wait while the belt was unloaded. The woman in question never used the word please.After this experience, the clutter around the store, high prices and bad service we will not be using Aldi at Wath Upon Dearne anymore. We will be sticking to Morrisons and Lidl (the best of the discounters) where there is no clutter and the staff are polite.",0,1
Aldi UK,Shocking attitude to your customers at the tills,"Like so many other shoppers, I have reached the end of my tether with the appalling treatment we get at the tills. Shopping is flung past the till, there is always a row over which way the trolley has to be (I have a very bad back and cannot reach over the trolley to pack my shopping) and the pressure to get my shopping paid for and get out does not make me feel like a valued customer at all. The manager was serving the last time we shopped and he was so rude to us we will never return.Aldi in Ashington, Northumberland. Terrible.",0,1

Aldi UK,The food rush!,"I like the products at Aldi overall. You've guessed it, there's a big BUT coming!Every single time I've shopped with them, without fail it's a nightmare at the tills. Sometimes it's a lack of open tills, lack of staff. However today I actually saw them close a till in their Bramley store whilst people were waiting at others! And when you do eventually get served its a rush job, to the point where you feel under pressure! I tend to use a small basket so I pack as they scan, leaving the basket where you have to at the front. There's no offer of assistance and most of the time body language suggesting I should be quicker.This is simple stuff to get right and if they really want people to become regular core shoppers with them, they must improve this! It genuinely puts me off using the stores as much as I might if this wasn't an issue. Shame really.",0,3

The manager was called I was asked to step aside while cctv footage was checked. Ten minutes later checkout lady came and said till had to be checked another ten minutes later she came back and gave me my ten pound note and apologised alas no sign of manager to give a apology for the embarrassment on behalf of Aldi he is rude and abrupt on a normal day so is the way to treat a customer I think he needs re training in charm school module .",0,1

The delivery driver told me the other 2 were out of stock. 3 days later they had not been delivered & I had no texts or emails about them so I rang the Wine Club number. I was told that the other 2 cases had been damaged and deemed unfit to deliver so had been returned to the warehouse. She could not explain why I had had no messages about this. I wondered what would have happened if I hadn't rung them. was told I would receive a refund on the 2 cases in 14 working days. I had to ask for the £4 extra I had paid to also be refunded. This was later agreed. This has put me off using the Wine Club again.",0,2

Aldi UK,Makes me unwell at the thought.,"Horrible experience shopping in this place, its like a magnet for attracting arrogant pensioners who steal all the parent and child parking spots, who don't give a damn about parents trying to negotiate the death trap car parks.Then you get stuck behind the waddling dawdlers, usually morbidly overweight women in leggings looking at the gossip mags and reduced lard in the chiller aisles.The goods are not too bad, but if you can get past the obstacles, the pallet trucks and food trolleys and get the Hell out as soon as possible it reduces the stress.The staff are disenchanted, rude and arrogant but if you want store assistance that is high go to America, throw them a tip and it should improve matters. The staff in Aldi are not there to socialise after all.If you do trip over a pallet truck which frequently block the aisles with no warning signs, you can expect a huge payout from the HS&E prosecution taking into account the size of the business.Many quality establishments fine unauthorised motorists who park in disabled or parent and child spots, so Aldi take note, there is money to be made here by those that abuse the system.",0,1

Aldi UK,Would give the experience a minus but will not allow me.,"The Redcar shop. Based in the run down part of Redcar that attracts very undesirable customers.Recent visit..Lady in her 60s blocked the main entrance to the shop, my teminaly ill father, why he wants to shop in this 'lower than bargain bucket shop' beats me, asked her politely to move so he could enter, she ignored him, i politely asked her again if she would get off her mobile phone and allow us to enter the shop, the lady still refused to move explaining that her phone call was very important, i insisted that she moved upon where i was met with a barrage of abuse from the woman which i vocally returned. A shop assistant came over and asked the lady and myself to part, i moved away from the woman whom followed myself around the shop verbally abusing myself, my father paid for his single purchase and we tried to leave, whilst trying to leave the shop the same lady was waiting outside of the main entrance and again started verbally abusing myself and my father.Whilst Aldi can not be responsible for whom they let into their shops surly some sort of physical presence from some sort of security people would have not gone a miss.Upon arriving home my Father realised that one of his purchases was infact the incorrect item and asked me to take him back to exchange the item, Aldi did without hesitation, full marks Aldi for that. During the return visit the same lady again verbally abused myself and my Father and had enlisted the services of her son, a well built gent in his 30s, by the way he spoke to both myself and my Father he was under the influence of some sort of drugs, Aldi had 3 white shirted security gentlemen at this point whom did absolutely nothing to assist my Father or myself, the lady and her son continued the argument in the Aldi car park, again the Aldi security staff did nothing to assist.Not one member of my family will be shopping at Aldi again due to the fact there is zero security activity from any member of the Aldi staff, oh and just because a 60 yr old lady is shopping in Aldi and kicking up a fuss does not make her a innocent party.Bad show Aldi.",0,1
Aldi UK,Appalling customer service!,"Aldi are so focused on fast service that they entirely forget customer service, but yet they won't open up more than 2 tils. Maybe opening a few extra tils would allow the company to squeeze in some customer service? Most til operators don't even mutter a word to me, and carry on talking to their co worker. There's been many times I've been served alcohol because they've not even paid attention to what they are scanning. I get id'd everywhere else. So parents I warn you because your underage kids would probably be served because the staff in aldi's don't care. Also it's very hard to get around when it's busy because crates of food and miscellaneous stuff are left in the middle of every single aisle, surely that's against health and safety conduct somewhere? Yeah the stuff there is cheap but you are paying for what you get, often I'll have to throw away half of my fresh shopping because it's gone mouldy days before the use by date and I can barely get bread or meat that have a good few days before it goes out, bread is the worse often the bread runs out the next day.

We only get 1hr to do this which isn't long as we have to go pick list up, drive to shop, do shop and return. Most clients are elderly and alone so the shopping is usually only a few items. My area of work is Bingham Nottinghamshire, clients are in villages surrounding Bingham with some having no shop at all. Great Aldi opening a store way hey !!!!!! At least 8 tills but only ever seen 2 open ( and that's rare). My 1st bad experience was loading my shopping onto belt and waiting as I was the next. Half way through the customer (being served) I was told this till was closing and was asked to go to another till. No explanation why ? There was only 1 other till open, so all the people waiting after me moved to the other till. I asked the cashier why? Only to be told her LUNCH BREAK TIME had changed !!!!! And she'd been at work since 6 ( Not her problem). This resulted in me having to put goods back in basket and move to the other till to wait behind all the other customers that were behind me in first place. The cashier on this till had to ring for assistance, which took about 3 attempts for someone to assist. When a customer asked why only 1 till was open ? The reply was ""that's normal"" ""why do you think we all leave"".). So 15minutes later I get served, only 12 items and 30 minutes late to return shopping to client. Which also meant me being late for other clients.I stopped shopping at Aldi for a while and went to a lidl instead, they are pretty much the same when it comes to tills not being open, but at least they have self service checkouts for people with a few items. Today I finished work and went to Aldi for my own personal shopping as I rate the goods better than Lidl. Saturday afternoon busy busy. Went to till just closing. 2 other tills open but at least 3 customers with full trolleys, waiting!!!! Large signs above each till ""we will open another till when queue gets to here"". FORGET IT ALDI..... lIDL all the way,,,,,!,,,,,,L",0,1
Aldi UK,Poor,Aldi in Knocknacarra Galway I have noticed displays gone out of date food. I have seen this on three different occasions. Milk goes off very fast isn't pass two days. I bought chicken which had a few days on it and when I opened it had a gone off smell. It would take ages to find organic fruit and veg as it is all mixed together with the normal fruit and veg. When I told what looked like a manager ( rude as he was) that they should not be mixed he said he thinks it's better that way. Well you do not mix organic with other fruit and veg if there is a chance of gmo. I have rang customer care about gone off food three times now I don't care I have went back to supervalue. You think you are getting a bargain until you start opening their food and get the weird smell. And lastly your apple crumble and apple tart are terrible the apples are not cooked enough there are rank.,0,1
Aldi UK,"Bloomington, Indiana.  Great value; most of their foods are of a high quality, wish they'd boycott HFCS sugar.","I'd rate this at 4 1/2 if I could. I Iike a lot of the European sourced products that are generally unavailable elsewhere. Some of the ""special buys"" are outstanding, although I wish ALDI would query their customers on these products to see which ones they feel would be big sellers full-time. An example for me are frozen sweet potato fries....delicious, and not so fattening.I love Lambrusco wine, which is always stocked in 1.5 L bottles, at a VERY reasonable price. The variety of chocolates is also excellent. I love the high pulp orange juice. It can be diluted 3 to 1 and still be excellent. The Italian style rolls are also excellent if reheated correctly.The one frustration I might mention is that in the last aisle before the checkouts, across from the frozen food (at least in my store), where certain short-time foods are promoted, many times there is not a price posted for many items. It could be at least just magic-marked on the bulk boxes. One thing I have urged ALDI to do is eliminate foods with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) which is becoming the bane of foods from this country due to it's incredible cheapness for manufacturers, because of the generous corn price subsidies given to corn producers in the U.S. This form of sugar is literally killing us. If you are unaware of the hazards of this product, which today is in just about every American made food product containing sugar, check out one of the countless comments from doctors/nutritionists by Googling ""HFAC health impacts"". If you too are concerned about the pervasive use of this dangerous and unnecessary form of sugar, let ALDI (and anywhere else you shop for groceries) know you would like to have more products without HFCS. For example, it's become almost impossible to find a ketchup that doesn't contain it. They've all switched to HFCS because it is so darn cheap, thanks to price subsidies provided to American corn producers, paid for by....our taxes.",0,4
Aldi UK,On the whole food is okay but not the meat I'm afraid,"Inspired by the TV programme eat better for less, I decided to explore Aldi further. On the whole, the products are not bad and actually there are a couple of food items I just love from Aldi, so much so, I don't want to say on here in case 1) the price increases 2) supply reduces as demand increases. But this weekend we decided to give the meat a go! I have to say that Sunday lunch was a complete flop. The beef was so tough it could only have come from an old animal and it tasted horrid. No beef dripping came off it and even the roast potatoes were not up to my usual standard. Then we tried the lamp cutlets. Same problem there. The only thing that I can say, is that the dog has been fed well this bank holiday weekend whilst the family have almost become vegetarian. I have seen the Aldi meat advert and that's why I thought we would try the meat range. I don't think we will be tempted again and I do have catering qualifications and a heap of cooking experience.",0,3

Aldi UK,"Great for tools, poor for food","I have visited several stores in Birmingham, Halesowen and Oldbury. The service and friendliness varies between stores. My main complaint is how quickly food goes off, is shocking as the items are well within their expiry date. The bread is green after 2 days. Veg has got shortest shelf life in history. Unfortunately I have become use to your brands and I'm quite reluctant to shop elsewhere due to the excessive prices. Change suppliers or revert back to the ones you used 3-4 years ago as the ones you use now, you are allowing substandard quality goods to be stacked on your shelves. The tools you sell on the other hand are some of the best I have used and I buy a lot of snap on, makita and Bosch tools. It's a shame you can't sort the quality of the food out and you would have a very satisfied family as a customer.",0,2

I like that they make people go through the tills quick, its really annoying when I go in other supermarkets how slow it is.Plus i always buy a large amount and they always open a till for me to fill up all my stuff onto and come to me when i'm finished. Yes they shove my stuff through quick but they are not rude about it.i love the food, it tastes good and its cheap. I like that they are small, i really don't need 20 different choices of the same stuff.plus have you ever looked on the ingredients of aldi food?? it is more natural than ""brand"" goods just basic what should be in there instead of e numbers etc galore xxyes go to aldi, stores are not for brave but find when its quietest and go then",0,5
Aldi UK,No help for disabled customer,"I am usually more than happy with my local store, in Clacton on sea, Essex.I understand all the rush at the tills.They have to keep the cost down which they do.I am used to packing at my liesure at the shelves behind the checkouts, this I have also got used to doing, and for the difference in my food bill it is well worth it.But today when I asked if they had any of the Quorn sausage rolls that shared a price ticket with Quorn mince & potatoe pies, the lady assistant called to a male assistant, they both walked towards the freezer, (where I had already not located the Quorn sausage rolls, hence my question as to whether they had any.)The female returned shaking her head, then asked, 'Did you look through the whole lot?' She asked, adding,'They're on the same offer, so they all come in together.'I am disabled, my crutches were in the car, 'Oh but I can't do that, my crutches are in the car, if I let go of this trolley I'll end up in the freezer with the pies.' She raised her eyebrows at me then turned away, and went back to unpacking and stocking the freezer units.NO HELP WAS OFFERED",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi Pushy at tills,"Written by a Master of ManagementI leave Aldi with a bad aftertaste each and every time. Simply because I find the way in which you hurry people at the tills inappropriate; the term ""bullying innocent members of society"" jumps to mind. Don't get me wrong; I do understand that we live in a competitive world. I just do not agree with the idea that you treat people like clueless animals at your checkout points. Certainly, there are more ethical ways to compete. I could list them, but then I would be doing the work that Aldi Management is getting paid for.You will do well to ponder the meaning of the word ""respect"" going forward. Ethics is more often than not a core part of the curriculum if you study management at a reputable university. There is a good reason for it ... businesses that act in unethical ways sooner or later lose their credibility once society awakens. Good luck, and do consider that this is Great Britain, not Germany.",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi bully their customers,"I have stopped shopping at the Cambridge St Aldi in Aylesbury Bucks because I am fed up with being bullied by staff. I have had to put up with staff blocking access to shelves and not letting you just squeeze in for one item and then telling you to move out of their way. I have been blanked by staff when I have informed them of a shelf starting to fall down. I am too afraid to ask staff where items are because they are so manic and focused on what they are doing so I just go without. Most recently I was bullied at the till because I did not move my trolley around when she wanted me to. I have just spoken to customer services who have confirmed that they want their till staff to move people through as quickly as possible. Why are we paying for this lack of customer care? I have been looking at reviews online and I can see that Aldi have had some problems regarding their management staff bullying their serving staff so it seems to be their policy to just get as many 'units' through as possible. I, for one, refuse to put up with this treatment anymore.Bye Aldi - I won't be missing you!",0,1
Aldi UK,Parking Cowboys rip off pensioner,"I have just received a parking fine demand from the Cowboys Aldi lease their carparks to.

Aldi UK,Disgusting customer service,"I visited Aldi at DROITWICH in Worcs and I am disgusted at the way customers are treated at this store. For sometime now the stores customer service has been getting worse with ignorant staff and check out staff rushing you at the check out but on Sunday enough is enough. While we were chosing some bread a member of staff armed with a tray of bread asked us to move out of the way because he wanted to fill the shelf he would not wait while we chose our shopping but just barged in to us customers don't matter. I don't know of any other supermarked that would allow their staff to treat their customers this way, and I will not be shopping at Aldi again, I would rather pay the extra cost and shop at another supermarket than experience the rudeness at this store. Aldi think that they can treat their customers as they like because of their cut prices but the tide will turn (read other comments on this site) and customers will not accept the disrespect shown by their staff anymore. Aldi some of your staff at Droitwich are the 'pits' and you should be ashamed that you employ such ignorant and rude people in your company..",0,1

Aldi UK,Anti-Social Building Work carried out by Aldi until 2am,"Aldi- Milnsbridge, Huddersfield.I complained regarding contractors carrying out work on the canopy and signage at their store on Scar Lane in Milnsbridge over the weekend of 22nd July to 25th July.The village is a residential area and two of my bedroom windows overlook their building. The works were also heard my neighbours.At 11:30pm on the 22nd July contractors started work on the canopy using a cherry picker with the engine going constantly and the continuous beep beep beep beep. This then woke my 2 year old nephew who then would not go back to sleep because he thought this was an alien (bless him - vivid imagination).When I spoke to the contractors they informed me they have been instructed by Aldi to carry out this work at this time and proceeded to work through to 2am. As a result of this I rang Kirklees Council Noise Pollution Night time team, they asked me to keep a log.The same thing happened on Saturday night with work starting at 10:45pm and going through until about 1am.The same again on Sunday afternoon this time from 5pm through to 11pm/midnight but worse as the contractors were using a noisy paint sprayer and the fumes were being blown into my house. Being asked to shut my windows was like a red rag to a bull, it was the hottest time of the year!!I had a very ratty 2 year old nephew who for two days was disturbed by Aldi contractors and a migraine from the paint fumes.I rang Customer Services to report this only to be advised that they couldn’t do anything and also it may be that they have planning permission to do this. Following that conversation I spoke with the Kirklees Planning Office they have confirmed that there is no such planning permission for works to be carried out at these unsociable hours.Customer Service were smug, arrogant and unsympathetic and have not responded to my email or given a courtesy call or even apologised.I think WHICH needs to look at who they dish out awards to in future.

Aldi UK,Really going downhill,"Where do i start, had i known this was here, i would have sounded off long before.Meat joint, Beef to be exact, better quality (you think) well, it had at least 30% water, it was grey, not rotting matter grey, But , this was scary, i wasted £8.79 because i couldn't cook it, it was in date, it was to be cooked that night but sadly it was not to be. the veg rots withing days, as do the potatoes, the bananas cook in their skins, The tomatoe and chilli relish, (specially selected) has altered dramatically. It is a orange grease full of onion and is sweet, instead of tomatoe and chilli, so, they have either got the mix wrong, or are conning people, becaue really it looks like the real thing and i have bought lots but the last two i have thrown them as they are not worth returning. They have become arrogant and smug and the awards they seem to get are based on the better stores situated in better places. Most store i go in they are stinking smelly badly stocked and i wont go anymore. If i had a job assessing aldi/lidl, etc they would not get very good ratings from me. Anyway, i don't so i shall rate them as a very average but fussy ex customer. your cutbacks show, taste is essential and at least some quality because most of your pricing is way over what the product actually calls for.

Aldi UK,Very poor customer support on expensive electrical goods,"I bought a TV for £299 in 2009, it now needs another remote control since the original one has failed. It seems impossible to track down a compatible remote control through ALDI and their comment is that since the warranty was 3 years only, they do not now offer support for the TV. Since the TV is likely to have an operational life of 10 years or more this attitude is very unhelpful. I will not buy expensive goods from ALDI in future and I would suggest people should be careful when deciding to buy such items. ALDI is not a company to be trusted for after sales support.Following this comment, I was contacted by a very helpful man from ALDI who gave me a contact for a supplier, via Amazon, who was able to supply me with the correct remote control, which works well. It would make sense for ALDI to provide this information, routinely, via their helpline. ALDI customer service would be improved by doing this.",0,1
Aldi UK,All about keeping prices low apparently,"I had a rather ordinary visit to Aldi's, Inverurie until I reached the checkout. Apparently, the staff are given "" scanning "" targets, very unrealistic by the way. This would explain the formula one speed of whizzing your goods through and expecting you to keep up. The usual lack of staff on checkouts doesn't help and when I politely asked a manager, who was working on the till, why there was a lack of staff, he promptly told me that it's all about keeping the prices down ......really, I thought, well I'd rather have a "" pleasant "" experience whilst shopping and not end up feeling stressed on the way out. Call me old fashioned, but I dislike this new supermarket ethos of low low prices ( in their opinion ) and a total disregard to customer service and giving you the time of day. Needless to say I have not returned to Aldi. Would seem it's all about losing customers Aldi !",0,2
Aldi UK,"Aldi Maidstone are great, as are the main customer service team.","I had an online order returned to Aldi by its carrier as the packaging was damaged. I spoke to customer service and they were so helpful, not only apologetic but also offering to phone Maidstone branch to check what they had from that order in stock. They also arranged for it to be put aside for me and gave me a voucher as an apology. Finally, it took me a week to collect-I spoke to the store manager to check they still had the stuff for me and they did. I collected two days later, the manager (Martin) was on the shop floor shelf filling and was able to give me my order with no problem. Also a friendly person which was nice. I have had no problems with Aldi or their products-both food and housewares.

They offered me a refund for the product I was ""unhappy"" with and that's it. I've consumed food deemed not fit for human consumption because they have a bad stock rotation system. The dog enjoyed it though. We also had various other goods including a pork pie we bought on the 15th with the 15ths date on - that seemed fine to eat so we did, same with some custard slices with the same days date.

Aldi UK,Absolutely unacceptable.,"Hi,I thought I'd share my horrific experience with Aldi. I would have rated this 0 stars, if there was an option.Firstly, the feel when you walk into the store is atrocious. The dismal atmosphere just makes you want to walk out again. There is no music to listen to while you shop, and you can actually hear footsteps on the floor, it's so quiet and boring.Next, I'd like to inform you about the disgraceful quality of their products. I have had friends and family members, and also witnessed myself, some of the purely disgusting quality of their goods. A friend of mine told me about finding a burnt black coal-like crisp in their packet, and another friend said about garlic dough balls with no garlic in, just loose, watery garlic butter in the bottom of the bag. I also heard a story from a family member wherein there seemed to be PURE undissolved sugar in the bottom of an Aldi energy drink. How they think this can get past quality control, I don't know.Finally, I am outraged by the attitude of staff members in Aldi stores. Just recently I went to have a look around the shop and heard many people being shouted at by cashiers, and told off for asking for another till to be opened (a problem in itself). They simply throw your goods to the end of the till, and will shout to ask whether you need a bag. Do they possibly know how much they are affecting their customers?This is probably just one of many experiences that have not been pleasant throughout the whole of this review section, and I hope they will do something about the problem effective immediately.Thanks.",0,1

Aldi UK,I feel Aldi chicken packaging may have caused my microwave fire - I feel Aldi don't care,"I regularly used to buy chicken fillets from Aldi, and sometimes freeze them and defrost in a microwave later.Recently, Aldi have put metal security tags in the layers of plastic underneath stickers on their packaging, which I feel may burst into flames in the microwave. I feel the plastic packaging may be flammable, so this may spread the fire. Luckily I was paying attention, otherwise it might have ended up in a major incident! There has been a couple of reports in newspapers about this, but as far as I can see, I feel Aldi have done nothing to protect their customers.I feel the worst part is Aldi's reaction to it...- I feel they've been consistently evasive and dismissive, and I feel the wording of the customer service emails is trying to avoid legal liability.- They point out there's a warning on the package - that's completely true, but in what I consider to be tiny size, under a general heading about security. Clearly I shouldn't have microwaved the package, but my concern is that others may make the same mistake as me. I feel this is a real risk which it would be reasonable for Aldi to address. I've asked they change this to something like 'Warning - do not place in microwave' as a simple adjustment to protect their customers, but as far as I'm aware, they don't seem interested to me. It seems to me that a font which I find unreadable under a heading which I feel doesn't hint at the danger is OK to them!- They tell me the packaging isn't flammable... even when I've sent them pictures of it actually on fire!- I feel I've received no proper apology, no constructive dialog, not even replacement chicken - and I consider they have apathy about protecting customers' lives and properties. I feel I've warned them clearly - if someone should get hurt, one could suggest it's now on them.",0,1
Aldi UK,going downhill fast,"i have shopped in my local aldi store in haverfordwest since it opened,maybe 6yrs now.the quality and prices of its products were what drew me in,however...i am now doing a lot of my shop elsewhere as the quality has really gone downhill.fruit and veg go off in the blink of an eye,especially fresh green beans,i have to pick through the packs instore as they are mouldy and soft on the shelf,and if u dont use them within a day or two,they have gone off! fruit goes off before its ripe enough to eat,i throw away half of what i buy as cant eat it quick enough.tomatoes are the worst,again,check very carefully when you buy them as most of the packet tomatoes are squidgy and bit mouldy in store!they do a range of teabags called diplomat english tea,loved the taste,but theyve made the bags so thin now,if you dont take great care pulling the pairs of teabags part,you end up with tea everywhere,really frustrating!if you shop there on a friday evening,the shelves are stripped bare,no veg left,essential stuff has all gone,it cant be that difficult to order enough surely?the last 3 fresh legs of lamb i have bought from there have been really tough and chewy,and the fresh steaks are gristley and chewy also,and i do know how to cook beef and lamb,i wont buy any more im afraid. having said that,the staff are fantastic,always happy and chatty,its like shopping in your corner store.there are still good products in store at good prices,but you have to be very choosey or go elsewhere for fresh fruit,veg and meats,and learn to shop at the right times or theres nothing left.",0,3

Aldi UK,I recently purchased a HOLLY LANE MADEIRA CAKE from Norwich store.,"We purchased the above cake for a family gathering and when my partner was eating the last piece she alerted myself that there was something looking like a pearl in the side, on looking closer it was found to be a tailors pin you secure hems etc with when sewing, i took photos and called head office straight away they gave me an incident number and told me to return it to the store to the manager, it would then be collected and return to head office were the quality control would look at the situation. i received mail this morning saying that no other incidents had been reported and it sounded like they were suggesting that we had placed it there, was given a £10 voucher as a good will, so my family is worth that if any 1 of them had swallowed this, well all i can say is that they need better testing equipment for these incidents.

Aldi UK,Aldi's could be the best supermarket ever,"For years I was very reluctant, didn't like how they treated you at the till, horrid stores. miserable staff etc. Now I just love it, I come out every time with a smile on my face. Several bags of shopping and I've only spend £50, I'm sure it would cost me almost double in Morrisons. They now also have lots of fancy foods so I don't even have to go to another supermarket to get my smoked mackerel, pies, coleslaw, nice cuts of meat, nuts, breads etc.Nearly everything I purchase I am happy with the quality, I think superior to Asda.But one word of warning,,,,Don't buy the Stuffed Duck. I know it was very reasonable priced, but I didn't even get a handful of meat. It was pure skin, fat and stuffing, in fact it would have been a heart attack if I'd have bitten into it. Please Aldi take it off your shelf, it's unhealthy, cheap fat and skin that I wouldn't feed to my dog, and it lets the whole supermarket down. The staff seem slightly better but what do I expect I'm paying for value for money, quality food not posh stores, or staff that have the time to chat about the weather with me.",0,4

Then rudely told ""go to tesco if you want a service that allows you to pay for packing bag at till"" shocked as man wasn't even serving me.. what has it got to do with him and what a stupid thing to say. Aldi may be cheap so is their customer service. Complete garbageHello tesco. Aldi just told me to use you. I didn't argue. I spoke to the manager or deputy. Don't think they care. Even contacted aldi on Facebook. They want till number . Ectopic. Sorry I am not doing your job for you. You have rude cashier who just lost you a customer and told me to use tesco.

Aldi UK,Trolley saftey,"Anyone shopping with small children will know that shopping with children at aldi is ten times more stressful. For the simple reason they have removed all the lap straps designed to stop toddlers standing up from the seating are and potentially falling head first to the hard floor. Despite being right next to them the slighted distraction is long enough for them to have a fatal accident. I've commplained endlessly to store staff to look at me and say they hadn't been aware.

And today when i went in one of the cashiers closed his till as i got to it even though i only had a small basket with 4 things in it so had to wait for ages behind a girl with a months worth of shopping. After the cashier finished faffing about with the card machine, She wasnt especially friendly just seemed like she had enough of her shift. Made no attempt at conversation and didnt try to get more cashiers to help when there was a giant queue forming. So much for aldis policys on line size.

Aldi UK,ongoing poor customer service,"Returned a faulty product with the receipt, sum to be refunded was 34.99 gbp. Upon checking my receipt, found that I had only been refunded 24.99 gbp. Took the matter up with the checkout person and was told that the goods were 24.99 gbp on the system, she then checked the receipt that had been given to her and refunded the missing 10gbp. No apology was given by herself or the store manager. Clearly, had I not spotted the lapse sooner I would have had no reasonable chance of a refund. I do not think that this could have easily happened at one of our UK big 4, because their staff do not under the same time pressures and they have a much better attitute towards customers. Last manager at same Aldi store was borderline rude.Stephen SaylesBarnsley",0,1

Aldi UK,"ALDI in Hatfield, 2nd of March 2016: Rip-off!","My spouse bought some drinking water for £ 1.99 and handed a £ 20 note for payment. She was given £ 3.01 in change. She then remarked that she had given a £ 20 note for payment. The cashier said that she had received a £ 5 bill from my spouse. My spouse then asked that the cashier would please look into the cash register, since she had given her a £ 20 brand new note and one could easily see this. The cashier refused to look. Another employee came and said that he seen it on streaming video monitor. He claimed that it was a £ 5 bill.Can you see the difference between a £ 20 and a £ 5 note on a small screen? Both refused to check the cash register for a brand new £ 20 note! My spouse asked for the manager. The male employee, who had come and had seen it on the monitor, said that he was the manager. They insisted that my spouse had given a £ 5 note. My spouse was absolutely certain because she had had only two brand new £ 20 notes in her wallet! The employees refused to make a cash check, despite the explicit request of my spouse. Very unfriendly, rude and disrespectful! Would they have acted differently if it had been a man?",0,1

There is nothing intuitive about the placement of different items in the store.

Aldi UK,Tasteless food poor quality fiddled reviews,"I have bought a few things in Aldi in the past but have given up as often I find when I get them home the food and drink is of such poor quality that I end up throwing it away and buying replacements so it costs me more. I got given an Aldi bottle of wine as a present and looked on their website to find only 5 star reviews about this product . Maybe things had changed I thought, until I tried the wine. It has to be one of the worst tasting wines I have ever had and believe me some of the cheap wines I've tried when abroad haven' been the best. This product is fit for cleaning with or at most using in cooking, not drinking. So I went on the Aldi website to leave a 1 star review, carefully following all their guidelines to the letter. I then receive an email from customer services to say my review had been rejected as it didn't meet the guidelines. Did I miss the guideline that said only 5 star reviews would be published. I tried to contact them to ask them to explain what guideline my review did not meet and have received no response. Now I know how all their products get good reviews, they reject any that aren't!",0,1

My fruit and veg is always fresh from aldi, i suppose that comes from experience and being able to tell the difference between a green and yellow banana, tomatoes well you can feel the firm ones from the soft ones, apples buy the decent ones, pears absolutely fine, cabbage, brocolli, cauli all fine, carrots, chartonney ones on offer very good. potatoes... always get maris piper never had a problem, fresh chickens .... fresh , rump steaks very nice and cheap, try the indian meals for one at under 1.50 they are the best i have had. cheese selection good, frozen pizzas, sometimes they dont have the ones i like sometimes they do, but the barbeque chicken, pepporoni and spinach and ricotta are fantastic. try the fish cakes they are superb with a baked spud and a bit of veg.sorry but nothing but praise, p.s. the wine is pretty good too at under £5 a bottle but hey go elsewhere pay more be happy i certainly am. based on how busy it gets the moaners are in the minority but its always easier to moan than write a review in any context.did you realise aldi sell coca cola. i dont like the chocolate or snacks that much i prefer cadburys chocolate, so there are some things i will go elsewhere for but as a whole the smaller store, knowing where everything is the savings.... good for me.",0,5
Aldi UK,Aldi's Customer Services are uncontactable online.,"I like to go through the normal processes to deal with customer service issues. Aldi throw obstacles in the way. The email address for customer service constantly returns a message that it is full and their online form will not recognise normal phone numbers, fonts and punctuation, preventing one from submitting comments. It's a shame and suggests a company either overwhelmed, or unwilling to put in the resources to resolve issues.",0,1
Aldi UK,Disrespectful treatment,"Whilst Aldi still boasts cheap prices and good products it has gone downhill in its customer care. Staff are sullen and rude. I am tired of the negative atmosphere in the store. The checkouts are atrocious, with your items being nearly thrown at you once you have waited in a long queue.

As the checkout girl was hurling my shopping into a great big pile at a ridiculous rate of knotts she rudely demands I just put it in the trolly and then bag it up later. Why on earth would I want to do that? What a waste of MY time. I told her I'm fine as I am and continued bagging my shopping as I would in any other supermarket; which I did, accompanied by evil looks and sighs from the cashier. She really tried to put the pressure on as all my shopping piled up on the ridiculously small area next to the till: raw meet shoved on top of cooked meat etc etc. Also the store is so poorly laid out. The fruit and veg and chilled food aisles were heaving with customers and staff trying to restock shelves yet 1/2 the store devoted to pet food and toiletries was complete devoid of people. I know this shop is supposed to be cheap and cheerful - well it certainly wasn't cheerful - in fact quite the opposite - I shan't be returning.",0,1

Aldi UK,ABYSMAL new wine online service - Please read to avoid disappointment,"I ordered four cases of wine. One box of mixed wines (ordered specifically to sample the wider range of wines) was short delivered. Aldi's Customer service only allows for compensation by a voucher against another order. So when they tell you that they will refund the cost and pay you for the inconvenience of re-ordering and repaying for another delivery you will only get a small voucher against a future online order.

Aldi UK,Mistreatment and Falsely Accusing customers,"A friend and myself went in Aldi on 29/01/16 - we both bought stuff and were watched by staff packing our stuff away.My friend decided to go back into the store from the till for more stuff - and I waited with his shopping. When he paid for that, I went to their LOCKED glass cabinet to see how much their DAB radios were.We both left the store - then got stopped by 2 members of staff (NOT Security) in the CAR PARK of a nearby store. They DEMANDED that they search our bags and his trolley - then accused us of stealing goods from the store that we had bought elsewhere (2 sets of headphones I had bought in HMV) about 20 minutes earlier.When they were proven wrong, NO apology was given - and when I reported it to their Customer Service Department online, I was told ""It is standard policy to stop and search customers, whenever we feel like it.""Again, they didn't apologise properly - they just said ""we look forward to your continued custom."" I then called them to raise the complaint further - before finding an email address for their Head Office in the UK, where I sent copies of the emails to their UK managers.At present, I am waiting for a reply - but thought people had a right to know what to expect from the Aldi staff and management in their stores - and what kind of reply they will receive if they complain.",0,1
Aldi UK,Probably the Worst Online Customer Service Ever,"I received a fine through the post for parking 13 minutes too long in the Morecambe car park. I complained because I had been in store the whole time and had my receipt as proof.They cancelled the fine but when I pointed out to them that they owed me an apology, they sent an outright refusal to apologise for the inconvenience of me having to photocopy receipts and other documents, and then go to the post office to post the papers and get proof of postage. Wouldn't even refund the cost of the postage stamp.They didn't even thank me for shopping in their store on the day, or acknowledge me for being a regular customer.Their products might be cheap but so is common courtesy and good customer care.

It makes my back terrible, the speed at which I have to bend over and stretch.The past 2 weeks I have had to take painkillers because of the pain for hours after I get home.This week the lad put all the wrong things on the bill as I have to do 2 separate transactions- I separate the goods at the till and put a divider between them, but he just swiped the next lot on the same bill.I can't afford to go to Asda any more...but they were far better at the tills.",0,3

Aldi UK,Some issues but prices good,"After several years shopping at 4 nearby branches I have mixed opinions.The Manchester Arndale Centre shop is far too small, always very overcrowded and they have now ditched the tiny packing shelf and introduced an 'everybody in one queue' system which I'm sure is slower than the previous dozen tills. There is nowhere to pack your shopping - appalling.The Cheadle Heath branch puts offer prices on items and then charges the full price. I have had this out with them several times but nothing changes. When you complain they are not pleasant. Their aisles are full of cages and staff shelf-filling. The special offer area looks like a jumble sale.The Stockport branch seems to be the best run of the 4 but they share the car park of the bingo club next door and woe-betide anyone who forgets to put their registration number into the car park machine as there is a huge fine awaiting.At Heaton Chapel it's usually impossible to get at half the shelves due to cages filling the aisles and shelf-fillers. Price labels on shelves are often misleading, with the wrong price directly under an item. Despite all the shelf-filling the special items area is still shambolic. They are very good at opening extra tills when needed at this store.I've returned unwanted items to 3 of these 4 stores and never had a problem getting a refund.",0,3

Aldi UK,Spoken from an unbiased employee.,"I did not shop in aldi until I started to work there 4months ago, personally I have not yet seen the poor service others have complained about, at all, regardless of which store I've shopped in. I do admit that the speed at the till really frustrates me, and as a chatty person myself, I feel extremely rushed and awkward once a transaction is finished and I wait for the customer to grab their items and leave, because I feel pressured to rush them - that is not something I feel comfortable with doing as if it was me as the customer, I know I'd be appalled. As other employees have stated and I will make crystal clear: WE DO NOT INFLUENCE ANY OF THE RULES OF THE COMPANY, WE SIMPLY ENFORCE THESE RULES AS IT IS OUR JOB TO, THEREFORE ANY COMPLAINTS SHOULD NOT BE DIRECTED TOWARDS US, AS WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY IN WHICH ALDI IS RUN. I must admit that a problem we do have is minimal staff, which makes it tricky for us to get everything done, especially as the Altrincham store I work in is quite large. One issue I have with customers though, is that they are quick to complain about ""out of date"" products but they are the ones who do not take stock from the front, instead they rummage through the shelves, leaving the shelves a mess and stock dates mixed up.. We simply don't have the time to clean up after customers.Since working with Aldi I have realised that all stock is kept in the right places in store, correct procedures are followed when storing particular food items (especially poultry) and that we are thorough with making sure that out of date products are removed from the shelve the night before their sell by date! The warehouse is kept as tidy as one can be kept during the day, and is swept, (and mopped if necessary) after the store closes, if there are any problems with food items purchased, I am not shifting blame but is is down to the manufacturer, not the employees in the supermarket, and even then.. There isn't much that can be done about poor product quality other than a replacement, and the company to be stricter with manufacturing policies?!I am mainly on the till as my stacking speed isn't great, but I treat each customer individually and cater to their needs, regarding if they are disabled, or elderly, personally I believe that people are being extremely critical of our service and shouldn't be expecting so much from a discount store anyway! In the store I work in, the majority my colleagues are nice and as patient as I am with customers, but at the end of the day, like any other company, we have jobs to do, and targets to meet and people fail to understand that.I am proud to both work for and represent aldi and all their success, and it simply comes down to this.. If you are not happy with aldi, and have an issue, contact the headquarters and highlight the issues and what you think can be done to improve, but I don't you should slate the store on a review site, when you are simply only highlighting the issues, and not what is good about us. We work very hard to maintain low prices, a clean store, and a product range, which complies to variety of customers needs.. If you don't like aldi, don't shop there. But it is unnecessary to make petty complaints in an attempt to slate our image.",0,4
Aldi UK,Human or Rodent Hair in my tomatoes,I opened a tin of Aldi premium tomatoes yesterday and found a black fine hair floating on the top of the tomatoes. Could be human or a large rodent. I contacted Aldi customer services who told me no one else had complained and just take them back for a refund.

Let me count the ways:I choose to shop at Aldi out of necessity, because they do have good products at a lower cost than their competitors (I first go to Aldi, then I must go to another grocery store, usually Walmart to buy things that Aldi doesn't carry or has items have moved again to a different location within the store that I couldn't locate.Check out is a nightmare, their cashiers start to ring items before you can get to the register to make sure you are paying what you expected, and then as they ring up your items they throw them back into another cart (often damaging the soft goods and produce!I shopped there last night and now have to go back again because of a damaged item and an over charge (bought 4 pair of socks. 2 men and 2 women with different cost for each type and was charged for 3 higher priced and 1 at the lower). Watch out when cashiers try to 'bundle' like items!The people that work there are by far the worst, I believe Aldi management has made a work model to do more with less and it's all about speed not about the customers! SHAME ON ALDI MANAGEMENT FOR BEING INSENSITIVE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!",0,2
Aldi UK,Bread,I shop at Aldi regularly but very disappointed with the selection of bread. Always buy my bread elsewhere for freshness,0,1
Aldi UK,Parking fine not appreciated,"My wife managed to get a £70 parking fine (reduced to £40 for quick payment cheers for that!) at Morecambe Aldi. Her of course for overstaying by 15 minutes ( she came across an old friend in Aldi whilst shopping then went for a cup of coffee with her at nearby Morriusons - Aldi don't have a cafe). She didn't realise that parking was limited to one and a half hours. (Morrisons have two hours free parking).Her fault of course for not reading the notice properly so no real excuse so I'vIe paid up. In future, however we'll shop at Morrisons and have a cuppa there within their two hour free parking period. A £40 fine makes a large hole in my pension. Aldi will lose more over time than the £40 I've paid to the Parking Eye Company",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi revisted and a Fail,"Our closest Aldi store is a 40 mile round trip, Tesco's 26miles.. so in order to entice us to shop there the prices have to be really keen, but more importantly, the quality of fresh produce top notch..For the past few weeks we have tried to do a full shop in Aldi.. to see if the extra travel would be cost effective.. only going to Tescos for things that they don't stock.. (or we couldn't find) .. like Atora Suet, some toiletries, dish washing rinse-aid and salt and another few items.. not critical.. and as we pass Tesco on the way, no hassle..My assessment..The Good Dairy: eggs, mild, butter and cheeses all good quality and good prices. Fresh meat. Only tried a few products, generally buy meat at the butcher or Makro in bulk, but what we have bought, has been good quality and keenly priced Cooked meats and deli foods. Good quality and good selection.. prices about average. Frozen meals, Pizza etc . Don't buy so cannot comment. Bread and cakes. Don't buy, bake my own.. so no comment.. Tinned and dry foods. What we have tried have been OK. Fruit juices. Good quality and good prices..And now that bad. Fresh fruit vegetables are poor, carrots often soft in a few days, apples bruised, tomatoes over ripe, generally poor quality and poor selection.. This week I bought 6 pomegranates and threw them in the bin.. I have sent photos and a letter to Aldi, not for a refund but to inform. To be fair, the Savoy cabbage and cauliflower were very good.. just a shame the other fruit & veg let them down..The bulk of our shop is fruit and veg.. if they fail in this department then it's not worth travelling an extra 14 miles (round trip) to save a few pennies on the other produce.. and still have to visit Tesco's for odds and ends..In general, the shopping experience was poor, rushed at the check-out, ( I hate that ) the store has been cold, even the workers were wrapped up .. no customer facilities, busy cramped aisles.. store too small for the number of customers.. and certainly not enough staff.. long queues at check-outs.Compared to shopping in Tesco's or Sainsbury's , Aldi is a poor experience.. cheaper no doubt but we will only go in if we are looking for something in their special offers.. we won't be doing a weeks shop there again.. sorry Aldi .. we gave you a fair try and you FAILED. There is more to shopping than just lower prices.",0,2
Aldi UK,new malden is very poor,"why? so cheap, so nasty.ridiculous queues, and you have to navigate a prison style checkout system... just awful. feels like you have guards in towers watching you shop.",0,1
Aldi UK,"New Malden ALDI Rude staff, no idea about customer service!!","Check out counter staff (majority)behavior is the worst. They keep on throwing your shopping at you on a very confined counter and some of the shopping fallen off the counter.They are taking the mickey out of customers.I am surprised why authorities who suppose to protect customers have not yet taken any action against these bunch of ill mannered company staff and their company.I have not been shopping at his horrible place since and I discourage every one of my friends, family and colleagues not to shop at places like ALDI. It is true , you get what you paid for.If you want a decent customer care who value your business shop in Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys or Waitrose!!!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,RUDE AND YOKELISH STAFF,"I really detest ALDI,theres no proper managment or staff,tills are always closed, seems like one should buy in ALDI and scan and pay in ASDA at least ASDA got self check out machines.The CEO of ALDI must be shopping in waitrose,cos you and i know for sure its a dump supermarket.",0,1
Aldi UK,Employee at UK Aldi,"I work at an Aldi in South East England and felt like I had to explain a few things as a lot of the responses sound similar.First of all, Aldi does not have employees with specific job roles. We have stock/store assistants. ALL store assistants are trained to work on the shop floor and on the tills. Tills are closed as quickly as possible if there is room on the remaining tills as the cashier has work to do on the shop floor, for example making sure all the bread is on the shelves and that no spaces are left empty. We don't sit around on tills waiting for customers like most supermarkets do. By multi tasking, the company can hire less people to run a shift, this in turn helps to keep prices lower as less staff = fewer wages to pay. When we are on the tills we do have a procedure which is to ask the customer to pack all the shopping back into the trolley until the transaction is finished. The customer then packs their shopping at the packing bench or at their car. This is how we keep down our queues down, which, guess what, means less employees on tills! This is also why we have to scan fast, we have a required till speed which is determined by the average spend in each individual store. Products are scanned along the scanner, not thrown. The items wouldn't scan if we were throwing them so I never understand why people say that...May I also remind people that Aldi have a returns policy which is printed on the back of the receipt which clearly shows how many days you have to return an item and also states that the receipt must be shown. It's not rocket science. If your product has a warranty on it, the number for after sales is printed on the box/packaging. It is in there hands after the return period is over to bring it back to store. I honestly can't see what's so hard to follow here...And please can customers remember that store assistants/deputy managers/assistant mangers do not decide how Aldi run their business. We are only following what our contract has asked us to do, don't argue with us if we tell you to pack at the station. We are just doing our jobs! If you have a complaint about how Aldi decide to do things then please take it to headquarters or to the directors. The person sitting on a till scanning your food is not responsible for the system!",0,5
Aldi UK,Overall pretty rubbish,"I shopped here for the first time this week and after hearing good things i was looking forward to it but ended up being very disappointed. I know it is a cheap supermarket so i was not expecting it to be fantastic but everything from food to clothes etc seemed to be thrown onto the shelves or baskets they were in. They do not care about presentation at all. Everything was in random places including the floor which no one seemed to be picking up. The checkouts all were closing at 11am except for one and instead of telling me they were closing they shouted it at me horrifically! The checkouts are absolutely tiny, the man was throwing my items at me and not giving me time to get them into my trolley. I will not be coming back as my overall experience is of it was absolutely rubbish!!",0,2
Aldi UK,Contaminated soya milk,"I bought a carton of Acti Leaf soya milk in the Benfleet, Essex store 2 days ago & went to pour it on my cereal, when a slimy nasty green item slipped out onto my food.On closer inspection, I realised it was some sort of leaf (not sure if it was a soya plant leaf), which had turned the milk bitter & discoloured. I tasted a small amount of the milk which was absolutely disgusting.More importantly, I could have choked on the 'leaf' if I hadn't seen it slime out of the carton.I phoned customer services who asked me to quote the bar code number on the carton, but all there were only black lines with no numbers. The advisor insisted that there must be numbers & made me feel like an idiot for not seeing the non existent numbers!I told her that I work in retail & deal with bar codes all day, so Im not stupid & could categorically say that there were no numbers. Eventually, she said all I could do was to go back to the store & bring it yo their attention with a reference number which she gave me.I was appalled by this because the offending item could've choked or poisoned me & further cartons could also be affected. She didn't seem bothered by that as ""nobody else has complained"". What sort of a response is that?! A child could be the next person to be affected by something that ALDI is selling, & which could potentially be fatal until its checked out. ALDI is relying on me taking it back to the store before they take any action, but the real responsibility lies with ALDI & not me, so I feel that theyre poor excuse for a customer service is totally inadequate & seems to have no duty of care for its customers.I only went shopping at ALDI as my local LIDL has closed for a refurb. I cant wait for LIDL to re-open as their produce is far more superior. I'll never shop at ALDI again as I've lost all trust in their food & service, & count myself lucky I didn't end up with food poisoning or worse.",0,1
Aldi UK,Broken Long Handle Shears,"Being a long supporter and also,purchaser of tools ,when the shears I bought from Aldi broke after 2 months I was surprised that their customer service refused to exchange them UNLESS I provided a till receipt.Like most people(especially those that shop regularly at a store)receipts aren't diligently kept especially for an item of about £10 -and these tools are ONLY available at their stores(and I wasn't looking for a cash refund).I wrote to their Marketing Manager two weeks ago but todate no reply!!Obviously Customer Service means being ignored and shop elsewhere!!",0,1
Aldi UK,"Great value, Excellent service","I regularly shop at Aldi in Kendal. The staff are friendly, helpful, and amazingly quick. So much better that any of our other local supermarkets (Morrison's, Asda and Booths)The quality of most food products is generally very good, and sometimes excellent, particularly their steaks, fruit and veg, croissants and goats cheese. I have been disappointed with a couple of purchases, some of the canned fish was not particularly good.With their special buys, you usually get reasonable value. I have bought a few tools from them, they were cheap, not brilliant but good value for the price.",0,4
Aldi UK,Brought chicken and choked on a bone,"Brought chicken fillets from Aldi to make chicken wraps and bit into one, swallowed and I started choking, once I stopped choking and spat my food out, I noticed it was a piece of bone that I choked on, won't be shopping here again, it's dangerous and its traumatised me 😷😐😤",0,1
Aldi UK,Allergic reaction to Lacura body lotion,After using Aldi's Lacura body lotion for two days I developed an allergic reaction. I have used nothing different apart from this cream. A severe itching rash has developed over most of my body. I have had to attend GP out of hours and purchase pescriptions. This has now gone on for 10 days and it has been awful. I contacted Aldi customer service who thanked me for my complaint and said they woul pass my views in! I again contacted them and told them that I thought their response was not good enough ! Silence - well done Aldi - may be they should be reminded that customers make a business !,0,1
Aldi UK,Glass in Food - Poor Customer Care,"I bought a prepared salad meal from Aldi which had a 1/2 inch piece of glass in it which stuck in and cut the roof of my mouth.I phoned the Aldi customer services line who gave me a complaint reference number and requested I take the item, packaging and the receipt back to the Aldi store some miles away which I did.The manager sort of listened to my story, took the items but didn't even apologise for the problem until prompted.Some days later Aldi customer services phoned me to inform me they would send me a ""token for the problem"" whatever that means.A few days later I received a massive total of £15 of Aldi vouchers which hardly covered my fuel and the salad costs, let alone my time and suffering.Did you see the TV investigative program on Aldi, very informative.Maybe cheaper prices, but comes over as a company that doesn't care about its regular customers like me.If you have problems like this it may be better not to go to Aldi but go to the Trading Standards as Aldi doesn't deserve your help and cooperation by treating people in this way.A big fine might alter their outlook to this type of incident.I, my family and friends will never shop there again after being treated in this way. I feel I have been used for the benefit of Aldi and it's suppliers.A very unhappy shopper",0,1
Aldi UK,Felt like crying!,"I am writing to you today to tell you about my upsetting experience this morning at your Bilston Branch. Today is rememberence day. I got to your store at 10:58 as the radio announced the 2 minute silence, I personally don't do the 2 minutes silence as I don't believe in war. But out of respect for those around me I remained in the car until the 2 minutes on the radio had finished. There is a memorial right by your bilston branch which was still having their 2 minute silence unbenones to me! I went to collect a trolley and a colleague of yours started to tut at me. The memorial then made a big sound to let everyone know it has finished (so their timing was wrong to those on my radio) as it finished she went on to then say to her other colleagues how disrespectful I was! I feel so upset I wanted the ground to open up and swolllow me! I continued to do my shopping upset wanting to burst into tears. I didn't have to remain in my car for the 2 mins the silence was on the radio - but I did out of respect and yet I get out and have to do my shopping feeling ashamed and embarrassed! I do a £60-£80 shop per week at your store and I won't be coming back here again as I feel to embarrassed due to your staff! I don't usually complain but on this occasion I felt it was necessary I sent this to aldi today!",0,1
Aldi UK,How does Aldi win so many awards each year?,"Checkout queues were well past the ""we'll open a new checkout"" signs, no problem because a new checkout got opened just as an Aldi staff member wanted to pay for the shopping she got after the end of her shift, however when I went to join the queue the checkout was suddenly closed, when I complained a new checkout was eventually opened and I advised the manager what had happened, however the new checkout operator overheard and started to give his two pence worth to be, being very cocky and with an attittude, I advised he shouldn't speak to customers like that and he threw the change into my hand, I again spoke to the manager and asked for an apology from this checkout operator, to be told he wasn't going to get him to apologise in front of customers and would apologise on his behalf, as I walked out I overheard this checkout operator bragging to another checkout operator what he'd just done, in front of customers!How on earth Aldi wins so many awards each year I'll never know, rude staff, poor quality fresh fruit & veg, long checkout queues.",0,1

And I will get a call or an e-mail to reschedule . and I didn't hear from nobody.

Aldi UK,Nightmare trying to repair/return faulty TV,"I purchased a 40"" TV in Feb 2015. in early October the TV started to take 15 - 20 mins to switch on. I contacted tempo as per the instructions on the BAUHN website. what a nightmare - over 20 mins on hold if they even answer the call. if you leave your number for a call back you still don't get a call back. 2 weeks of trying to sort it out I only got a action when I advised they had until COB the next day to contact me before I would be contacting the Dept of Fair Trading. this didn't end my nightmare. I had an Aldi repairer ordering a part and arranging a pick up while Tempo were saying ""no"" it had to be refunded. another week to get that organized. they use Allied Express couriers to pick up the goods apparently between 2 - 5 pm in the next 2 days. they turned up on the next day at 11 am while we were packaging the item and refused to wait but said they would return the next day ...... they didn't. I called Tempo who asked me to call Allied Express as that would be quicker. I did and still no pick up. when I called back they didn't even bother to book it in! I was so NOT happy and let them know it. I don't want empty apologies for this level of continued incompetence. Just do the right thing. Finally day 4 the TV gets picked up. I follow it up with a call to Tempo as the courier didn't leave anything to acknowledge the pick up. They said they could see it was and they would process the refund ""shortly"" and I should expect it in the next 1.5 weeks. Given this has taken nearly 4 weeks to get to this point I don't I believe anything they say. I have asked for an email to acknowledge the pick up and processing of the refund. I'll wait to see how quickly that comes through.I have told all my friends and colleagues about this horrific experience. My advice is carry the item to an Aldi store and insist they take it back there!A very dissatisfied customer.",0,1
Aldi UK,extremely unsatisfactory shopping experience at aldi tamworth,"My sister went to buy food shopping and fireworks and asked me to come in to the shop to help her with the bags. When at the till the cashier refused to let her buy them, even thought my sister is 30 and had valid ID with her, because i didnt have any on me. I tried to explain that i wasnt purchasing the fireworks that my sister was. But she still refused and used the example that if i had ID and came to buy them with my young daughter i still could not purchase them due to my daughter not being old enough. You can clearly tell i am not 18 i am nearly 30 yet she was very rude and obstinate. This was tamworth aldi. Certainly will not be shopping there again.",0,1
Aldi UK,Employee of aldi,As an employee if Aldi I think we can take quite a lot of abuse. We work really hard and ling hours. The reason behind packing at the packing bench is due to saving us all money if we go slow we would need more staff which costs more money so the food prices would go up and wed be like the rest of the stores. There can be some grumpy workers but that is the case in all shops. I have got to know most of our regulars through chatting at the till. Aldi is a great store that has given alot of news jobs and great careers to alot if people. As for scanning quickly for the elderly we are supposed to use a discression. Most of the time i scan the items.stack them up and pop them in the trolley myself. We all work hare and there to earn money for our familys like everyone else does everyone can be abit grumpy from time to time but everyone i know who works at aldi are happy and cheery. And if there is a big queue ask them to open another if your past the belt anyway.,0,5
Aldi UK,Unavailable special deals stock,"On the day of the special deals offer, I visited the store at 10am to pick up a Dyson DC30 for £100. It turns out they didn't have any stock and one stock assistant said he didn't see any of these arrive in the morning delivery even though it was listed in their special deals catalogue. There were other special deal items also unavailable. Sounds like a ploy to get customers in the store and spend elsewhere. Very disappointed with Aldi!",0,1
Aldi UK,Portishead ..Rude staff... telling me to shop in Waitrose on day 2 of their opening,"Excited by the idea of ""another"" supermarket in Portishead, on day 2 of opening myself, sister in law, friend and children went to the store. The store is pretty standard to any Aldi and was nice to see lots of stock, sadly this impression of a new store was ruined at the counter. HELEN was my assistant, when I simply asked do you get a bonus if you get the shopping through quickly while she was throwing the items at me, she advised me ""the reason why we are cheap here is because you are expected to bag up at your car, this is how the store remains cheaper and that if we don't want to be rushed like this and want to pack at the till we should in fact go to Waitrose""!!! To say this was rude was an understatement.. i explained shopping anywhere with my 2 children was hard so I would continue packing at the till. She then moved on to say ""this is our policy, we won't stay cheap if not and if I am unhappy to speak to someone"" the attitude was terrible and the encouragement to shop else where was awful. I don't shop on price but on product and half decent service, so the fact she was making out I needed it cheap was frankly rude and condescending. Myself and friends will not return and will consider the Sainsburys, lidls or even Waitrose as your staff so rudely encouraged. She and you as a company should be ashamed.",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi is fantastic in the USA,"After reading the majority of reviews, it appears a LOT of them are from Europe/England. Sorry about your bad experiences; however, I have shopped at Aldi in the US for MANY years and the stores are always clean, the staff are very friendly, the prices can't be beat, and the quality is superb.My mother, who does not have an Aldi in California, stocks up her motorhome when she comes to Missouri to visit and takes many products home with her. I absolutely LOVE Aldi.",0,5
Aldi UK,Rude employee,"One of items I tried to,purchase was a partial bag of bananas, did not know they only sell full bags, employee threw bananas in a cart and rudely stated we do not sell partial bags like other grocery stores, now we have to throw these away , did not even ask if I wanted to get a full bag, even when I stated that I needed bananas. Called to complain and was told they would send a gift card. I never received it,called again and again and was told two were sent. They lie about sending or have a thief in their store. The store was a new one on 150 and S. Dixie in Miami, Fl. Told them to send return receipt requested so they know I receive it, they would not, so apparently they lied about sending.",0,1

Aldi UK,bad food. bedford/luton/biggleswade,I have shopped at aldi a few times in my life. Everytime I have been I have selected a product looked at the dates to see which one is longest to last and every time I find food that is out of date. And a few times I have brought a few items that I didn't realise were out of date until I was home and was packing the food away. I think this is disgusting and the staff need to do there job and check dates on the food and actually take food off the shelvs that are off before they restock the shelf. NOT GOOD. other than that it is cheap in there and good only when you get food kr see food in date. In all Bedfordshire stores!,0,1

Aldi UK,Appalling Customer Service,"2 days ago I lost my baby. I am still going through the miscarriage, bleeding and in pain. Not to mention the emotional aspect of things. I went into Aldi in Selby between 15:00-15:30 today. I was in world of my own, consumed with the loss of my 1st child. I paid for my items, and as I was leaving the checkout, the assistant said to the customer who was behind me, ""She needs to cheer up doesn't she"" Thank you Aldi for making this experience even worse for me. Your staff should not comment on customers they know absolutely nothing about.",0,1
Aldi UK,Disgusting customer services. Stevenage,"Personally I don't use Aldi due to poor customer service in the past, but my mum being on a tight pension insisted. So took her she only had about 15 items and is quicker and spritlelier than most 20 year olds. Checkout no greeting, smile or eye contact. Guy starts throwing items through, mum keeps up but then gets a bit behind. Mum wants to keep her independence so if I start packing with her she thinks people are undermining her. So I gently say to mum don't panic mum. The checkout guy then stares at me and says"" YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME "" trying not to embarrass mum I say no not at all. At this point he starts throwing items quicker and whilst still throwing shouts loudly ""CASH or CARD"" at mum. I said "" can you hang on for a minute, she's still packing"" He starts being very confrontational and shouting ""you want to say something to me you looked like you wanted to"" "" Speak to my manger if you have"" I asked him to stop as this was obviously distressing my mum who only lost her husband of 53 years a month ago and just wanted a quiet shopping trip. He again took offence at this and said "" you don't tell me to stop"" and starts shouting for his manager. Manager gets off another till and comes over I explained to her whilst trying to stay calm so as not to embarrass mum further. She was OK but said"" well you can take your basket through"" Thats fine if your holding up the queue but mum wasn't and if people have been shopping in a way for 60 years it is very difficult to re-program people at 76. I said (as I used to be a mystery shopper for ALdi)"" staff are supposed to adjust the checking to the speed of the customer and slow down if they are struggling"". She confirmed this but then said "" I have to get back to my till I'll speak to him later"". Whilst she was talking the guy kept shouting over her. I rang complaints today who offered a voucher. My mum who has shopped here for a while has now refused totally to ever go there agin so what use is a voucher. I get that they are a budget store, but come on a smile is free. The pay is not bad I am an area manager for a vulnerable people and get shouted at and abused every day, I still manage to smile and be polite even if at times I have to go into a corner to scream and don't earn much more. A smile is free. Mum is lucky she's got familly for some people that could be the only person they interact with TRY to make it a pleasnt at least bearable experience.I would rather pay the extra to take mum elsewhere than see her upset like that again.",0,1
Aldi UK,Bad customer service,"I always shop in aldi but just recently am frequently disappointed with the quality of their fresh fruit and veg. I purchased a multi pack of onions and also garlic bulbs when I got them home I cut into the onion and was full of mould. ( this sometimes happens no matter where you buy veg ) thought oh well. Moved on to the garlic..mouldy! Phoned customer services to be told to take the packaging in on my next shop for a refund. Couldn't be bothered with the faff to be honest. I have noticed that a lot of their veg doesn't have use by dates on either..mushrooms, lettuce etc? Also wanted to buy a swede recently buy all were incredibly soft! And to top it off was cooking my children fish fingers when I noticed something poking out the side of one. Went to pull it out thinking it was a bone and it was a 4 cm long piece of curly plastic!! Once again customer services said to take packaging back for a refund! Other supermarkets like tesco or asda would have sent a complimentary gift voucher for at least £5 for the inconvenience! Aldi you are going down in my estimation!",0,2
Aldi UK,Dreadful business practise.,"Aldi advertised in the press Windows 10 laptop available from Thursday 27th August, local store opens at 8am, arrived at 8.02am and the store had sold out, apparently they received 4 units and they never even made it to the sales floor - disgraceful.",0,1
Aldi UK,There are so many reasons Aldi has won supermarket of the year 3 yrs in a row,"Cant believe these moaners - aldi has better meat, better veg (both with far more taste) and great weirdy offers for a fraction of the cost of the big 3 supermarkets. I prefer packing at the station with no one behind glowering at me to hurry up, I can take my time. What a very stupid complaint. And as for the carrier bags - who in this world doeesnt have half a dozen 'worthy' hessian reusable carrier bags these days? Stop clogging up the planet with your plastic sacks, do a tiny bit of planning ahead (i.e. dont leave your worthy bags in the car!) and save yourself a fortune whilst eating food with a darn site more flavour by shopping at Aldi :)",0,5
Aldi UK,WAKE UP ALDI,"I have been a fan of Aldi for years; my workshop is full of their power and air tools. We currently have 6 of their TV’s and the 3 year warranty on products is brilliant and can’t fault the service when needed. 42” TV bought in 2007 needed repair when just in guarantee, also their pressure washer that was 2 yr 11 months old when it expired resulted in a full refund. Try to get that from Curry/Argos type companies that only offer a 1 yr guarantee even though under EU law they are obliged to provide a 2 yr guarantee.However and I hope Aldi take notice of this, it has been all downhill in 2015. My first purchase was a small TV, it stopped working in weeks. I waited until they had pressure washers on sale, it lasted until its second use, leaking internally and hunting (2 days).My latest purchase was 2 sets of solar rock lights for the garden, so disappointing, 3 have given up. It would help if outdoor lights were waterproof. Unfortunately I have lost the receipt for them; they didn’t last 3 months let alone 3 years. The TV and lights where made in China, not sure about the pressure washer.Until this year their products impressed me, now, Lidl look the front runner. I have the choice of 2 within a quarter of a mile, wake up and smell the coffee Aldi",0,3
Aldi UK,"Cheap shop, dumb rules","My regular shop is asda but I have started to go to Aldi a bit more often for some things because they are cheap. Actually I normally end up going to 2 shops because Aldi don't have what I need. Anyway, the stuff is cheap but the checkout experience sucks. I think every time I have been I have been annoyed by it and this time was the worst. For a start you have to pay 5p for a carrier bag even if you dont use it. You are supposed to judge how many carriers you will need.Secondly they expect you to chuck everything in your trolley and move to a packing station. Lol, stuff that I'm not packing twice.I ended up arguing with the checkout girl who insisted it was company policy (because the til area isn't very big.... ) well that's not my fault. Any way Aldi annoy me but they are cheap but I would avoid at all costs a big shop there.",0,2
Aldi UK,"Superb, basic, but superb","As long as you are aware Aldi is a low-cost, low-staffing level supermarket, you should have a great, bank-manager happy experience!! The range of products at our local Worcester store is fine, the staff are lovely, and the specials often give us an extra bargain. Our average monthly shopping bill has dropped from £220 (mostly at Tesco's) to £120 at Aldi. It's a no-brainer. To all the hard-working staff at Aldi Worcester, a GREAT BIG THANK-YOU. I hope your head office recognise your efforts in some way. Julian",0,5
Aldi UK,Worst Customer Service Ever,"I go to ALDI from time to time as the food is cheap and I live near by the store.Today I did small shopping and payed with £5 The staff member on till did not accept my money as he did not recognized the £5 note. It appeared to be an old £5 note. Everything would be fine and I would take this money to my bank to exchange, but the exact £5 note I received from the same shop as change a couple days before. Back then the lady on till said it was Scottish note. I was in a hurry and the note looked almost brand new, so I did accept it. I tried to explain this to the cashier and later the manager who was also called, but they did not listen and demanded another note. I am really disappointed and upset by their attitude and lack of basic customer service.",0,2
Aldi UK,Beware - You may not get what you order,"Having recently uploaded 250 photos and ordered 6""x4"" prints I was surprised to then receive prints measuring 5 1/4""x4"" prints. Even the invoice claimed I had been sent 6""x4"". When questioned why, I was told that I should have read the FAQs first and that with digital prints not having an aspect ratio of 3:2 I had to resized them all before uploading. In all my years of getting digital photos printed I have never had to do this and the photo editing software has always been sophisticated enough to resize and produce the ordered print size. Be careful if using the service, you may think you're ordering a print size that Aldi then don't deliver.To top it all, having written a letter of complaint Aldi have not even had the courtesy to acknowledge and respond. Absolutely appalling customer service.",0,1
Aldi UK,East Prescott road,The staff member I recall called Julie I regularly see in East Prescott store is one off a kind.. Av never see some one work so hard an well parented then this young lady .. The respect around and at the tills this young lady gives is out standing ..

Aldi UK,Aldi 3 year electrical warranty,"I bought a 1500w SDS Rotary Hammer Drill over 2 years ago and have used it quite a bit since (it's brilliant). The last time I tried to use it there was a bit of a problem with the hammer action. I emailed the relevant address with a copy of my receipt. Blow me, 2 days later a brand new one (newer model) arrived on my doorstep! No questions asked & I wasn't even asked to return the old one. So now I have extra chisels, chuck etc. I am very impressed to say the least. Outstanding customer service from Aldi - many thanks indeed.",0,5
Aldi UK,Tooky Money Kept My Shopping,"Following on from my previous review, I have still not received my money back from Aldi despite waiting the 3 working days they said it would take. It beggars belief that, in these days of modern technology they have failed to return my cash. I contacted my bank today, who advised me that the transaction wasn't declined and they sent Aldi the authorisation code required to complete the transaction, on 31st July but they have failed to do anything. I can only assume that, following my complaint they have decided not to bother completing my transaction in order to avoid apologising for their monumental error. Come on Aldi get your act together before you lose ALL of your customers!",0,1
Aldi UK,Total disappointment!,"Terrible experience , rushed and pushed all food in trolley because is cheap? Customer service nonexistent I was a customer not enemies. Felt like cattle.",0,1
Aldi UK,not bad,"Aldi is fine if you are someone who buys a lot of branded products as they sell similar products at way cheaper prices, however if you are someone like me who buys a lot of supermarkets smart price items you will not make any savings as these items tend to be much cheaper than aldis products, I do however like aldi for its washing powder, this I find is really good and much cheaper than the big brands, I also like the bleach, the washing up liquid and facial wipes, also the special buy items, especially home ware items can be pretty good",0,3
Aldi UK,Half the price of Tescos,"Moved my shopping to Aldi last year and saved £60 per week, you won't find all the premium brands but the Aldi versions taste almost identical but without the price tag, to be honest it is harder to park and it is very busy but that's what happens when your shopping is half the price of Tescos, if you want easy parking and premium brands then stick with Tesco / Sainsbury etc but if, like me you enjoy saving money then Aldi is the right place for you especially when they do the £5 off £40 spend.... Good job Aldi keep it up.",0,5
Aldi UK,Customer Service - the worst  in shop  experience and Aldi HQ are no better,"I went to a local Aldi store (Gloucester) and found the shop smelt of BBQ fluid and the fumes made me feel sick. Had to wait ages in the queue for the single till in order to pay - and the operator was buzzing multiple times for assistance to no avail. Then to be advised to improve speed and efficiency I should pack in the packing bay (speed and efficiency having spent ages in the queue?) . I had my bags ready and opened in the trolley - and it was not a huge shop. I complained to HQ and basically Customer Service just gave me the corporate response but did not express any understanding of why this was such a poor shopping experience. They insisted they were efficient and of course having just one till open keeps the staff costs down, even if that means customers waiting in a queue for 15 to 20 minutes. Shocking response. The manager at the Gloucester could not even be bothered to respond to my complaint. My advice is to go elsewhere - I certainly will not be spending my hard earned cash in a shop that really has no respect for customers.",0,1
Aldi UK,Poor service and long queues,Endless queues at the checkout - ideal shop for those who have nothing else to do with their days. Visited the local stores twice and always the same thing - loads of people waiting to pay with trollies full of unbranded items. I left my basket at the end of the line and walked out on both occasions. These continental firms need to take some lessons from Tesco in customer service.,0,1
Aldi UK,Coronita - not in Scotland though,"Was excited about finally being able to buy a pack of Coronita beers today - have only ever been able to get the 210ml size in the U.S. But, when I turned up at the Stirling Aldi store today (16/7/15) to pick up a pack as part of their special promotion I was told they didn't have any...and that I should 'come back tomorrow - they might be on then'.Called customer services only to (eventually) be told that Coronita beer is not available in Scotland - why not? No one can tell me.Got a call back from customer services to say 'sorry' - asked if I could buy a pack over the phone. Response: ' no, we can't take payments over the phone'It's a great 'sales prevention system' you've got there Aldi - congratulations.Utterly dreadful.",0,1
Aldi UK,Rotten Fruit And Veg Amongst Other things,"I bought some onions from Aldi today.Out of the 7 onions, 4 were rotten with one being so bad that I put my finger through it.This is not the first time either.In the past we have had a rotten cauliflower, well ropey green beans and carrots that had to be thrown because the smell was so bad upon opening.And the meat has gone downhill as well.We have given up on buying bacon and sausages as the amount of water in them is terrible. The chicken doesn't fare any better.And good luck finding a half decent steak. You might find one or two out of the 20 boxes they have on the shelf.ANd their washing up liquid has been thinned out as well. I believe that they've had to change the Good Housekeeping recommendation badge on the bottle to just 'approved'.A warning to you Aldi .......... YOU WILL GET FOUND OUT.",0,1
Aldi UK,Scanning Scam!,"Beware of this when visiting Aldi, Llangefni. Whilst checking out the cashier swiped and item twice, I'd originally thought it strange as I'd heard the ping twice, she then touched the screen, I'd assumed that it was to cancel the double swipe, however, when I got home there it was two items at 99p when I'd only got one. Quite a slick way to make a bit of extra money for the company, I didn't go back as I'm staying on the island of Anglesey on holiday and it would probably cost that in petrol. However they should be able to check the CCTV for evidence. I'll be checking my receipt like a hawk from now on in Aldi, no matter how many people are in the queue.",0,3
Aldi UK,Very bad meat and fish products!!!!,"I used to really like aldi, thought they were brill. Finally something has put a spanner in the works the larger chain supermarkets, such as tesco, that had the food monopoly and kept increasing prices at an eye watering rate. It seemed at one point they would literally take over the world. I started shopping at aldi and the prices were incredible and the food was good, really good. But over the past few months things have gone downhill drastically. Nearly half of the meat products I buy were bad. Chicken thighs that looked good in the packaging but open it up and on the underside were bad and smelled rancid. Again with, a supposedly rump steak. Nice lean cut it seemed when I picked it up. Look underneath and that is where all the fat and gristle is hiding.Last two packets of fish I have opening and they have been rancid, literally was nearly sick or was that bad. It puts me to tears to throw such expensive items, like this fish away. You could see the rotten parts. Last fish was for a fish pie and still had 5 more days left until the sell by date. It's a disgrace and I'm so unhappy with them!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Foul,I purchased British Beef in Drambuie Sauce with Dumplings today ... The blurb on package was awesome 'Choice cuts cooked until tender with fluffy dumplings' I can honestly say it was so awful it went straight into the bin!!! The meat was so sinewy and tough with the most disgustingly textured dumplings !!! The sauce was the only redeeming feature of this dish .. I will never buy this again !! NOt fit even for the dog !!!,0,1

Aldi UK,Poor customer care,Good products at decent prices but total lack of customer care. Staff seem more concerned with their clocking off times than providing customer satisfaction,0,2
Aldi UK,"Good stock, shame about the staff","Every time I go in my local Aldi (Whitehaven) I find myself getting annoyed at the staff who constantly chew gum - all till staff one day; staff who have multiple horrible (IMO) piercings and tattoos and the shelf-stocking staff who throw bags of produce on top of the rest when stocking up shelves - eg apples, potatoes, bananas, all of which bruise..... and more.... And this is saying nothing of the massive queues that develop at tills. It often takes longer to queue and pay than to collect your items. The bell might be rung but it can be 5 mins before a team member appears.... and another 3-4 people have joined each queue... It would help if staff did not allow customers to pack their bags at the tills - but they never enforce the rule. Why do I go? The produce is good quality and fairly priced.",0,3
Aldi UK,Store Assistant,"I work at Aldi. I've read some of the reviews and I really wonder why people say 'I'm never shopping there again' after a bad expierence with ONE member of staff. 99% of the time people compliment our customer service and our hard work.Also, we ask you to pack at the bench, so we can get customers through quicker and close our tills faster whilst maintaining minimal que length. This allows us to carry on with other jobs ie. Carding, putting stock out, tidying... If we did not do this we would have to hire more staff and therefore prices would go up. Aslong as you have a positive attitude, you work hard and make the best of your job, Aldi is brilliant to work for.",0,5

Aldi UK,Not Good,"I recently bought 2 sets of wood bits for a very reasonable price. I used one the other day and I noticed was not sharp, then the metal simply just twisted and bent - it was useless. What is the point selling something like this. I wonder how many other things they sell are rubbish.",0,1
Aldi UK,Pretty good,"All the stuff I buy that i can compare to brands is pretty acceptable due the the prices.Vegetable presentation and condition in some of their stores can be a bit off putting but still cheap.Location of some stores a bit harder to get to, some less so.In my local one in Melksham in Wiltshire, I think is the best one, don't really see many problems with it.Also they have a good rotation of different products (branded and non branded)",0,4
Aldi UK,poor staff attitude,"Newton Aycliffe store is ok for parking (unless you stay longer than 90 mins) can't imagine why you would but once inside the staff attitude is very intimidating.The brushing up operative is on a mission to use the biggest brush available at the busiest times and should you dare to get in their way you get brushed up with it, shelf stackers take priorities over any customers and the appearance of most staff is disheveled at best.When you get to the check outs that's when the real lack of customer service or ( intimidation) kicks in, try packing at the till if you dare, even worse try to use a voucher or coupons, it's as if you have tried to steal the stuff.Why they insist on shouting ""Cash or Card"" as they near the completion of scanning feels like they shout "" Stand and deliver"".Tonight popped in for a couple of bits, only came to £3 odd, ""Stand & deliver"" opted for cash and tended a fiver.Change was thrust into my hand as I hurriedly tried to stash a couple of yougurts in the bag before getting a dirty look (like a game on the cube), anyway I get near the door and look at my change, only about60p , I return to the smug intimidating youth who is now bullying another customer and say I think my change is wrong.Apologies? No chance, and as he gives me the rest of my change has the nerve to make some comments about me not saying thanks,,, Oh yeah that's right I should thank you for robbing me, sorry.",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi trolleys,"Went to Aldi Lincoln today had my bank card but no cash, but when I arrived I realised that I had no coins for the trolley, so I asked a member of staff to release me trolley and he replied he can't, but go and buy an item and get a pound cash back which I find unreasonable as other supermarkets will release a trolley without going though such a rigmarole.Lidl keeps trolley coins at there tills, so Aldi should take a leaf out other stores books.",0,1
Aldi UK,Needs improvement,"Review based on Selby store. N York'sFor some time now I have boycotted Tesco for Aldi, their products are fantastic, cheap and the local store is easier to get to than surrounding supermarkets. However I have found myself starting to use Tesco again more and more frequently, and unless things resolve will become permanent.Product selection can be a problem, and I accepted that I would still need another shop. However being organised got around any problems there so isn't a major issue.The real problem is queue times and the the state of the store!The Selby store I frequent is just always so busy in terms of queues. Very rarely are all of the tills open and people queue to the point where isles are blocked and people abandon their shopping. A busy store with just one or two tills open isn't acceptable. Especially when some staff just abandon their till because ""It's my break time so get someone else, I'm not staying here!"" (yes you hear them say this!)Also, the amount of times I find I've nearly tripped over rubbish left by staff, or nearly smashed a cup of tea that a staff member has left on top of a fridge is beyond a joke. The manageress (I believe she is) is rude and I have seen her many times scowling at customers whilst muttering under her breathe and barging her way through to get to a shelf with items on with a pallet in tow. Also the shelves are a mess, with items strewn everywhere, in the wrong places and littered with rubbish / empty crates and boxes (and even on one occasion a packing knife!)Perhaps 4 or 5 of the staff (that seem to have been there long term) are fantastic, friendly, polite and seem to organise things between themselves. And others don't seem to give a damn and even talk about other customers in front of you in an un-polite way and complain about the duties they have been given! There seems a definite divide in staff who have the general well being of the store and customer in mind, and the ones that just think the working day is a democracy.If they wish for people to shop there, then the store needs to return to it's former customer oriented glory rather than what seems now to be a whatever suits the staff best affair.Also, arriving in the store with no baskets to use because no body could be bothered to recover any from the tills isn't a good start to your shopping experience!I would say they are under staffed, but to be honest I think it seems more like the staff are not managed properly and also seems like a bit of a free for all where some staff members just do what they want and huff and puff about it.I really do like what Aldi was (at least the Selby branch) and would love for it to return to this. As it is now, if I hadn't had previous good experiences I would never shop there again. I think action needs to be taken before Aldi are a victim of their own success.One last thing...Your curry pot noodles (own brand) were fantastic, but then you changed the recipe. They are now awful and tasteless. Why do this?? :) They were always hard to find stocked because of popularity, where as now they are in abundance. So surely this must have been noticed?",0,3
Aldi UK,"Shop at Aldi somercotes store 4/ 5 times weekly, love the freindly check out staff.","Love Aldi they sell most of my regular shopping items at prices mostly lower than other supermarkets. Particularly the fresh fruit and veg. Staff are always friendly and chatty at checkout. They are incredibly hard working staff, you never see them not working, even when having the odd chat with each other. My only complaint is my local store gets too busy at times and needs to be bigger. This is being addressed as planning permission has been given to extend it again!",0,5
Aldi UK,worst customer  service don't shop here,The worst customer service by the cashier rudely asked me to put my shopping back in basket. Had a full blown confrontation with me.

Aldi UK,Customer Service!!!!!,"This has to be the WORST shopping experience I have had to date! My local Aldi is 25 miles away. A bit of a trek for shopping, but with all the recent adverts I thought I would check this out for myself, plus there were several shops in the area, therefore it would not have been a ""one shop wonder""WELL!!NEVER AGAIN, there was not any choice for a vegetarian but this was the least of my concerns.Water spillage on the floor which had not been cleaned up and a sign sitting in the puddle for customers to be careful! The water was a large spillage and had spread across the floor. I decided to back track down an aisle to continue my shopping. I now wish I had left the shop at this point. I knew that Aldi is in the same league as Lidl and in my opinion is very hit and miss with choice and availability. For my first visit to this shop, I was not impressed and the staff at the checkout was extremely rude! Politeness cost's nothing and I found her tone and attitude was abrupt, to the point I was going to walk out and leave my shopping on the conveyor belt!It is not common knowledge that you are expected to reload your trolley and pack your goods after you have left the checkout and pack separately at the shopping table. When I told the cashier that I had not shopped at Aldi before, she quickly changed her tune and was eager for me to write a review on the Aldi website and find out about further special offers. This was only accessible if you sign with via your facebook account!Well here is my review!Don't bother shopping there!The money you think you would save, you will spend on hot footing it to the next supermarket as there is very little choice! As I unpacked my shopping I found that many of the potatoes were rotten in the bag. Health and safety would have a field day. To top it off there is not even a smile or thank you for choosing Aldi but a sour faced checkout assistant whom would rather not be at work! She should be lucky and thankful she has a job!",0,1
Aldi UK,Really gone downhill,"I go to Aldi at Market Street in Mancheser. When the store first opened it was great, 6 tills which used to really be effective at getting long queues down. Unfortunately, they have changed the system to 'Go to till 5, go to till 13' etc replacing the old tills with stand up ones. Every time I go in this store, there are roughly 50 people waiting to be served, stock thrown everywhere where people will (rightly) not wait for a ridiculous time. With the long conveyor belt tills, the lines really used to move quickly. Unfortunately now people are spending too much time dawdling, packing before paying and the store is getting that you can't even get down the aisles. I and many others are now returning to Tesco - SHAME....",0,2
Aldi UK,spoiled produce,"My wife went to Aldi yesterday for asparagus and bananas, she got to check out and noted the bananas peels were split and turning brown. Cashier replaced items. Today we opened the asparagus and found it too was spoiled. At Walmart the asparagus is not wrapped, so you can see and smell the product. Will never shop Aldi again, no bargain if the food will make a person sick.",0,1
Aldi UK,Cheaper at Aldi BUT only if you pay once for the goods,"Four times last year I was double charged on goods swiped twice going through the tills. complained to the Haverhill store manager.Then last week double charged on an item again.Now anyone can expect this to happen occasionally. But what do you think happened this week.......yes Double charged again.If this is what happens to ONE customer. JUST HOW OFTEN IS IT HAPPENING TO OTHERS ? 1in 10 customers getting charged twice , or more even?And over how many stores? Now careless or what. one customer in two trips getting charged twice. You way up the odds on that.I was told I could return the till receipt to the store and get refunded...I'm sure they would prefer to do that than pay to change their methods.It's only going to cost a few coppers to them for each customer who does notice and is bothered to make a complaint. Aldi say they like the way the tills are set up, means a faster turn round at the till and less waiting time. So do you want to be charged TWICE quickly, so they can throw the goods at you and get the next one in?Switch to Aldi..... yea the goods might be cheaper if you pay once HUH!Bob",0,1
Aldi UK,Would'nt bother returning,Decided to purchase a few items from Aldi at the Altona North Shopping Centre earlier today but after my experience with the unsmiling and unfriendly woman at the checkout I wouldn't set foot in the place again even if i saved 50% At least the staff at the local duopoly being Coles & Woolworths manage to to at least say a simple thank you and more often than not is accompanied by a courteous smile.,0,1

Whilst this is happening the ""security guard"" is watching and doing nothing, do they only move if Aldi food is being thieved?

I've also saved loads of money by shopping here.",0,5
Aldi UK,What do people expect?,"Honestly, I think people are expecting far too much from what is a value store. In my experience of our local Falkirk store , staff are always polite and helpful despite being understaffed for the workload they have. Packing is designed to be quick and you're provided with a packing area to do so at your leisure. This is by no means a new concept, shops like lidl do this and going back nearly forty years a shop called Shoppers Paradise did likewise. To compensate for this inconvenience you are sold quality produce at very reasonable prices. This is a trade off which I and millions like me are willing to accept. I've never had a bad experience and they're special offers are excellent.",0,5
Aldi UK,NEVER SHOP IN ALDI,I went first time today in the Bordesley green branch in Birmingham.

Aldi UK,Infringement of Statutory Rights; Bollard Damage to Person & Vehicle,"Aldi really is 'The Unacceptable Face of Capitalism'. I was harassed to buy a newspaper when merely browsing the display, not obstructing customers or sales. Also had an earlier issue with their sharp (frankly dangerous) parking bollards which are razor-sharp pebble-dash set in concrete: guaranteed to mark your clothing and damage your vehicle. Cambridge City Council recently had to warn them about failed lighting throughout their car park which occasioned bollard scratches. I suggested to management they place rubber collars over their bollards, possibly with some marketing information. They declined.",0,1

Thats the orders we have and the pressure we are under to meet their speed limit. If we dont then we get told of. Aldi as a supermarket is very cheep and very good for quality of products. The cashiers seemed to be judged by the customers all the time. Aldi as an employer is back another century where slavery exists and workers have no rights. The Managers treat you like s*** on a daily basis and you made to work like a donkey. You might say why I am still there then? Well currently applying for other jobs so fingers crossed",0,2
Aldi UK,Out of stock! They do not order enough sale items.,"I like like their products and the prices are fair but they advertise many things that are not available when you go to the store to buy them. Therefore you are wasting your time and gas money. This is not fair and happens all the time. They do not give out rain checks either.You cannot call the store, and you cannot call the corporation and ask if the item is available because they cannot get through to anyone in the store, and they tell you,"" the store must be very busy because no one is answering"".

I have been using my local store on Beverley Road in Hull for over 5 years and had noticed the very scant regard for customers from one of the security people. This man was eventually replaced by another who, along with some of the minions on the tills, actually tried to search me. They were abusive and threatening. The manager was called and she turned out to be even worse. I know that this was near Xmas but a few of them also stank of booze. I lodged an official complaint and was rewarded with a measly £10.00 voucher. Never again will I shop there.",0,1

Not only are we consistently impressed with the quality of most of their products - especially the ground coffee and mature cheddar, but the checkouts are super-fast, and the staff helpful and friendly. I checked out Morrisons last week as I was in the area and was not impressed with the prices. Maybe their branded junk food was cheaper, I don't know; but for cheese, meat and produce, Morrisons could not compete on price or quality.",0,5
Aldi UK,Packing Nightmare!,"In response to no reply at customer services;Sorry ALDIBut I am quite well aware of your unpleasant policy for what you consider to be the best way for shoppers to pack. Obviously you have never been into one of your own stores & bought over £100 of groceries only to find that you have to unload and reload not once but twice, firstly at a ridiculous speed which staff are encourage to do, only to find your carefully grouped items have then become completely muddled-some even damaged. These then have to been bagged up after all of them are removed from the trolley & put on the side. Who is watching/ holding my handbag while I do this?How many customers will find room to do this if they all followed your recommendation? During this ordeal we are expected to check our receipt for mistakes - and yes, staff make plenty, due to the silly speed they are told work at! You still have not answered the question of how this saves US time? Do you REALLY think this is what we want? Do you REALLY think that we mind waiting for the customer ahead of us to pack their purchases away properly if we know we will be afforded the same courtesy??If your company really wants to give the 'big boys' a run for their money this is one area you would do well in copying their practise -treating your higher spenders with the service they pay for- not hustling them through like you don't give a damn!",0,1

The customer service that I personally have recieved has always been outstanding, with friendly staff always willing to have a chat with you, or help you out in one way or another. After shopping here for a month I now can't imagine shopping anywhere else!",0,5
Aldi UK,False advertising,Every time they have a sell on something I go on the day they are selling the product an it is never there for example went for the sell on deep fryers an they didn't have them been back there several time still no deep fryers I asked when are they getting them the reply was when ever they come in I'm so mad never have what they say in the paper false advertising an will not be back I swear they do it so you will keep coming back an buy something else false advertising!!!!!!!!!!Else,0,1

Aldi UK,Cashier Constantly Throwing Shopping at me,"We recently did a large shop in Chelmsford Aldi and all OK up to checkout, The cashier literally threw the items through and at me, so much so that 3 items went on the floor, it being impossible to remove them quickly enough, so on completion, being quite incensed, I told the girl she could now pick the items off the floor or keep it all, which she did then pick the items up not saying a word. I understand the policy but cant believe any significant time is saved and anyway I have found such method extremely off putting using Aldi and this shows constantly in other review comments and talking to other people. In the past we have only bought odd bits in Aldi and have found that while their prices are mostly keen and some good quality, a lot is either very poor quality or mediocre at best.",0,1
Aldi UK,Rude and unhelpful HQ Customer Service,"I had a legitimate problem with an unwarranted £70 charge for parking at Aldi for 35 minutes on a 90 minute free car park of theirs. So I called Customer Service at their HQ. I have always found that a softly softly approach results in a simple solution to problems. Not so with Aldi, their CSR was aggressive to the point of rudeness and simply refused any help saying it wasn't an Aldi problem even though it was an alledged Aldi contractor who created the problem. I continued to be reasonable until it struck me this woman really didn't want to be there and certainly didn't want to help customers. So I bit back good and hard and the change in attitude was instant, suddenly she couldn't do enough although by this time Aldi had lost me as a customer for life. So take extreme care when parking at Aldi as they send out random demands for £70 to customers without justification. Always keep your receipts as proof of shopping there. But most importantly don't expect Aldi to believe you even with their sales receipt as proof. They will try to do absolutely nothing and abandon you if you have a problem. I don't know of any other supermarket that treats its customers this way so shop anywhere but Aldi to be safe. If you do use them and have problems never ever contact their CSR's at HQ, go to the store. My advice to ALDI is to close your HQ Customer Service before they ruin your relationship with your customer base because Aldi customers are seen as the enemy at your published point of contact.",0,1
Aldi UK,Had to pick my shopping up off the floor!,"Shopped here all of the time, no problems! Last week was very different! This new cashier threw my shopping at me, half of it ended up on the floor, she overcharged me (noticed when I got home)...I was disgusted! Emailed customer service and got a lukewarm apology, have decided I would rather pay more for my shopping and actually buy some good food, rather than tasteless rubbish, so from now on will be shopping elsewhere. Yes, Aldi, you may be cheap, but that's all you are! You seriously need to learn about customer service and how to treat your customers. Thanks to your lovely cashier at your till, who you forgot to train on how to show a bit of courtesy to customers, you've lost one customer and I think you will lose a lot more at this rate!",0,1
Aldi UK,Very bad customer service from head office who tell blatant lies ( don't buy electrical goods )store staff were brilliant thoe,"I bought a tv from the blackburn store in 2012 the main power switch started to make a noise and spark . So I rung customer service and explained the situation ,, they said find the receipt as proof of purchase and we will repair it , I couldn't find the receipt so got a bank statement , said that's not acceptable ,,,, so rung trading standards they said store has to provide a duplicate rung head office and said trading standards said you have to provide the receipt , they said go in store and they will ,,, any went to store and the staff at blackburn were brilliant Laura the manager spent a long time finding it ( that's why head office don't like you going in store it is short staffed) when I rung back said I'd like a refund they said because you have had it for a while we can only give you a percentage of the cost as had it a while I said ok give me a new tv and il bring that back ,,, silence on the phone she sad ok just this once take it back and we will give you a full refund ,,, you do not have to accept a repair , under the sale of electrical goods act ,, so went to store and got a full refund blackburn staff did all they could but head office were not so polite and honest .",0,1

Aldi UK,appaling,"the delta halogen oven we purchased failed to work after about 5 uses. I returned it to the store, along with the receipt, expecting a full refund, I was very rudely and bluntly informed that Aldi had a 60 day returns policy ( I was not made aware of this at time of purchase) and as we were on day 66 it was'nt their problem. I tried to emphasize the product was faulty, I was not expecting a refund due to a change of mind. The manager kept citing the 60 day policy and told me to take up my complaint with the manufacturer, and the onus was on me to return the item to the manufacture and claim back postage costs. I informed the manager of my consumer rights but he did'nt want to know. I returned the next day with a print out of the sale of goods act 1979 and told him Aldi policy cannot override the law and Aldi should ensure their staff are aware of this. I left with a full refund, however I had the inconvenience and cost of two trips to the store ( approx 45 miles) plus the distress of spending more than half an hour stating my case. I have contacted Aldi but have not received a satisfactory response. I will not shop at Aldi in the future.",0,1
Aldi UK,BEWARE OF LAURA FACE SERUM,After purchasing and using the anti ageing serum I immediately suffered a severe anaphalactic shock due to the product containing Nuts. THERE IS NO WARNING OF NUT CONTENT ON PACKAGING. And the ingredient list is in small print and yellow in colour making it near impossible to see. After contacting ALDI they seem to think this.isn't.important or of interest to them. I in NO way contacted them with financial expectations but to suggest a warning notice on the packaging to prevent this happening to somebody else. I WONDER HAD I NOT HAD.AN EPI PEN AND QUICK THINKING PARTNER AND I HAD DIED THEY MAY ACTUALLY DISPLAY SOME INTEREST OR CONCERN,0,1
Aldi UK,Such a disgrace to the other Aldi's around the world,"I was shocked and flabbergasted by the prices here compared to the Aldi in the Netherlands, it's so extremely expensive!! And they don't even have everything I have to run around between Aldi and Sainsbury all the time.. I bought 12 bottles of still water for two pounds what a rip off. I buy water at Aldi back home 6 for 75 eurocents which is like 58 p so I expected that 12 bottles wouldn't be more than 1.20 pounds. It's an outrage!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Overcharge and no customer empathy,"Popped into Urmston Aldi tonight for a few items, which I got without problem. However, at the checkout, I was overcharged by 20p on cat food (I usually make a point of complaining when this happens but was very tired and cold tonight and really couldn't be bothered). Also, the chap on the checkout virtually THREW my change at me, which resulted in half of it going on the floor. As I have a bad back, I was struggling to pick this up. Luckily there was a lovely little girl in the queue behind me who very obligingly picked up what I couldn't reach, while the cashier sat there looking on. Might be cheap but don't expect anything in the way of customer service. And always check your receipt. Charging a different price at the till to what is marked on the shelf is commonplace at Aldi in my experience. Usually only a small amount so that, very often, people will not even notice, but if they do this to every customer, all those 20p overcharges soon mount up. If you notice, make a point of complaining and demanding they return the overcharge. As they rely on mass turnover, complaints and refunds slow them down.",0,2
Aldi UK,Shoddy attitude from Customer Services (What Customer Services?),"I have just received a lukewarm response of 'Take the packaging to you local store for a refund or replacement' for a disgusting beef pie that we bought. The contents were neither succulent nor, for 50% of it, meat.I had to sit and watch my husband fishing piece after piece of gristle and tubular lumps from out of the gravy. A meal he doesn't want to see again as most of the contents were inedible. To give Aldi the chance of sorting out their suppliers quality control instead of going to trading standards I wrote an email to Consumer Services along with supporting photographs telling them that this was not the first time we've had a pie like this but we had thought ourselves unlucky. I now think it is indicative of the standard of their prepared foods.I had to find something else for my husbands dinner as there was so little of the pie he was prepared to eat. The simple (standard reply, I guess) offhand response only added to the anger, and goes very little towards making me feel as if we are valued as customers. I will be writing to them again except that this time it will be sent higher up.",0,1
Aldi UK,Could do better,"I have been a regular at my local Aldi and to be honest make a saving every time l visit. Aldi would be stupid not to listen to all the noise that customers have been making of late. While it may be brilliant to save everytime one shops, their CUSTOMER SERVICE is shambolic to be honest. Aldi should not sit back just because people are running to their shops trying to save hard earned cash while underestimating the power of the big supermarkets who treat their customers as kings. Aldi will be surprised soon when people will desert them due to poor customer care. Why should l be made to feel that my presence in this shop is no longer required? Everytime l get to the tills that's exactly how l feel. Get out and see you next time, you feel so rushed it's unbelievable. Get a grip on this Aldi or you will soon be surprised!",0,3

Aldi UK,"brilliant,good for vegetarian s.","Love aldi,been shopping here for about ten years,then people use to looked shocked when I said I shopped there,now of course people have realised how they have been ripped off by usual supermarkets for years and with the credit crunch people have been forced to change the way they shop,hence why aldi is now so busy.yes it has limited stock but how many different brands of say beans or tomatoes do I need?I find it so much quicker,because I don't have to think,I know where all the products I use are,that said they are extending ranges all the time. I'm vegetarian and I find loads of stuff I can eat,they now have a meat free section,with nut burgers,mexican bean burgers,we eat loads of veg and because of the cheap prices I can really stock up,same with the tinned beans and chick peas,pastas,gnocchi,noodles,they have also started doing healthy fruit bars and Dr karg type crisp bread and rice cakes,found near the till,I also like the fact that they were one of the first supermarkets to not test any of their household products and toiletries on animals.yes sometimes the customer service can be a bit military style,but that makes me giggle,how quick they put it through the till,and I have noticed that they have more staff,and quality of staff is getting better too, I think aldi is brilliant.",0,5

(we think to hospital).. no ambulance for a head wound?? we not seen him since and we are in most days.

Aldi UK,"I used to love my Aldi Store, but will never return to this parking trap!","I was a very regular and happy customer at Aldi Anerley up until this morning. I have just received a very abrupt final notice letter from their appointed car park management company ""ParkingEye"" telling me that I am being fined for an unspecified offence that apparently occurred in their Anerley store car park on 04/08/2014. This is a free car park for Aldi customers.On the day in question, I drove to the store, parked in a space indicated by the person directing traffic in the car park (as often happens at busy times in the small car park), and then went in to the store and proceeded to spend £118 on food shopping (I have the bank statements to prove it). About an hour later, I came out, loaded my shopping into my car and left without incident. I have not received any of the initial notifications ParkingEye claim to have sent me, about any offence I'm supposed to have committed. I have just been sent a final notice, which STILL does not tell me what I'm supposed to have done. It simply demands that I pay £70. I have absolutely no idea where this fine has come from or what its justification is. I have already submitted an appeal to ParkingEye demanding to know what I am alleged to have done. I have spoken with Aldi customer services number, and they have told me I have to write and post a letter to head office to make a complaint. The main problem with that is that ParkingEye are threatening me with legal action if I don't pay them within 7 days. Writing a letter of complaint to their head office and waiting for a response will surely take much longer than that.They also told me that there are time limits imposed of an hour and a half to stop people parking in the store when they aren't shopping there (Tesco allow 3 hours). That is laughable because the Anerley store is located quite far away from any desirable shops/train stations etc. With nothing attractive within quick walking distance of the store, why would anyone use the car park unless they were shopping there? Regardless of this, I was in the store the entire time and spent £118 (which in Aldi, is an awful lot!). It would seem that your number plate details are snapped as you enter the car park and as you leave. But fails to take into consideration the following: The store has a tiny car park so it takes an age to find a space. They have half of the tills closed even when it's busy so people have to queue for ages. You are then rushed through the check out and then forced to pack the shopping separately afterwards on the counters by the window, which actually takes far longer than if you had been able to pack it as it was being checked out (the way Tesco and Sainsbury's allow you to). It's almost like having to do the checkout process twice. If people are doing a large shop, this can easily take over an hour 1/2 with all of the delays. I was previously happy to overlook all of this, as it still made for good value shopping, but this all prolongs the amount of time you are in the store, so if they are then going to charge you for staying 10 minutes longer in order the navigate the delays that THEY put in your way, I will be shopping elsewhere from now on. I'm failing to see how Aldi can allow this company to simply demand money from customers without telling them what it is they are alleged to have done, and without taking into account things like the accessibility of the store which may lead to people having to take longer to shop. There's also no real way to estimate or quantify any loss incured by Aldi from me staying 10 minutes longer. If anything, my £118 shop was possibly worth more than they would have made from the next person who may have stayed 10 minutes and only spent £5. I'd also like to point out that when I went onto the private property of Aldi, my contract is with them and them only. I have not chosen to enter into any contract with ParkingEye so I don't see how they have any legal authority to enforce anything upon me.I have sent a lengthy email to Matthew Barnes and Roman Heini's secretary making them aware of my intention to take this to Trading Standards. I fully intend to fight this as I believe this to be extremely disproportionate. If it isn't rectified shortly, I will never be shopping in any of their stores again. This is a terrible and grossly unfair way to treat people who come in to their car parks and stores in good faith - Customers BEWARE!",0,1

Aldi UK,"Excellent. Good products, good price, good shopping there.","Great! My favourite shop bar Lidl.However, on a Saturday or Sunday it's now ever so busy due to the popularity. Go early or late, not at lunchtime or there might not be room in the car-park!The food's good, the prices excellent. Get used to the change in ""culture"" - it's cheap because there are fewer staff, and the shelves are stocked in a particular way for efficiency. The range is not hugely wide, again to reduce overheads and make what they do sell cheaper. Most is ""own brand"", and it's good! There are some real bargains, and I estimate that overall my shop is 30% cheaper at Aldi compared to Tesco or Sainsbury's.Please, PLEASE do not pack at the till. This slows everyone down, and it is not the normal practice at Aldi. Put your stuff on the belt, your trolley by the till when it's time, and put the stuff directly into your trolley as it's scanned. Pay, then go to the packing shelf to pack into the bags you purchased or the box you picked up. That way, it's really quick, and there's no queue. Don't like it? Well, it's the normal way Aldi (and Lidl) work, so if it's not to your taste, go elsewhere, please let the rest of us regulars shop fast and cheaply!I'm amazed by some of the comments here. Park for less than the 1 1/2 hour limit, and you won't get a parking fine! Don't shoplift and you won't be questioned!Oh, and if you pick something up and decide you don't want it, PLEASE put it back where it's supposed to be. Just dropping goods on the nearest shelf, or in the freezer, is a nuisance, and wasteful too!One of my favourite shops.",0,4

Aldi UK,"Tried them, didn't like them","I was looking for a new supermarket for my regular shopping because Sainsburys are becoming unaffordable. I tried the new Aldi, Mapperley Top branch. In fairness, some own brand products are good, like a nutty muesli that compares well with the Dorset Cereals version at a fraction of the price. Their free range chickens are also good value, as are their eggs. The downside is that their stock is limited in range, and there will still be things you need to go to bugger supermarkets for. These include what I regard as basics, like turkey mince, fresh fish, and things that may not be necessities but I want anyway, like ice lollies for children. Then there is their wine. Sainsburys have a good selection with some decent offers, and despite being generally cheaper on most products, I found the Aldi wine of average value and certainly average quality. You wouldn't think so to read reviews on their own website, where everything is 5 stars or close to it, but now I know why. I posted quite a favourable review of a wine I tried there, but even that wasn't good enough for them and was removed because it 'didn't meet their standards'. Now, what is the point of inviting customer reviews if you can't handle the truth?The worst thing about Aldi though is having your shopping thrown at you at checkout. I'm relatively fit and can keep pace, but I don't know how the elderly manage and I doubt is Aldi really care. They don't seem to have much respect for their customers. At the moment, they are doing well because people need to save money, but that attitude won't serve them well in the long run.The next day I tried Morrisons again, and in fairness, they have improved. So I have moved back to them. Anyway, let's see how long this one lasts, because I fear Aldi have delicate ears and will ask for it to be removed.",0,2
Aldi UK,The most racist company I've experienced,"Shopped at this diabolical company on several occasions and on 5 or 5 occasions, the cashier conveniently told me that she was closing the till but as soon as I moved to a different queue, the same member of staff would immediately continue to serve the customers who were behind me.Complained to their customer services dept who told me that this would be dealt with and that they would get back to me ... but the call never came.

Aldi UK,The customer certainly does not come first at Aldi,"My first attempt at doing the weekly shop at Aldi today; I won't be returning.It's chaotic: I finally found the light bulbs I required in a central aisle, all types jumbled up together in one box, stocked next to next to jars of curry sauce, bottles of discounted wine and car cleaning fluid. No wonder it was busy: customers holding shopping lists were wandering back and forth looking baffled, their trollies blocking the narrow aisles. I can whistle around Asda in half the time it took me to shop in Aldi.Later, when I finally got near the front of the checkout queue, I heard the lady at the till instruct the couple in front of me not to put their purchases into bags, but to put them straight back into the trolley, and then bag them later outside in the car park (in the wind and rain!) This was to save time, she said, on the instructions of the store manager, as they were very busy and the store would be closing soon. I had already got my shopping bags open ready in my trolley, so I told her that that would be most inconvenient, and I would be bagging my purchases as she checked them out. She then proceeded at breakneck speed but I managed to keep up with her, moving at the speed of a Formula 1 pit crew mechanic; so then she had to agree (sulkily) that I had not held up the queue by daring to bag my purchases! As I left I suggested that she might remind her manager that the convenience of customers should take precedence over that of the company.",0,2
Aldi UK,Only baskets & carts 'allowed',"I have been using my local Catford Aldi for the best part of a year now for my main shopping, twice a week or more. Although I am not wild about their choice, prices are good & the staff are very pleasant indeed.I am 70 years old, and I take my shopping trolley into the store - I put my items into it & take them out at the checkout; I do this because I don't need a trolley & baskets are horrid, they bang against my legs.Today while there doing my usual shop, a member of staff took me aside & told me that ""I am not allowed to use my shopping trolley"" in this way. At checkout, I asked to see the sign that informs customers of this - there was none. The security guard just babbled at me that ""it was wrong"" in wobbly English & wouldn't even look me in the face.So... I am not 'allowed' to use my trolley in there? What will happen if I do? Do I get arrested?? After many many times of shopping in Aldi, this is the first time anyone has ever told me this. And last but not least, is it lawful to dictate to a customer how he/she can move his/her items around a store??",0,3
Aldi UK,All savings more than wipe out by rip off parking fine,"I have today received a Parking charge notice from Parking Eye for using an ALID car park on the Ring Road Stourbridge while shopping in their store.My wife started using this store a few months ago and has been try to get me to do the same; I usually shop at Tesco who have a free car park just a few 100 yards away. I gave into my wife’s suggestion and use the store for the first time. I was impressed that and even returned at the same time a week later (I will expect a notice for that date as too?).It was not clear to me that I needed to do anything about parking at the store and this strange system is totally alien to me. I have had no such problems at Tesco just round the corner or any other store in my life time. With this being such an unusual system I would expect till staff to bring it to my attention or issue a notice to warn valued customers. I had no idea I would be so inconvenienced by shopping at ALDI. If I have to pay this fee, this trip will have cost me almost double what I spent at the store. I was also under the impression it was not legal to make a profit from store car parks?Be interested to hear from ALDI and others experiencing this same injustice.",0,1
Aldi UK,more than pleasantly surprised!!,"With having 6 children food bills over the years have gone through the roof, we have always used to big 4 supermarkets alternating between them dependant on which gave us best value for money at the time. Having previously been to aldi and been unimpressed my husband suggested we try again and if we didn't like it or like the taste of the things we bought we would switch back to the big four, and to my own surprise I've decided we're sticking with aldi! We attended our local store mid week and the car park was full (lots of bmw's and the like) we spent a good hour and a half looking through everything and bought a weeks worth of food for our large family at around half the price we usually pay. We've been back this week and done the same again but have given some of the items we didn't like so much a miss this time (there were a handful at most) our kids love the food especially the sweet treats such as biscuits etc but I'm most impressed with the quality of the meat and poultry products as well as the price which is miles cheaper than the big 4 but tastes just as good! I've given the nappies a try this time as their highly rated by many mother and baby sites but again if I find them not as good as other leading brands I just won't buy them again. The store itself was clean and tidy, the shelves were more than well stocked and the staff were extremely helpful and quick on the tills given it was a busy night at the end of the week. We will definitely be sticking to aldi from now on and will only switch back if they become like the big 4 that constantly offer you 2 for 1 deals that you don't want or need or raise their prices dramatically. There was a stigma attached to aldi shoppers when I was younger but I'm proud to say I get a better value for money by shopping there than anywhere else!",0,5
Aldi UK,Brilliant,"I love, Love, LOVE this store in Bishop's Stortford. I don't go in there for conversation or surroundings - I want value and speed - I get both. Formerly a regular shopper in Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury - I now enjoy saving money and a short shop. No 'two for one' deals - I live alone - so no benefit for me (I found I was throwing so much away by being tempted by the DEAL from the larger chains). I speak to 'well heeled' people in the queue (much quicker than the larger supermarkets) who proudly proclaim that they are avid supporters of the likes of Aldi and Lidl and witness very posh cars in the car park. Value is clearly upmost in peoples minds now - not being ripped off! I wonder who is writing the scathing reviews?!?",0,5
Aldi UK,"Weird, very weird! and a bit icky too!","Having seen numerous articles in the media talking about Aldi's record profits and how marvellous and cheap it is and being as I like to save a few pennies as much as the next guy, I trundled on down to my local and relatively new store in Great Harwood to see for myself.I have to say I was more than a little disappointed with the whole Aldi experience. From the unambiguous brands to all the wrapped in plastic fruit and veg, I have a hard time believing that well to do middle class folk are ditching Waitrose and M & S for this, all in the name of saving a few pennies.This building is around a year old and yet it felt as, dull, grey and jaded as the expressions of the faces of the people that traipsed the aisles. The vegetables and fruit where all pre-packed and sweating in plastic bags, the variety of meat was small and no cheaper than any of my usual haunts and I don't recall seeing any fresh fish anywhere. The strangest thing about Aldi though are the centre aisles bursting with cheap market stall tat. I literally walked along an aisle with biscuits and jam on my right and wire baskets full of a variety of random things from sledgehammers to awful faux leather moccasins on my left. Returning to the food which I would assume would be the primary reason for most people to visit Aldi, I have to say the level of variety is really very poor. Its like going to a bite sized ASDA or Tesco but only stocked full of own brand goods. You will not recognise any of the brands in Aldi from any other of the big four supermarkets you may have visited and this suggests you get what you pay for in terms of quality. For people who feel uncomfortable buying supermarket own brand products for fear of inferred pitiful glances at the checkouts I can see the appeal of shopping at Aldi. However, for people who prefer variety, shopping in a clean brightly lit store and for whom eating is not merely a necessary bodily function, then the few extra pennies it might cost to shop at one of the big four would be money well spent.",0,2
Aldi UK,Treat their staff like lower life form slaves,Was in store at the new Blackburn branch and witnessed a manager/supervisor berating a young member of staff in front of the customers. The young girl was clearly upset and the woman was talking to her as if she were an inmate in a prison camp. Utterly shocking especially when a quick search on the internet reveals many more cases of this poor treatment of their staff. A prime case of the worst kind of management. Pure bullying,0,1
Aldi UK,IAM VERY DEGUSTED,"hi there this is more of a complaint i have shop in the sheerness store now for about 2 years, i go in there everyday buying my shopping dayley as i have a very large family to feed and i find ALDI store saves me a lot off money. lots of the staff no who iam and also my children, on tuesday the 30th of sept 2014 i go in there after 2.30 pm and iam walking around with my friend we both have double buggies which i take in the store every day, one woman in there which had light to brown hair sees me anuff times in the store deciede to follow me around the store i always try and carry a basket around with me and try and push my double as i cant push a trolly, when my basket is full or i get milk or bottle of drinks i tend to put under my buggy untill i get to check out or what ever else i need goes underneath i do this everyday i go in, well i get to the checkout and iam quenceing the woman comes over to speak to the lady with very light blonde hair which has serve me the most out of the 2 years and looks at me and actully points at me in front of everyone she couldnt off made that obverouis if she try.then the blonde hair woman gets out and walks over to the young boy who has also serve me lots of tims and shouts out watch her with the blue pram you could of heard her from the back of the store i got very upset at that as lots of people are thinking that iam a thrieve, as i got to the checkout after loading my items i said to him you wanna check my pram my bags etc that i had on me as i said i heard you from over there and i have found this very insulting as i shop in hear everyday and i didnt even get a appolgie, i no they are looking out for thieves but come on a reglaular customor that comes in everyday and never had that, i wont shop in there now unless i get a appolgie out of the store they have really upset me!",0,2

Aldi UK,Never again..,"My elderly dad shopped at a different branch of Aldi than he usually goes to. He did not notice the signs saying that he had to input his car registration into the in-store terminal and he received a £70 fine in the post, from a company called parking eye. He contacted aldi by email and explained the situation and provided them with proof that he'd shopped there but they would not cancel the fine. What a funny way to treat your loyal customers, Aldi might be doing well at the moment but if this is the way they operate, that could quickly change. My dad is no longer going to shop at Aldi due to this situation and my 5 brothers and sisters as well as myself are all refusing to now shop in Aldi. Back to Asda for me..",0,1
Aldi UK,Basket Case,"I've long detested the Aldi basket off-side rule. Unloading your basket onto the conveyor and not being allowed to take the basket through the checkout is ridiculous.When a checkout is about to be opened because of queues I am told to simultaneously load at the front and leave the basket at the end. This means running back with the basket, past those shoppers that have followed me (if I'm lucky the basket is relayed in a game of pass-the-parcel) while the cashier attempts to disprove the rules of general relativity by passing my items through the scanner faster than the speed of light.Tonight as I fumbled to juggle my items from the checkout, I overheard another cashier remarking to a customer ""yeah, it's easier now you can use your basket at the till"". My cashier had just watched me unload at the far-end and deposit my basket in the end-zone without saying a word.They have rescinded this rule once before only to reinstate it a few days later, quietly, like a cruel joke, waiting for an unsuspecting shopper to fall foul of their trap.As I tried to ascertain the reasoning for this new found wisdom, the cashier took umbrage and somewhere in his rebuke stated ""It's policy. They don't want you to use a basket. They like trolleys"".This remark seems to suggest that the basket has somehow become a marketing weapon, psychologically designed to impede and infuriate while the trolley beckons you with its shiny, free-wheeling ways.In fact the basket is L'enfant terrible. Aldi only provided baskets in 2012 after UK shoppers petitioned them via Facebook.So why do Aldi only want to provide trolleys? Could it be that those marketing types have an idea that you don't want to be seen with a trolley that isn't (or doesn't) appear ""full"" enough and you'd be embarrassed and compelled to throw a few more things in there just to save face.It also allows the cashier to be a little less accurate as they push their hand-eye coordination to the limit as they slam-dunk your produce.I realise that in order to keep prices low you must make use of practises and procedures that allow better utilisation of time and staff but the enforced basket ""policy"" slowed things down. If they really want to speed things up you should target those shoppers who seem to think of the conveyor as a runway that must be completely clear before they ""land"" their items or that items can only be placed on the conveyor in single-file at 2 second intervals. Maybe it's an hommage to the Generation Game.",0,3
Aldi UK,"Paying to park at Aldi, while i shop instore","How on earth are you supposed to do a family shop in half an hour, I took 36 minutes and you issue me with a £70 fine I may as well go and do my shop elswhere it will work out cheaper! Aldi you seriously are losing customers with this ridiculous parking scam! Get a pay and display machine like morrisons this way you won't lose customers and will still be able to track who is rightfully shopping at your store!",0,1
Aldi UK,Oh we are ALDI! What customer service?!!,"The above sentence was said to me (more or less) by the store manager at ALDI branch in Sheffield London road. I do sometimes shop from ALDI if I pass the store on my way but not often. I don't like all the products and mainly buy fresh veg and fruit if I go to the store. Last visit bought some veg and fruit and was queuing with a lady with one chewing gum behind me in the queue. The cashier asked if she could serve that lady first because she only had one item. I agreed reluctantly as I was in hurry but because I was put in a awkward position I said yes...I usually offer this myself if I can and did not appreciate to be asked but apparently this is the store policy to ask!As soon as the lady was served, there was another guy behind with 2 items in his hand and he asked me if he could also get served before I did and I refused! I said to the girl at the till and I did not mean to be awkward but I did not appreciate him asking me and if that is the policy I could be in the queue forever if everyone behind me had one item to pay for! She was not interested but I did not expect her to be as I know how they operate and all they are interested in is to scan items and you pay without delay, so I shut up and let it go. When I was putting the shopping bag in the car, the same guy from the queue appeared next to me and started talking b*** and being sarcastic. I told him where to go and he deserved the reply he got, he disappeared but then I decided to share my experience with the store manager. When I was taken to him, I shared my thoughts and said I did not think this is nice to ask customers to give their turn to other customers as this puts that person in an awkward position and that it gives some people the opportunity to be an a*******. He said but we are ALDI, we can only give you cheap products because of our til system. Many people don't like that they have to pack their trolly after they pay but we are ALDI. We cannot control how other people behave...."". I understood what he said and partly agreed and I said I did not expect the customer service of Waitrose from you but it does not mean you should not care how your customers feel! He basically was not interested, was not empathising at all and kept repeating "" but we are ALDI""... and at the end I said so your answer to my feedback is that you are ALDI and turned and he was like, humm yeah...So yes I know you are ALDI and now I know ALDI means cheap products, cheap customer service. Will not buy from you again not that you are bothered!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Parking to shop at Aldi cost me £70,"4/8/2014 9.15. I called in at Aldi in Truro, I brought some goods and then left for work 15 mins later.4/8/2014 17.05. My wife called at the same store and did some shopping and left 20 mins later.19/8/2014. I received a letter from a company, Parking Eye who manages Aldi's Truro car park demanding £70, claiming my car was parked in the car park for over eight hours. I responded straight away sending proof of our shopping by sending copies of our receipts and card transactions.21/8/2014. Parking Eye wrote back to us to say ""the charge still stands"".Is this demanding money with menaces? We were only going shopping!",0,1
Aldi UK,WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUGS AS EXTRA INGREDIENTS IN FOOD DESPICABLE,"Just started to do shopping in aldi 2 weeks ago at first i thought this is excellent value. But did not expect extra ingredients in food. On sat nite i had decided to make my 2 year old daughter a packet of there pasta n sauce which was tomato and herb flavour. On opening the packet i had saw something come out which at first looked like a bit of onion skin. When product was cooked and i looked further at it it was a bug of some sort. I called aldi where i got nowhere and they said that they would not test it and that they would send me out a gesture of good will which i think is unacceptable as this could have made my child sick if she had of ate it. I told them this on the phone where then they further advised me to take it back to the store where i had bought it where i also got nowhere. I am now sending the bug to enviromental health for further testing as i got no help what so ever from aldi as they told me they would not investigate this bug to see what it is. I will never shop at aldi again because my kids health come first over saving a few pounds on my shopping. They handled this disgracefully in my opinion and they do not seem to put there customers first. aldi should be ashamed of themselves. Yes tescos and asda might be a bit more expensive but they treat their customers with the rights that they have and a lot more respect is shown from the bigger companies. would not recommend anybody to do shopping in aldi, i never will again!!!!!!!!!!!!! very very poor customer services with no sense of respect for there customers",0,1
Aldi UK,Excellent value and quality,"A new Aldi opened near us. Have visited on a few occasions and have to admit the food is excellent quality, comparable with the branded items. Prices excellent.Recommended",0,5
Aldi UK,Not impressed,My hubby and I headed to the brand new Aldi near our home this week. We were going to do our regular grocery shopping but there is no way I can do that.First we could find no cold cereals without sugar being high on the ingredient list for the item.Then we looked at Peanut Butter. Again there was sugar/cornsyrup in every kind we saw there. There was no regular fruit spread. All of it had corn syrup.The meat looked ok. We had the 80/20 burger patties which were about the same price as anywhere. They tasted ok. The pork chops are in my freezer for tomorrow.No whole grain breads were available. There was an extremely limited fresh fruit and veggie section. The Bananas were very good. But then they were organic and 35 cents a pound more than I could get the same thing at Sprouts. There was also only a small canned foods area. One or two brands and both of them seemed to be store brands for Aldi.The Dairy was also limited and smelled slightly off. We did buy some cheese which is good.Here's what I noticed. It's a brand new store and already feels and smells dirty. Many of the products are geared to Latinos and Asians. No problem with that really if you are buying for curry or empanadas. It felt like a convenience store that inconveniently has little of what you need. It's a shame to me as I was hoping for a good close neighborhood grocery. Perhaps they will get better. I can hope.,0,2
Aldi UK,High chair horror,"I bought a high chair an Aldi branded high chair in April. Started using it in July the safety harness started falling apart in August. Can't find the receipt so they'll take their product back to investigate but won't replace or refund it. I repeat this is an own brand baby product that has failed!So I'll use what's left of my maternity pay and buy for a proper shop who recognise their own brands!Never ever again will I spend a penny in Aldi, profits ahead of safety!",0,1
Aldi UK,"disorganized, smelly and poor value",I called today to try out the new store with an open mind. I tried to get the type of muesli we usually have but all of their fruit or nut variety had added sugar. The grapefruit were 35p each but on the same day at Waitrose they were 3 for a pound. The mixed peppers looked good so I got those. There was no organic skimmed milk. The frozen product aisle smelt of fish so I avoided that. I was disappointed with the total experience and left without getting all I needed. The assistant did not speak English clearly. I am willing to give it one more try when I need household products,0,2
Aldi UK,My first (and last) visit to Aldi,"There is a new Aldi store in my town, it opened a couple of months ago and today I decided to pay a visit. I really wish I hadn't bothered.I bought a pack of 'Oakhurst Easy Cook French Style Chicken Breasts' which I cooked for tonight's dinner. The meat was grey, tough and fibrous, the sauce was thick and tasteless. Its almost impossible to ruin one of these 'ready to cook' chicken dishes and I have bought dozens of them before from Sainsbury's and Tesco's, yes they are around 50 pence more expensive from those stores, but the thing is that they are edible! In fact they are really nice. This rubbish sold by Aldi is a disgrace. Never again will I step into an Aldi store.",0,2
Aldi UK,where is the stuff....,I am a regular shopper at Aldi's Bevois Valley store in Southampton. Who on earth decided to change the lay out making it almost impossible to locate items...Totally unnecessary!!!,0,4
Aldi UK,Good value  No frills products.,Looks like a lot of snobs on here with some of the comments. Willing to pay a lot more for overpriced goods. Why should the customer pay for special lighting or too much staff or get ripped off with BOGOFF deals. When you are actually paying for the extra item with other products. No wonder Aldi and Lidl are eating into the profits of the big stores. About time. And they also prefer to buy a lot of Scottish products reducing the carbon footprint and helping the local economy. The big stores are squeezing suppliers at a cost. Long live Aldi and Lidl.,0,4
Aldi UK,Aldi is a Thumbs UP,"Aldi is a good place to shop for groceries and household essentials. The things I find at a price I like are cereals, snacks, milk, eggs, canned vegetables, produce, laundry soap, soup, some of thier frozen prepared foods (heat and eat), fresh cook -if-yourself pizza. They have their own brand of food and most of it is good. The one thing I don't like is the long wait in line to check out. Usually only one checker on duty. But all I all, Aldi is a thumbs up.",0,4
Aldi UK,I can't understand all the hype.,"I seriously cannot understand how Aldi is doing so well, my husband and I walked in to the Mansfield store (that was a new build) and it was dingy, poorly laid out, smelly and like others have said a bit like a jumble sale. We walked round and straight back out. People need to open their eyes and realise that the ""bargains"" they are getting aren't the bargains they think they are. This shop still has rates and rent to pay just like any other business and get they claim to be able to sell food cheaply, well just think someone's getting the bum deal on that somewhere be it the customer, the staff or the suppliers. I shop at Ocado for big shops and Sainsburys for little shops, I am not mega rich but I like myself and my family to eat good quality food. The sooner the hype from Aldi (and the other shop just like it that begins with L) dies down the better before we become infested with budget food shops and become as much as a nuisance as Tesco.",0,1

Aldi UK,Everything's good except the microwave burgers,"I just wanted to say my experience, myself I'm a busy man so I thought I'd buy one of those burgers they have so I did, I got home all exited to try my new meal, with wonder of the taste I took a leap of faith and opened to packet to my surprise a smell sprinted up my noes smelt like a thousand burger festivals all in one packet to get rid of the smell I had to open my windows and doors! Now the smell had gone I thought I deserve this burger this is my burger so I pick it up put it on a plate almost into the microwave and at the corner of my eye I see a slice of cheese and a packet of sauce I grasped at it I signed in relief a positive to a negative I opened the cheese packet and end up ripping my cheese in the pieces (by this time I thought I'd just quit). I screamed in agony as I tried to repair the cheese on top of the burger but it's now funny looking. I've sort of fixed it now, and now is time to add the sauce I wanted a taster so I put a little bit on my finger to try it out as I did I realised that the sauce was cheep, I've never tasted so bad sauce it was disgusting, I used my own sauce. I had finally put my burger in the microwave and put it on for 80 seconds like it had recommended me to. I was staking the burger that I've had most desire for in a while with every time I get closer to it something pulls me away, back to the point I was staking the burger like a fat kid stalks the ice cream truck in his street. Finally I heard the magic noise, the noise that will feed me the noise I have been waiting for, for 80 seconds. I open the door I latch at the plate, but the plate was so hot I had burnt my hands, I dropped the plate, luckily for me the burger was still on the plate at this time I prayed to God thanking him for not letting my burger land on the ground, ( I was an atheist but this changed me) I was ever more so exited to finally try it when it was in reaching distance, but I had to wait a moment it was the longest moment in my life the burger and me making eye contact it knew it was mine and it knew I'm going to eat it, anyway it felt like hours passed until I could touch it without pain and I did I held the burger I was thrilled with excitement urging threw my body but as I touched the bun I felt a wet sensation in my hand, you could even say moist, ever more I have grown more disappointment in the burger but I have never wanted it more than that moment so I did as any reasonable person would do, I'd get two slices of bread cut them into circles and enjoy my 80 second meal so I did, I sat down with a now cold coffee in my left hand and a juicy burger in my right I was about to catch up on my favourite television show Games of thrones so I did I put it on I got all cosy in my nice chair take a sip of now Ice coffee and then decided to take a bite of my juicy fat burger and I did I closed my eyes opened my mouth and took a bite I could feel that my burger had gone lighter I opened my eyes in sudden scare I see the my burger was so juicy it had slipped out of the grip of my bread and landed on the floor usually in this case with food I'd usually use the o'ld, five seconds rule but I have dogs and as the moment it hit the floor my dogs were on it like group of fat kids with only one kitkat left (Yes another fat kid joke). I was destroyed tears fell from my eyes I never got a bite while my dog got it all I felt that all my time and effort into this so called 80 second meal was for nothing but pain and agony to me. I was very disappointed in the meal as so I never got to try it (shortly after this memorable moment I became an atheist again.).",0,2
Aldi UK,"ALDI is a no frills store, can be good, but be careful","What people have to realise is that Aldi is a no frills store. You are not going to get customer toilets and they want you to move away from the checkout asap and pack your bags at the shelf behind, In saying that I am very selective in what I buy from Aldi. They are very good at marketing. In their Scottish stores they play heavily on Scottish products and a great many of these have won Great Taste Awards (check their Scottish website) which goes down well with the Scots. They play on this to get customers through the doors and hope they will buy a lot more. Some of their stuff is awful and you learn by your mistakes but their wine and spirits are good and consistently good value. Be careful with their premium meat, the pack sizes are often small. The store I use in Scotland is always packed with customers and the aisles are loaded up with pallets which should really be refrigerated. The store is not air conditioned and is very hot in the summer - air conditioning in a food store is mandatory, not a no frills option.In my store the glass on a freezer cabinet has been been broken for 3 months now and has been ""mended"" with cardboard.",0,3
Aldi UK,My local Aldi is fantastic and I disagree with the opinions I've read!,"My local Aldi in Smethwick (Sandwell) is great! All the food I have tried has always been fresh and delicious and much cheaper than it's competitors. I buy the steaks which are unbeatable value and quality and now I make my own steak dinner once a week for a few pounds and it tastes better and is more tender than the steak meals I used to pay over £20 for in restaurants, and I eat regularly in some very nice, highly acclaimed places across the country! I do check the use by dates when I buy things for the fridge and sometimes there are only a couple of days left on things like ready meals so I fish out the ones with later dates at the back of the pile but this is the same in any supermarket I've been to. I understand when people say the products are less well presented than in other shops but it's not much worse and in fairness, they re-stock items that sell quickly so fast and probably save some costs on manpower. However, the staff are much more friendly in my Aldi than in any other supermarket I have ever been to. They make a point of always calling me ""Sir"" and ask how I am and if there is anything they can help with and wish me well when I leave and anytime I have returned anything such as a kids scooter when my nephew wanted a different colour, they did it without question (With receipt). What more can I say? I'm almost embarrassed sometimes at how much they try to help me if it is unnecessarily. There is never a long queue when I check out. When there's any more than about 4 in line, they open another till. This customer service is great and it is obviously something that Aldi think is important, the staff are well trained, enthusiastic and polite and in my local store they will stop whatever they are doing to help, whatever I ask them about, even if it means them going into the back of the shop to look for something I can't see on the shelves, they honestly couldn't be better! I buy lots of products that are cheaper than the ""Value"" products in other shops where they taste terrible but the cheaper Aldi product tastes as good as or sometimes better then the ""Superior"" or ""Finest"" etc products the other shops sell and as good as M&S or Waitrose where they are at least twice the price! The middle isle is something I think you either love or hate!! To me it's full of things that I wouldn't put on a shopping list but kept meaning to buy at some point over the past year but never got around to actually purchasing it or when I find it, it's more expensive than I thought so didn't buy it. I personally love looking through the middle isle and finding bargains and things I didn't go out to intentionally purchase but are such amazing deals I end up getting one and now I have loads of stuff in the house that I use all the time and if it hadn't been for Aldi I would be living without.. Or paying much more! Anyway, I think Aldi is great and would encourage others to give it a try and not to judge on perhaps one bad experience they have had maybe due to one staff member who has had a bad day that day. That's life!",0,4
Aldi UK,Poor Fresh Fruit,"I love Aldi,the quality and price is excellent, however the on line that lets them down badly is the fresh fruit section. The bananas only stay fresh for a day and the apples are only good for 2-3 days, its as though all there fresh fruit is sold past its best before date, Tescos fruit however is far better quality. Shame thats the only thing that lets the shop down",0,4

Aldi UK,Awfull customer service,"NEW ALDI WALKDEN-GREATER MANCHESTER. They seem NOT to care AT ALL about customers service. If you find it difficult to hurry yourself through the till and pack quickly you will end with half of your goods pushed on the floor as the salesperson doesn't care about you, just quickly push the items through scanner and there isn't even table provided for you to pack your items. You have to manage to keep your bag in the air with one hand and with another to put your goods in the bag and if you not extremely fast , the salesperson just pushes your goods until they start falling on the floor. So you have goods you paid for pick up from the floor. Its absolutely humiliating!!!!!! I have never experienced such an appalling customer service anywhere. I feel absolutely disgusted with this shop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,Dangerous generators.,"I bought one of Aldi's Workzone 800w generators on 7/7/14, thinking it would be a nice handy source of external power for my canal and river boat. I first filled it with fuel on 11/7/14 and following instructions, started it. No problems, a bit noisy, but does the job. After 5 minutes I switched it off to let it cool before I stored it on the boat. I picked it up and found a damp patch on the ground, so checked over the generator and found it was leaking fuel just above the fuel tap. I returned it to Risca store in S.Wales on 14/7/14, letting the manager know of the faul. He replaced it with another, stating it was the first he had heard of this fault. I put a litre of premixed fuel in it and waited a few hours. Before attempting to start it, I checked it over and behold a fuel leak was coming from above the tap. I took it back to the store, told the manager of the fuel leak and stated that there was fuel still in the tank. He gave me back my money, apologised, and got a member of staff to store the faulty generator with the one I returned in the morning. This was in the corner of the store. Health and safety? We still smelt the fuel 3/4 hour later. I advise anyone who bought one of these to thoroughly check it over for leaks and DO NOT store in a confined space. I have complained to the after sale service, and now I hope others will be aware of this very dangerous fault. I have bought hand and power tools from Aldi in the past and found no problems, but because of the action and lack of health and safety knowledge of the staff at this store, I rate them poorly. BEWARE.",0,1
Aldi UK,Rotten Food,"I have been shopping in Aldi on and off. I went in to the local Aldi store in Bradford with my 2 children. I put a few groceries in the trolley and then put a 12 pouch of cat food into the trolley. My 15 year old son said mum something smells, I looked into the trolley and were shocked. The cat food box was eaten from 1 side by mice, I could see into the sealed which had also been bitten. There were maggots crawling in pouch, I took it out and gave it to the lady on the closest till. All she said was leave it here and I will tell the manager. She did not seem shocked as it was everyday practice and then she said if you want to tell the manager she on the last till. I went and told the lady who again pointed me to another lady. Then i went back to the first lady and asked her where the box is, she had put it in a black bag in the corner of the store. I asked her to get it for me, I started taking pictures of the box I took 2 pictures and all 3 staff came running to me. One picked the box up and said I am the manager I will report this. I asked for the box to take some more pictures she walked off with it.I then reported this to the food agency and cutting it short. Aldi denied everything that i did not report it, However I had a receipt with a ladies name on it. She I was told had a reward for good customer service. I had my daughter in the trolley and other food the cat food was right next to all the other food, it had maggots crawling inside it and Aldi are lying the it ever happened. I have nothing personal against against Aldi or any of the staff there, but this is just terrible. Why lye? They do not want to shame the store. My experience in Aldi has been terrible, appalling, I will never shop at Aldi again. Everyone I have told are disgusted at what had happened and how the staff have denied it all. Everyone I know will never shop at Aldi again. ALDI IS THE WORST STORE EVER.",0,1
Aldi UK,Cheap food but lacking service.,"I like Aldi because of high quality, cheap food. Much cheaper than big supermarkets. But they don't seem to care much about customer service. If you are old like me, I find it difficult to hurry myself through the till, and pack quickly. I have been told many times to hurry up because she had a long line of customers waiting. You would never get that at Sainsbury's, or Tesco. But I suppose one can't have anything",0,3
Aldi UK,Beware the Sneaky Underhand Parking Fines,"Just got a £70 fine for 'overstaying' in Aldi's Boscombe store. As a paying customer I would expect to at least be informed that this time restriction was in place. Signage is appalling. I would have gone elsewhere to do my shopping if I had known about the £70 tax on shopping at Aldi. Further, I find I now have to deal with Parking Eye – a well documented bunch of cowboy bullies with a notorious reputation for ripping off the general public.I guess it’s not just the shoddy products that help Aldi keep its prices low. It’s now using underhand and sneaky tactics to help its bullyboy business partner threaten its customers with court – for a share of the booty presumably.Not only that but #ParkingEye issued the ticket on June 20 and it didn’t arrive until July 6. Even Royal Mail aren’t that bad. Something devious is going on to make it impossible to pay the ‘reduced’ amount of £40. Not that I am going to pay a penny for this cheating scam.Don’t expect me back in Aldi anytime soon. And do expect to see more of this story online – everywhere.",0,1

Aldi UK,I AM NOT A SHOPLIFTER,"I have been a customer at the Aldi store in Fallowfield ever since it opened here 2 years ago. During the last 6 months new security guards arrived in the store. Since their arrival it has made for the most unpleasant shopping experience. They follow you around the store and if god forbid if you look at the 21 day matured steaks, you can feel their breath on your neck. I am the owner of a local community media business, I know this community very well and have lots of respect, I spend over £200 a week in the store. i would never dream of stealing anything. This weekend was the final straw when the till operator asked to look in my bags, I'm 55 years old. I called for the manager, who looked about 10, he said he was sorry but just looked very bored with it all really. I rang head office and spoke with a very rude young man, who basically said, they are only doing their job and if I""m not shop lifting I have nothing to worry about. I have made a decision never to shop there again - after shopping for 20 years in Sainsburys and never ever encountered this treatment.. I find it insulting to be treated in this way and I am one of many in my community. The Aldi store up the road in the much more affluent Didsbury does not treat it customers in this way as it would find their store empty.",0,1
Aldi UK,maggot in cheese? LMAO. Aldi sell great products at good prices.,"at my local aldi (bristol) i have found the staff helpfull and service very good. as for NW finding maggots in her cheese, well she should have kept it in the fridge covered. btw i can highly recommened the plum apple custard strudel just wish there was more custard imo.",0,5
Aldi UK,Customer service are patronising and very unhelpful.,"I found a maggot in a piece of cheese bought from Aldi which still had more than a month before it's expiry date. When contacting Aldi customer services to complain I was contacted by phone and told that they would not refund the cheese as I did not have the receipt and had thrown the cheese in the bin. When I started to explain how disgusted I was I patronised by the agent telling me to stop shouting at her and she was terminating the call. I did not shout at her and she just continued to tell me she was terminating the call. I said I would write a review about this and I was told ""go on then"" and was cut off.",0,1
Aldi UK,Wagyu Steak con,"Just returned from Aldi - went to try the specials on offer today - Wagyu steak £6.99 each. After seeing and hearing all the promotional talk, I thought I'd try a couple. No chance, I was told they had sold what few they had within 1/2hr of opening. As usual with Aldi they quote great prices but then don't back them up with any stock. It's just a con to get you in the store knowing anybody with a job will miss out !",0,1
Aldi UK,price of goods rising rapidly in aldi,Fruit and veg is very substandard and only lasts one day if you are lucky. Also now they have got the main market off Tesco and Asda the price of the goods in Aldi are very quickly increasing in price!,0,2

I JUST FEEL THAT STANDARDS HAVE SLIPPED IN THE DISPLAY OF GOODS AND IT IS A SHAME AS I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE PROMOTED THE STORE TO OTHER SHOPPERS WHO HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IS LESS THAN IN OTHER STORES. I HOPE THE LOCAL MANAGEMENT ARE INFORMED OF MY COMMENTS,0,3
Aldi UK,"Norton Stoke on Trent ""Rude & ignorant""","I always thought there was something for the old saying that the customer is always right well it may be old fashioned but where would a retailer be without us?Well if you shop at Aldi Norton Stoke on Trent you can not only forget all that the attitude seems more like we are doing you a favour I found this out when trying to get a loaf of bread to be told be a stroppy middle aged woman ""I need all this area"" as she was filling the shelves she then stood & glared while I walked away I muttered ""customer"" it has happened in other aisles same person same bad attitude some of the younger staff are quiet nice I must say but another saying I recall is about "" one bad apple""Customer service is low priority Im guessing & have to agree with other comments about similarity with jumble sales ~ even then they might put stuff in a bag rather than fling it at you & demand ""cash or card"" before you get a chance to do your own packing.The likes of Tesco & Morrisons are catching up fast recently offering well known trusted products,with consistent quality very competitive prices & customer service that values its customers rather than abuse them",0,1
Aldi UK,THIS COMPANY IS AN ILLEGAL OPERATION,"Aldi, UK is not operating the correct age consent for alcohol , they ask for ID to prove you're over 25 when the law of the land states it is 18 - very rude staff as well (Chorley store) - It's also suspicious why you can't post on to their Facebook wall - they want you to believe what they TELL YOU NOT WHAT THE TRUTH IS",0,1
Aldi UK,ILLEGAL UK WARRANTY,"Anyone that tries to use the 3 year warranty without a receipt and get turned away please be aware also are operating against UK law.

Aldi UK,Prices going up!,We've been shopping at Aldi for years but have noticed over the past few months that prices have started to creep up. Still good value for money though. Aldi is still the cheapest out of all the supermarkets but I get the feeling it won't be long till their is little or no difference in price between them.,0,5
Aldi UK,Shop Elsewhere,"Aldi are like anyone else - they are chasing the buck. I reported bad frozen food to them right on Easter. It took them a week to respond and then it was simply to say they were ""investigating"". My opinion was that this freezer food had been contaminated in their supply chain by being left out of freezer conditions, allowed to thaw, and was then cycled through to retail - no quality control. Nothing further (they were going to send me a letter of explanation when their investigations were completed by post - I said email thanks, don't want you posting stuff to me. So I heard nothing more ..... until today when the local store manager phoned me to explain that he had tested all their stock in store and there was nothing wrong with it. (Did he thaw it all, test it, and refreeze it/). I suggested that I did not want his explanation as to how Aldi were not at fault. He got tetchy with me and said I was being awkward. So I said I have the money and I will shop elsewhere with it.Did Aldi ever address my concerns as a customer? No. They addressed their concerns to say they did nothing wrong.As a customer I am clearly at fault.Goodbye Aldi. You could have at least offered me a refund!",0,1
Aldi UK,spent half the amount of money i would normally!,"oh my god, aldi is amazing. everyone wants a supermarket they can go into and not have to take a loan out just to buy your weekly shop! in other leading supermarkets i would spend around £150 on a weekly shop, yet in aldi you can buy the same stuff - different brand - for £60. i can't express how much this has helped me and my family. thanks aldi!",0,5
Aldi UK,How did they ever win an award ?,"Visited Aldi with my wife to see what all the fuss was about. Now I am scratching my head to see what all the fuss was about.What a horrible place to shop, it was like going into a car boot sale, lowest quality products dumped everywhere, did not find a single thing that I would have bought. Who on earth gave them an award? I'll stick to my usual supermarket, spend a bit more, but know I won't catch anything unpleasant.",0,1
Aldi UK,Never Again.,"Have been shopping at Aldi since they opend the store in Kendal, but never again am i going to shop at Aldi stores after trying on some shoes they did not fit so i put them back on the shelf and walked out the store only to be followed and confronted by a member of staff asking if they could see in my bags assuming id walked out the store with the shoes. Never felt humiliated as much as that time. Awful place to shop bad customer experience. Manager was unreasonable when i confronted him about it.The store has gone downhill from the time it first opend.",0,1
Aldi UK,Do not buy power tools from aldi as they have no after sales support.,"I have several power tools that I use in diy.I have a Powercraft belt sander that is less than 3 years old but I dont have the receipt, any way the drive belt on the tool broke so I contacted the helpline on the book supplied with the product, they told me that they no longer support this range and that I should contact aldi to find out who now supports this product, they told me to ring a number so as I could effect a repair but thi number was the same as the company who told me to contact aldi.So I spoke with customer services who said that as I did not have a receipt that they could not help me but I told them I was not bothered about claiming against the warranty I just wanted to buy a neww belt.they say that once a product is out of warrany that there is no after sales support. All I want is to use my sander but it is useless and I presume all of my other power tools in the same range as they are older than the warranty.So I wont be buying tools etc from aldi in the future, they should stick to selling groceries.",0,1
Aldi UK,Never again!,"So Aldi have won all these ""awards"", I thought I'd give them a try. Wish I hadn't.Went into my local ""store"". It looked like a jumble sale. The shelves were ""filthy"" - looked as if they hadn't been cleaned for months. There was stuff everywhere. And there was only one checkout open with a queue which was about a ""mile"" long!In the end I left without buying anything. I also didn't find the prices any better than the deals and budget prices for the ""food"" at my local Asda or Sainsburys. Overall disappointed - will not be back!",0,1
Aldi UK,Dodgy Steam Cleaner,"I bought an aldi steam cleaner which I was waiting for my husband to put together. A few months later he did and found cannot use as a faulty manufacture ,bottom part doesn't fit the body of steam cleaner . Unfortunetly receipt is mislaid. Contacted Aldi aerial manager said without receipt cannot do nothing contacted the manufacture they said the same. This steam cleaner is only supplied by Aldi so its not as if currys etc do it.

Aldi UK,"Aldi, Swadlincote, Derbyshire","I have been shopping at Aldi since Christmas and for the first time in two years I am not overdrawn at the end of the month.

Aldi UK,Complaints not followed through!,"On the whole I like Aldi for some of their prices. Fruit and veg is much the same price as Asda and Morrisons and not always as fresh! I never do a full shop there. On the whole I find the staff in the Hull branch very friendly but yes I agree it can be a bit manic at the cash out if you're not speedy...fortunately I'm not disabled ot very elderly, so I manage.I buy their seafood sticks...love them but as I don't shop there each week I froze some as it said on pocket they were suitable for home freezing. What a disaster! The taste and texture changed and they were watery an stringy! I threw them out!I wrote to customer care because I stupidly thought that they would look into it and maybe alter their packaging and prevent anyone else wasting their money. I got a reply fairly quickly saying that it would be passed on to the relevant department. I have not heard anything since. That was 3 weeks ago. I have since been in to buy more and it still says product suitable for home freezing!All this advertising Aldi and it is paying off but don't get complacent....customer care is important...people read reviews and poor reviews are bad advertising!",0,3
Aldi UK,Always Be Prepared To Go Elsewhere,"I routinely shop at Aldi Aylesbury, and am generally pleased.Products are of good value and it does cut down on ever increasing bills by doing my shop at Aldi.The downside is that while one week you may find everything you need; another week can leave you wanting.Do the same shop week in week out at Tesco and you will always find the products available.To sum up: I continue to do my shop at Aldi, but now allowing more time, because chances are i will have to go on to Tesco for all the things Aldi didn't have this week that were there the last.",0,3
Aldi UK,Outstanding,"My wife, myself and mother in law plus nearly all my neighbors shop at Aldis and have done for years. Cant believe the reviews we have been reading as that bears no resemblance at all to our experience over the years. Empty shelves as in one review, never in all our year have we seen empty shelves. Rude staff again have never experienced that before. Tend to look at Aldi as our very friendly corner store with very low prices. We dont buy our wine anywhere else exceptional quality and the smoked salmon marinated in pesto sauce was to kill for.All we can say is Aldi you cant do no wrong as far as we are concerned.",0,5
Aldi UK,Very rude staff,"Went into the Boston store today to do our shopping. Staff were very rude and unhelpful, no customer service skills at all even from the boy who must have stolen the assistant managers badge because judging by his age he couldn't be old enough to be an assistant manager. He obviously had no reasoning skills so resorted to arguing with me and told me he didn't want customers like me in his store, well, guess what? I wont be in there again!Went into Asdas and the staff were very polite and helpful. When I did some price comparisons, Asda were no more expensive. I know where I am shopping in future.",0,1
Aldi UK,The customer service at ALDI is abysmal,"Today I visited my local ALDI in Bebington, Wirral.I soon discovered that if you use a basket and not a trolley, you have considerable difficulties at the checkout due to a severe lack of space at the end of the counter. This, I found to my dismay, was compounded by the lack of consideration of the staff when thrusting your shopping at you faster than you are able to pack it. This, in my case, resulted in a four pint carton of milk falling onto the floor and bursting open, resulting in my shoes and trousers being soaked in milk. Not only did the staff member involved fail to apologise in any way whatsoever, but when they returned with a replacement carton of milk ( which, incidentally, I told them not to do ) they thrust it into my face in a very aggressive manner. I will Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever shop at ANY ALDI again as long as I live!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,1
Aldi UK,"Aldi, 4 Knightscliffe Ave, Glasgow","The PROS are the fresh veg which is well priced and can be of good quality. I don’t recommend the fruit as it’s both overpriced and generally not very good. The CONS are pretty much EVERYTHING else, in particular the staff are such a let down to what could be a good place to shop. They seem to work hard but have exceptionally poor customer facing skills which could be attributable to a lack of training. Customers appear to be an inconvenience on the shop floor and are to be treated like cattle at the checkouts. Basic manners are questionable as staff bellow at each other from behind their tills between barking at customers to get in line at a particular checkout . They close one till, open another, and close another and so on. You are not given any time or the facilities to pack your bags at the till. Your shopping is pushed over the customers in front and the customer’s shopping behind you is pushed over yours. It’s a bit of a joke really. The staff do genuinely work hard but appear poorly trained and therefore come across as very unprofessional. It can be quite embarrassing really. Take a trip to your nearest store and decide for yourself. The staff attitude and culture appears to be a very low priority for Aldi. Management changes would be beneficial and the company culture requires serious review. If Aldi expects to be taken seriously then it must stop coming across like amateur hour at the zoo. These are only my personal opinions of course. Go down to your local store and check it out for yourself. At least you might pick up some reasonably priced veg . . . . . . . and probably find several reasons not to go back.",0,1
Aldi UK,Is Aldi's 60 day money back promise as good as it seems,"We bought a Halogen oven from Aldi some months ago. It had a fault but we managed to replace it at the time. It was really good value for money (much cheaper than similar brands elsewhere) and we got to love the way it cooks. So much so, we bought our daughter one for Xmas and paid £10 shipment down to London. I had tested the oven, twice, prior to shipping but when my daughter tried it the display showed a fault had occurred (exactly the same fault as our first one). Unfortunately, the 60 day money back deal for faulty goods (which at first hand seems a good, no quibble deal for customers) had expired so I urged her to call the helpline given and have it repaired, she really wanted this halogen oven. The people at the repair centre were abrupt and told my daughter that they didn't repair that brand of oven so she would have to get her money back (my money actually), which she has done (strange!!!! after the 60 day clause the product is supposed to be repaired) My grievance is this, nowhere on the box or in the instructions or at the Aldi, did it say that the product could not be repaired. When working this product is excellent and at the price paid is a bargain but now my daughter is going to have to pay up to 3 times as much for a similar item. What is going to happen if my oven decides to develop a fault after all these months, do I get my money back and have to pay 3 times as much also. This 60 day money back is OK if you can buy for the same price at another retailer but not if you get a bargain which often sells out quickly and you can't get another, or the product develops a fault. So Aldi, please bear in mind when selling electrical goods or any non-food items that the customer can get the product repaired after the 60 day clause or it can be replaced during the statutory 12 months guarantee. I may add that this grievance is not a reflection on Aldi in general and/or the other items that Aldi sells but specific to this one anomaly.",0,1
Aldi UK,I'm saving 30% compared to Sainsburys,It's cheap and appears chaotic after the smooth process at Sainsburys or Tescos but the savings Re amazing. The meats are where you really save evening free range. Only shop at sainsburys for things I can't get at aldi now.,0,5

Aldi UK,shop at Aldi and get charged £40 for the pleasure,"Friday 7th Feb. took my 84 year old disabled mother to do her weekly shop, mine to, to Aldi ILKESTON Derbyshire.had to wait 15 to get a parking space, finally got 1 about 80 yards from the shop, walked round to get trolley and start shopping. The shop was very busy and you no what mothers who dont get out much are like, they like to look at everything. Thought that was what supermarkets liked, so you buy more. Anyway, did the shopping, loaded mothers,shopping on to conveyor then mine. Then Paid for our shopping and started packing never thinking of the time, took the shopping bactk to the car unloaded took the trolley back round to store entrance walked back to car got in car finally out of car park. 1hour 30 min is not long enough especially when you have to queue to get in the place walk the whole car park to take trolleys back and pack your own shopping then get a fine for being 19 minutes over your time. £70 or £40 if paid in 14 days disgusting. It Used to be 3 hours why have they changed it",0,1
Aldi UK,ALDI Getting worse,I have been shopping at ALDI for years now only because most items are cheaper but for the past few weeks I find that most shelves are empty and there is no sign to say items are out of stock.when I ask the staff (including the MANAGER) they all say we stock items everyday and they are so busy that items get sold very fast.So how come there is no stock of several items everyday?WILL ALDI management do something otherwise they will loose customers,0,1
Aldi UK,stupid checkout policy,"i shopped at aldi [syston] on the 5/2/14, a place i have shopped at now for two years.all went well until i reached the checkout.i started to put the cleared items into my bag which was in the trolley, only to be told i wasnt to do that, but to put the items into the trolley and then move over to the ""packing area"" to then put the items into my bag.i said i had never been asked to do this before, the retort being ""its company policy"" [which,apparently, it is, although there are no signs].crazy...i can easily keep up with the cashiers which means there is no time saving;the woman in front of me wasnt told to do the same;my spend wasnt much...maybe £15;there is no way i was going to pack twice.the cashier shouldnt have said that, as me being me, told her i no longer wanted the shopping and walked out, knowing full well it would cost the store more time [and money] to remove the shopping from the conveyor belt and replace onto the shelves, than if she had just left me to pack at the c/out.i wont be going back.",0,1
Aldi UK,Aldi - the supermarket equivalent of Ryanair,"Service at checkout is rushed, impersonal and downright rude. The lack of customer acknowledgment and service brings to mind that of Ryanair.

Aldi UK,Not good,"Went to Aldi in Rock ferry/Port-sunlight this evening and it was manic! At the tills a voice called ""go to number 5"", so some people left the queue they were in and went to 5, we stayed were we were, til 2, despite there being 2 people with full trollies in front. Then another voice says til 1, so we went.... would have been good if the cashier was there waiting and ready.............. oh no.....we had to wait for him to come, THEN wait for him to take stuff off the seat so he could sit, then when i came to pay by card, he went to another til! Did he apologize? NO..........did he explain he had to sort something at another til? NO! so as I had put my card in I could not proceed to pay as he hadn't 'pressed the button'................ so we waited, and waited, and waited, it seems another customer agreed with me that they should not shout out til numbers when no one is there! Once back he pressed the button...THEN he tells ME to put my number in........ER I had!!!!!!! The man, I think it was the manager as he had a shirt on, was rude, arrogant and his attitude was not as it should be. Maybe he needs to go on a People Matter course and a Customer Care one.",0,1
Aldi UK,horrible customer service,"After all the ads on tv and saying it was best supermarket blahblah thought id try out aldi Paisley (fulbar road) Scotland for the family shop. Going round the products are good, good range of choices for a cheaper supermaket, even a few brand names. However, get to the checkout and lets say service with a smile isnt their thing. Woman sat like a robot, didnt offer to help even though struggling with a toddler. Was sighing as things started to pile up at one side. I hadnt even finished paying and she was scanning the next persons products. She was on to the next after that before i had my bags up. And just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady, i was actually getting things together pretty fast. I will NOT be shopping here again, EVER. If people worked like that in any other supermarket they'd be sacked. Horrible dire faced woman. Now off to check sellby dates on stuff after reading reviews. Very disappointed.",0,1
Aldi UK,Is this the Worlds worst supermarket?,"The food is Aldi is of very low quality, although, don't get me wrong, you can get some nice tomatoes from there, and the pineapples are more than acceptable, but the rest isn't really satisfactory. The apples are sour (I even had one that had somehow gone mouldy inside), the ham looks like it's never looked over a pig sty in its entire existence and as for the, let's face it, copied brands such as Norpak instead of Lurpak for example, they are just awful and it infuriates me even more that they copy that packaging almost to the letter, and the send out an add with people (or actors, which ever term you would prefer) saying that they like them just as much. And saying that they taste the same.If that was even close to the truth then wouldn't the makers of the REAL brand be fighting to get to Aldi's recipe?! Another reason I dislike Aldi is the shopping experience, the staff have to do everything with speed in mind, that's why Aldi is so cheap, but as a result the staff are just plain rude and unhelpful, when I was in the store I asked a member of staff if they knew whether they had something in (on one of the 'Special Buys'), I got told, ""I don't know."" And the staff member continued with what they were doing.Overall, the food is NOT of satisfactory quality, the staff are unhelpful, the shop isn't a pleasant place to be and the whole shopping experience just isn't a nice one at all.And also, when Aldi say they have won 'Which? Best Supermarket 2013', they really haven't, Waitrose has, look on the Which? website if you don't believe m.And it just so happens that Waitrose is my favourite shop, - their food is flavoursome and palatable, they're shops are clean and tidy, the staff are so friendly and helpful and it's a nice shopping experience.I'm not a snob (if you don't believe that then just note [for example] that I shop in other 'budget shops', such as Primark as they're clothes are more than acceptable), I'm just someone who knows quality when they see it, and in Aldi, I don't",0,1
Aldi UK,worst customer service,I went today in Aldi Rockdale and tried to return three bottles of Olive Leaf Extract.The reason i suffer from sugar dietetic on the label there was misleading information that the item did not have any artificial sweeteners and did not have sugar contents.So i took the items in the store the Store Manager Nicole came and told me i need to have a receipt and the item was on sale 3 weeks ago she said to me that the only way i can got my money back if i give her the exact time of purchase date and time and minute . How can anyone remember stupid STORE MANAGER NICOLE SO I THROUGH THE THINGS IN THE STORE AND LEFT Very bad service,0,1
Aldi UK,terrible experience,"went to return a food item today, was treated like a piece of dirt, refused a refund because I did not have my receipt, despite the fact that the item in the pack was not what the label said it was. the manageress said I was being aggressive and basically a liar, even though I never swore or raised my voice once. IT'S TRUE- they will do anything to avoid dealing with your complaint and get you out of the store. Customer Service appalling. Im going next door to Tesco!",0,1
Aldi UK,Gillingham store,I just been refused to buy alcohol in Gillingham store because I had EU driving license and that was something new for me as I never had any problems in this store before.

Aldi UK,"Quite good overall, but be aware of ""improved"" products.","We use Aldi quite a lot for generally a good standard of products at a fair price, but get annoyed when basic products just disappear for a few weeks (or longer), sometimes being replaced by an inferior recipe. One at present concerns Fruit Teas. The Diplomat Berry Fruits tea rightfully won some awards and has been my brew of choice for several years. Recently after a brief absence this reappeared in a new, slightly larger box, and the new product tastes frankly awful. A sweet, chemically nothing, with no ""berry"" flavour. A quick comparison of ingredients shows a considerable reduction in the good stuff, which probably explains the lack of flavour. I will return the rest of the box, and look elsewhere for a replacement",0,3
Aldi UK,Dates are essential,"So I went to aldi to do a bit of shopping, not the supermarket I choose every week as I like to shop around. I have been here a few times and thought it was good value for some product but not others.The tinned and packet things you can't really go wrong with, however the fresh food, well that's a big let down. I had filled my trolly with all the bits I wanted and decided I had enough, while unloading onto the conveyor I notice that some of the food was passed it sell by date, and passed it by like a week. These products consisted of: yogurts for my kids, cheese, salad, ham, quiche and chicken breasts. I mentioned this to the lady on the checkout, I was gobbed smacked by her response. 'well what do you expect for cheap food, just freeze it or eat it today, the date only mean we can't sell it but its still eatable. I did of course show my utter disgust to her and make her get me some that had a least 3 days date on them. She on the other hand was not impressed that I had done this.I was so shocked that I thought well if this is the attitude of the staff no wonder they don't know how to stock rotation. Not sure I will want to shop here anymore, God knows how ill this could of made my kids and me.Maybe the staff need some extra training or the store needs to be consistent with the food standards agency",0,3
Aldi UK,Cheap prices horrible customer service especially from HEAD OFFICE,"During a visit to Aldi Bedworth i purchased some strawberries and a pint of milk. When i got home and opened the strawberries i noticed that they were all moldy and rotting. When i decided to pour my son a glass of milk out came this slimy brown something from the pint of milk which looked horrible. I took the milk and strawberries back to the shop which for me is 2 buses away, obviously when i went back i had the milk, the strawberries and the receipt but when i got there they refused to give me a refund or replace the milk and strawberries despite me having a receipt they told me that it was ""OUT OF THEIR HANDS"" and that i should contact HEAD OFFICE, they gave me a number to call which funnily enough is the only number available for Aldi, this number is for recruitment, inquiries and apparently complaints. So i called the HEAD OFFICE and they told me they were going to open up a case assured me it would be dealt with and someone would contact me within 3-5 days, it has now been 2 months and nothing from Aldi. I had a second incident where i called HEAD OFFICE since this is the only number available to call, I called to find out if my local Aldi in Nuneaton had any heaters available, after waiting 20 minutes to get through to someone and then being cross questioned over what my query was about i finally got transferred to the store where they confirmed they had 22 heaters in stock. It was about 8pm and i was at work so I asked my wife to take a walk to buy 2 for the house, she went with our 3 year old son as our heater stopped working, it was cold but she wrapped our son warm in his buggy and off to ALDI she went. When she got there they told her that they had no heaters in stock, obviously HEAD OFFICE had transferred our call to the wrong store. I called to express my displeasure and was told they would open up a case and someone would contact me in 3-5 days, it has now been 2 weeks and nothing from Aldi. Do not waste your time launching a complaint with Aldi they will only treat you like a nuisance and probably cut off your calls as they did mine when i called to follow up on the complaints, the woman on the other end of the phone told me i was breaking up and then the phone went dead...LOL...A few of my friends advised me to contact the Office Of Fair Trading Standards, which i have and they have assured me that it will be resolved.",0,1
Aldi UK,Warning!! Don't shop here if you have kids!,"A terrible place to shop with kids. No customer toilets and my local store has a 1.5 hour parking limit, not enough time if the kids need the toilet and you have to leave the store to find public toilets. Not to mention any tantrums and the stress of trying to get back to the car in time - when the kids were finally strapped in the car I had to take a long walk round the car park to calm my nerves.I got sent a parking fine for £70 a week later, thanks Aldi but I'd rather pay the extra at another supermarket and come home less stressed and without a parking fine.",0,1

Would like to see more in the way of cat food though, like whiskas or felix as we have 4 cats and love both of these. We could then do all our weekly shop just at Aldi. So Aldi if you read this, push it a bit more please.",0,4
Aldi UK,Disappointing!!!!!,"I went to Aldi shop (Luton) for the first time and I will say I WON'T go there ever again. I have a very young baby and decided to stock up on wipes and other baby products. When I got to the till, the staff said they couldn't sell me all the wipes because I had taken all their stock. What?!!!!!! The items are there to be bought and I think it's the responsibility of the seller to always have items in stock (be it on their shelves or in their warehouse) I took about 30 packs of wipes in all as that is how I always purchased items, with two very young kids and not enough time to always go to the supermarket. Unfortunately they didn't have them in boxes. The staff called another colleague of his who came and loudly exclaimed I wouldn't be allowed to take all the wipes. They took everything away rudely and left just four wipes and said I would only be allowed to buy those. I was shocked and was really mad. I honestly felt like crying. I told them I didn't want the wipes any more and just paid for the other items I bought. They told me that if I want that much quantity, I will have to place an order and pick them up in a couple of days. I agreed to do so reluctantly after being treated that way. The gentleman I was directed to asked me to wait so he speaks to someone about the processing of my order. I waited for 10mins and he wasn't coming. I had a screaming baby and a tired toddler, I couldn't wait any longet after such treatment. To be honest, it wasn't not the best experience especially on my first visit to the shop and I don't think I will ever set foot there any more. I'm very very disappointed.",0,1
Aldi UK,ALDI BENTLEY BRIDGE WEDNESFIELD WOLVERHAMPTON  AWFUL SERVICE,went in the store sunday 22sep around 12.30 lengthy queues at checkouts went one to be told in a rude manner I am closed dumped shopping and found the duty manager he couldn't have cared less not the first time this ahs happened in this store overall the staff in there aren't particulary pleasant I suggest if Aldi do any courses on customer service the wednesfield store gets an invite,0,1
Aldi UK,Need to learn about customer service,Been shopping this morning at Blackwater store. I now appreciate all the comments concerning lack of customer service. I don't know why they were voted best supermarket for 2012? Their is a poster promising to open another checkout if you are waiting past a certain point. Multiple queues past this point today but no additional checkout opened! I was served by the Assistant Manager who did not utter a word of apology for breaking the advertised promise. Stacked pallets in the aisles made it dangerous and impassable at times for customers. This was 9.15 a.m so clearly inadequate night shift to avoid this. Not surprising when recruiting ads in the store offer half the average national wage for doing this work. How can people live on that in this area?,0,3
Aldi UK,Unfriendly staff - Aldi Shipley,"I find some of the staff rather customer unfriendly and off putting. If you bring your own bags or a box, they will search them to check for stolen goods I presume. it is also difficult to find someone to help as they seem so busy rushing boxes in and out. I think one think to ask the staff at the cashiers is to look and smile at the customers.If they don't change their ways, customers will not return despite being cheaper than some other supermarkets.",0,2
Aldi UK,jumble sale,"I like Aldi but you have to watch some of the prices.Also you just get used to a product and inexplicably they drop it.Also my store in Fleetwood is a bit like a jumble sale,and pallets are left all over the place,which hinders trolleys and quite dangerous for shoppers.",0,4
Aldi UK,Good in a cash shortage!,"I love, love comparing how much money you can save on similar products when you have spent a long time shopping at other supermarkets. Also the mix of food choice if generally good for a cheaper store (as long as you are prepared to try a few new things) However, there are always a few things you need to go back to your normal supermarket for - which is a hassle. For me it is gluten free food... admittedly, my nutritional needs are awkward - but once you have to shop elsewhere - even if you are saving money, that is a major hassle. They have 'copied' many traditional cereals and so on. This is a hit and miss experiment, but you can cope, if you want to save money. Sometimes the salt content is raised to cover for lack of other flavour? Also on 2 recent trips at 2 different stores the card machines were not working... apparently the managers do not bother to get them fixed unless the staff complain repeatedly. Then the staff don't bother complaining as they know the managers will not get it fixed - vicious circle - with a bored irate customer standing in the middle! Will I continue to go? Yes, when I want to save money, but have PLENTY of time to stand at the till. Still I give them 4 stars for helping me out in a financial crisis and for the food being palatable enough, even for me and my fussy eaters. If I could give 1 advice to Aldi - please sort out the ability to pay.",0,4
Aldi UK,Same old hurl it down,"New Aldi in Westbury Wiltshire, good value for money, difficult to find items, my pet hate is children with goodness knows what on their shoes allowed to stand in trolleys, only been open a week and the empty trolleys full of empty packaging. My main complaint is that the shopping was hurled down at us at the checkout, some of it fell on the floor, no offer of a replacement. Despite complaining the operator continued to ignore our request to slow down. Economically we have to shop there at least for a while. I think it may be desirable to stop the checkout and request to see the manager.",0,3
Aldi UK,Quality and price OK; service and organisation hopeless,"You spend 15 minutes shopping and then 40 minutes queueing. Checkouts are not fully staffed and those that are, are really slow. And if you ask for a particular product you can't find, you'll be told, ""It's over there somewhere - I think.""If something is out of stock, don't bother asking when it'll be back. You get, ""Sometime next week - maybe 2 weeks."" They don't seem to have delivery schedules.I now regard all this as the non-financial ""costs"" of shopping at Aldi.",0,3
Aldi UK,"Unwelcoming, Unfriendly Shop !","I recently visited the Scarborough Store where I had the most horrible shopping experience. Firstly someone (shop assistants or manager) decided it would be a great idea to start moving the specials cages about whilst the shop was very busy, this is a very small shop and not comfortable to walk around at the best of times. After our game of Dodgems with other customers and staff with specials cages we began the next hideous game of hell at the checkout. We emptied our trolley onto the belt in a sensible order, frozen and heavy first, lighter easily ruined items last. The girl at the till very abruptly nagged at us to turn our trolley round at the other end of the till. I then committed the ultimate crime and packed my frozen food into my ready and waiting bag (never, ever do this) - the response from the extremely rude till operator ""just put your stuff straight into the trolley and pack it after"" and then the worst game began everything was shoved through at break-neck speed and so it was a case of catch your shopping and throw it in the trolley before it ends up on the floor. My shopping ended up in a total mess and it took ages to sort and pack it all after. I will never use a trolley in there ever again, if I do attempt to shop in Aldi it will only ever be for a few items at a time that I can catch quickly enough at the till to bag.I did manage to contact head office and the area manager phoned to apologise for the rude staff, but said that the checkout system is their policy to try and help keep down queues at the checkout and make it quicker for you to leave the shop. It certainly does not help you leave the shop quicker - unpack your trolley, repack your trolley, unpack your trolley, pack your bags !! How come a helpful shop like Iceland can scan your shopping and place it straight into a bag and you are out within minutes ?So Aldi - Swap & Save. More like Swap & Waste - unless you are skilled in the game of catch your shopping before it lands in a heap on the floor you may very well waste the money you have saved on crumpled, damaged products. Cheaper Prices seems to be at the expense of poor, rude service.",0,1
Aldi UK,I saved half my grocery money,"I have used Aldi on and off over the years.Reason i dident use it as often before was simple,distance.We now have a local one and I saved half of my usual cost of £50.I love the fact its my choice if I buy non branded.I usually buy value packs,and economical priced products anyway.I used to use Tesco.",0,5
Aldi UK,Cheque for warranty items never materialise,"Purchase 2 Delta Induction Hotplates around April 2011 from local Aldi, which came with 3 years warranty. Both broke down a year later. When reported it to their after sales support, I was told the product is no longer in production, and a pro-rata refund will be given, this was around middle of 2012. Waited a month or two, phoned them for the progress,was told a cheque is on the way. On 7/12/2012, rang them again, a person by the name of Bob answer the call, and assured me a cheque is being prepared, should get it within a week or so. Cheque did not materialise, rang again on 28/1/2013, David answered the call, same story repeated. on 14/3/2013, rang them again, this time I was given a job. no. 862243, still no sign of the cheque. By this time, I have spent quite a bit on phone calls to contact them, is this how Aldi trade? Perhaps an Aldi rep. can explain?Also visit local store after doing the above, I am still waiting for the phone call.",0,1
Aldi UK,Stop whining!,"I do wish those shoppers who expect John Lewis service at Aldi prices would shut up! I'm perfectly prepared to put my shopping straight into the trolley and put it into bags at my leisure once beyond the till - what's so difficult about that? I would have thought that would be more sensible than struggling to keep up with the checkout at Tesco, etc, Perhaps Aldi should think about putting up notices explaining what to expect once you reach the till, so that shoppers know what to expect.As for surly, disinterested staff, there are staff like this in all supermarkets if you look for them! I have to say that the checkout staff at the Aldi branch at Ely are usually very pleasant.",0,4
Aldi UK,How to get a diploma as a customer at Aldi,"Having visited Aldi at Long Eaton as a customer, I should draw attention to Rules to be observed by the customer. You should be very honoured to step inside this shop, after all this chain of shops been voted the tops by Which magazine so they can afford to be rude and quite dismissive of the pest that shops in there. No one rule do not disturb the sales assistant that is standing in front of you talking to his friend, who has kindly come to visit him, you just have to wait to until he moves out of the way so you can get to the product you want,No two rule Do not under any circumstance ask if a product can be reduced because it is damaged, they would rather throw it awayNo three Rule whilst at till if the cashier decides she wants a break whilst putting your things through the check out and she wanders of without any word of explanation just wait patiently, bring your knitting if you wish,do not expect an apology when she returnsNo four Rule do not under any circumstance, even if you are new to this try and pack your bags at the check out, you will have the goods passed to you at break neck speed, it will become a game of who can throw the quickestNo 5 Rule contradicts no four Rule if you have a basket you will have that removed and the food is still thrown at you, but this time you have nowhere to throw it No 6 Rule You are invisible to the cashier as they have other things on their mind and they love talking to their colleagues on the other tills, I still do not know how they can put thing through the check out when their heads are turned the other way, quite clever really, after all you are just nuisance to them.and finallyGreat food shame about the service",0,1
Aldi UK,checkout nightmare for elderly.,"this morning i was requested to assist my 79 year old mother to do the weekly shop in Aldi in Clonmel,Co.Tipperary.The reason i state her age is that she has,within the last fortnight just left hospital for the second time and underwent serious surgery for cancer.We arrived at the check out,and waited while two extra till staff were summoned to deal with a large queue.This was a Friday morning at 10.30,and only one till being operated! Anyway after a patient wait the nightmare kicked in.The conveyer belt full of our purchases was canon balled by the cashier through the till where i was waiting to pack our own bags.I was told to place the trolley in its allocated place and throw the food into it instead.At this point i asked the cashier to slow down and wait,wondering to myself how even an able bodied person just could not tolerate or cope with this dismissive behavior.The reply from the cashier to my request was that I had to put up with this service as it was the ""PRICE I HAD TO PAY FOR CHEAP FOOD"".Well to say I was gobsmacked would be an understatement.Needless to say I shall not let my Mother run the gauntlet of rude,under trained,and totally ignorant staff again in a hurry.It seems that this is a well reported and complained about scenario,and unfortunately there seems to be no place on the Aldi website to lodge my complaint.Am I surprised.Ha!!",0,1
Aldi UK,terrible service,"Ok Aldi is good value, but after a week working, you do not go shopping on Friday evening to be spoken to like a naughty schoolboy by some jumped up checkout operator. My first offence was placing (actually securely wedging ) my wine bottle in an upright position , followed closely by the travesty of leaving my basket at the other end of the belt, as I wasn't allowed to bag my 7 items straight into a carrier bag! For both I was spoken to in a rude, nasty and contemptuous tone. When I pointed out I wasn't used to being so rudely spoken to there was no apology, just ""the store manager is over there if you want to complain!"" I am now going back to m and s, it costs only slightly more and as a paying customer with a choice I'm always afforded the respect and appreciation for my custom.",0,1
Aldi UK,Management are rude and dont know what they are doing.,"I work for them so heres the low down on them, and i have worked in several aldi stores and its the same in all of them.They leave frozen and chilled delivery out in the open for hours while they work it, and when they have finished the delivery they put the defrosted or warm products back into the freezer or chiller.You don't get all of your breaks, alot of the times you dont get a break, and if you do get a break and the store gets busy they make you sit on the till. The management talk to you like your a piece of shit, they act friendly to your face but they slag you off behind your back, they have slagged off other staff members to my face and i am just a store assistant so what does that tell you about the people who work there and the company itself. They dont pay you correctly, when they ask you to stay behind when your shift has finished, call you in early or ask you to come in on your day off, they dont put your extra hours down on the computer, they ""forget"" to do it so their ""prod"" looks better, if you ask to see the hours you have done they will try to put it off or they will show you, put your hours on, then when you have gone out of the office they will take the hours off. When your on the tills you have to work out the change for the customer in your head even though the till can work it out for you, yet they expect your till to be spot on when they cash you up. They make you work 11 to 15 hour shifts then expect you to start work at 6am the next morning. The area managers turn a blind eye to all these things, they are not stupid they choose not to do anything about it. and if you go to them with a problem about someone especially if they are management, they wont believe you, they will always take the side of the management. They are not big on health and safety, and the safety of the staff dont cross the managements minds.If your injured and you cant work they wont believe you and will slag you off, they dont care for your wellbeing. They expect you to be in the store 15 mins before your shift starts and to work straight away yet they wont pay you for it, then when you finish your shift at 8PM or 9 pm when the store closes they expect you to clean the store, the tills and staffroom and to be out by 9.15 pm the latest, but if you get out of the store by 9.30 pm they will only pay you till 9pm, the only way they will pay you when you work past 9pm is when you get out of the store by 9.45 or later.The management expect you to do nothing on your day off, not to have a life and to sit by the phone waiting for them to call you for extra hours, once you get your hours for the week, you like millions of other workers may actually make plans on your days off or when you finish work, and when the management ask you to do extra hours and you say no as you have made plans to do something they will be pissed off with you, they wont see your side of it, so when it comes to working bank holidays which is double pay, they wont put you down to work it and they will make you work all your shifts for the week until the store closes. so if you have a wife, girlfriend or you have someone who relies on you, expect your relationship to suffer, They put everyone who works in the store apart from the assistant manager and store manager, on a basic hours on their contracts, some are contracted to a minimum of 6 hours, some are on a minimum of 18 hours, so anything you do above this you will be thankful for, so say for example you are contracted to 18 hours and one week they make you work 25 hours, the next week they will give you 11 hours or less and will say as you did 25 hours that week it works out the same, yet the extra hours you do is overtime so how they work out that they can give you less hours thats on your contract i dont know.when you are on the till you have to scan the products really fast as they monitor your speed and you have to hit speed targets which have been set, i once was serving a customer who only has the use of one arm, she didnt buy too much for herself so i thought i would pack the shopping for her, but when i did this and she walked off a member of management told me off, this person said i should't have done that, even when i explained that the customer only had the use of one arm this didnt make a difference, so if your disabled or old and you struggle to put the shopping into your trolly fast enough or struggle to put your shopping into your shopping bag, bottom line is aldi dont care",0,1

I tend to buy the items on special offer and I certainly do not go for the sunny disposition of its female staff. (hatchet faced streaks of misery would not be exaggeration.)Today (Easter monday morning) was especially badGenerally I find that the checkout girls, (not lads ), are some of the most sullen, rude unhelpful people I've met and wonder if Aldi seek them out.

He then denied it, AND banned me from the store... yet I was in the right!

Aldi UK,Unhelpful customer service!,"I bought a twin pack of Ballycastle Hot Toddy from my local Aldi and discovered that the ingredients are described as "" a warming sweet hot toddy blended with smooth triple distilled Irish whiskey infused with lemon and spice flavours"". However as there is no list of ingredients I phoned Aldi to ask whether there is added sugar or honey.(this is pretty important if you're diabetic!). The customer adviser clearly thought this was a highly amusing question and informed me between giggles that she had no idea! After putting my call on hold for a long time, she then said there was nobody available to provide the information. She took my number and promised that someone would call me on Monday. I shall await the call with interest, but I do feel that the ingredients should be listed on the product in the first place.",0,3
Aldi UK,Can't fault the price and mix of product,At the Linlithgow Branch there are only a couple of assistants/managers who seem happy to help the customer.

Aldi UK,Worst Customer Service EVERRRR - 3rd experience !,"I use Aldi Weymouth at least 3 times a week, I have found the staff to be rushed/ curt in their assistance. However, there are certain items that are much cheaper than other stores & I regularly visit the store for this reason only. The tills are designed so that you pack your goods on the ""till feeder"", then you pack them back into the trolley, QUICKLY - as you're made to feel you're holding ""them"" up - then you take the goods to a packing shelf, to pack in packets. I mentioned to the cashies that this system is very stressful for their customers, to be told that they beat TESCO for speed @ the tills??? At whose expense I ask? This afternoon, I saw an elderly lady panicking, trying to pack her goods, at the till - once again I told the cashier that Aldi's ""till system"" should be revised,( hoping she would bring it up in a staff meeting). She told me that Aldi offer cheap prices & I should SHOP ELSEWHERE if I didn't like it! I have NEVER been treated in this manner in my life - can't believe it!!!

Aldi UK,good,cant understand the labels on most of the products but they are cheap and fair quality,0,3
Aldi UK,Good! And one idea..!,"As you seem to own Traders Joe in the US, why not giving us (in Europe) part of their outstanding smart and unique products????",0,4
Aldi UK,Great Prices,Why go to tesco and pay more,0,5
Aldi UK,Interesting good quality foods,"The food is usually good quality, but not always available. I have several items that I bought, loved and never saw again. Very annoying. I would not recomend this store to an elderly person as they throw the goods at you on the checkout and then you have to pack it in bags afterwards. All a bit of a rush. You load the trolley, then put it on the checkout, then load it in the trolley, then load it in the bags, then the car and then unpack it all at home. A Lot of work, but if you are young and fit and like to check out all the offers (different ones each week) give Aldi a go.",0,4
Aldi UK,"Food, drink and more",What would you do without them? Great prices on food and drink. Some hardware I would do without but its a choice for everyone not just the individual.,0,4
Aldi UK,poor customer service,"staff are unhelpful, arrogant and fed up! managers are even worst.",0,2
Aldi UK,"Always great value, amazing offers on some unusual items.",Aldi is worth visiting just to see the wide range of goods on offer. Basic food items are highly competitive and the selection of unknown brands enhances the shopping experience. On rare occasions when I have not found unknown brands to be as good as expected they have refunded/exchanged without any fuss. Their particular strength is in everyday groceries at affordable prices. Occasional big ticket purchases are the icing on the cake.,0,5
Aldi UK,Need a little more info on website,"Make sure you update your website offers as fara in advance as possible, and possibly (a la aldi.com.au) put your grocery prices so even if we can't order online we can compare. Other than that, brilliant store, occasional problems with goods (usually incorrectly stored cold items like cheese) which can be a bit annoying but accept this and save money as it's on the way home!",0,5
Aldi UK,Great products and great service.,I shop regularly at Aldi because of their great prices and the quality of their food. Their chickens are the best I have had for a long time and have recommended them to many of my friends. It doesn't matter how busy the shop is the assistants are always pleasant and they make you boring grocery shopping much easier. They have free carparking and the whole experience is great.,0,5
Aldi UK,Wish they would have more information,"I find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell, only information on the special offers",0,3
Aldi UK,Excellent,Great company.,0,5
Aldi UK,Excellent uncomplicated value,"Discovered Aldi last year for food saved lots of money and the products are good. Ambience is not a factor here, would go to Waitrose when looking for a longer shopping trip. Aldi saves time with a small store footprint and I estimate a cost saving of 20% over major supermarket stores. This Aldi shopper also likes the Co-op.",0,5
Aldi UK,Aldi,"Very good for some items which you cannot find any where else, but these are usually seasonal so not always available.Have bought milk on more than one occasion which goes sour before the use-by date on the carton.",0,3
Aldi UK,Excellent Value and Quality,Aldi does such good quality product but at great prices - so much better than Tesco's - its also possible to do a weekly shop in 20mins rather than a painful hour it takes to get round Tesco. I buy all my basics here and then a few special bits from M&S - highly recommend!!,0,5
Aldi UK,Good value for money on some items.,I like sporting equipment from Aldi as well as car tools.,0,5
Aldi UK,Great value supermarket,"Aldi are fab supermarket , even people with money go there because their food is good and even if you don't know their brand , try it as it's as good as leading brands , always will shop there..........",0,5
Aldi UK,"good price, excellent quality!","Fresh fruit and vegetables everyday, very good selection of cheese, frozen fish, meals ... yum",0,5
Aldi UK,"Quality, clean and good value shopping","Aldi is always clean and tidy and stocks fresh, good quality produce. The Aldi brand goods are as good as the branded items and at better prices. I regularly buy some of Aldi's special purchases that have been of good quality and at good prices. On the rare occasions that I have had a problem with goods, the store has replaced them or refunded the money without a quibble.",0,5
Aldi UK,ALDI,IS CHEAP AND CHEERFULL,0,4
Aldi UK,Memories,I love Aldi. It reminds meof my childhood as we had Aldi shops in Germany where I grew up. So it reminds me of shopping with my mother. They provide good value for money.,0,5
Aldi UK,5 * all the way,Quality of products and service is excellent,0,5
Aldi UK,Love Aldi :),Love Aldi. Love the prices...love the smiley staff :) Keep up the good work Aldi :),0,5
Aldi UK,excellent,".cheap good quality food. Easy to park. When I had a problem with a purchase, the manager came to my house to sort it out. Unfortunately also have to shop elsewhere for groceries as do not carry everything I need. Fruit and vegetables do not last as long as some supermarkets but Ok as long as you realise this",0,5
Aldi UK,Great products but untidy shops,Like many people I've switched my main grocery shop to Aldi to make my money stretch further. On the whole I'm happy with the products and certainly there a few gems to be discovered but sometimes the shops are rather untidy which could put off potential new customers.,0,4
Aldi UK,Good service,Fresh food at affordable prices and fast delivery. I am very satisfied with this service.,0,5
Aldi UK,No help,Good prices but no help in the shops for disabled people like me- no scooters and no seats at the checkout. No help packing,0,3
Aldi UK,Five star,Exceptionally good value and everything I buy is just as good as sainsbury if not better !,0,5
Aldi UK,just wish,great place to shop with unusual and inexpensive deals but i just wish they had a delivery service,0,3
Aldi UK,You can check for all the latest Offers from Aldi on this site,It is worth looking on this site for their Offers - you will not believe some of the prices!!,0,5
Aldi UK,Great products at great prices,May not know the brand but the quality is good. The prices are excellent and a very diverse array of products.. the staff are quite helpful too,0,5
Aldi UK,Love it,"I get most of my shopping from Aldi, most of their own brand products are better and cheaper that named brands, and they have really good bargains too.",0,5
Aldi UK,Aldi,"My local Aldi Store in sunderland offers exceptional value for money. The staff are easy to talk to, and help in almost anyway they can. With money being tight over the past few years, I chose to swap the normal hyper market that I used to shop at, and chose Aldi due to the reduced Prices on like for like items.I save approx £60 per week this way, and my family are more than happy with the variety of items I purchase there.If your looking to save money on your Food and Drink shopping, Aldi is the place to be.",0,5
Aldi UK,VERY GOOD FOR PRICES,Allthough Aldi is very good for prices there could be more recognised brands.,0,5
Aldi UK,"spend a litle,  you know the rest:)","i think its about time aldi built another store here in plymouth.we have about 6 lidl stores and one aldi, sometimes they are a bit understaffed but i must admit the staff are always freindly,only on one occasion have i complained good quality and great prices",0,5
Aldi UK,Top draw,"Nice to see Aldi giving Tesco, etc a run for their money",0,5
Aldi UK,Just a bit different from the usual bunch,"I have shopped at aldi for a number of years, mainly for the tool bargains which also carry a 3 year warranty. Important to keep your receipts though, as I have just had my router pack up, and I have lost the receipt on moving house.I now live in Devon, and unfortunately the nearest store is 12 miles away in Exeter - both of them.",0,4
Aldi UK,The reputation preceeds them - and you never know what you will find.,Cracking fresh veg - some of the unknown brands are better than the original product at half the price - always enjoy a cruise around Aldi!,0,5
Aldi UK,Brilliant,"Fruit and veg are really fresh, you get your moneys worth and good quality. Really good prices and really fresh produce highly reccomend although some foods do taste cheap but not as many as you would think such as the rice snaps are just like rice crispies",0,4
Aldi UK,WHY PAY MORE??,NOW THAT WEVE FOUND YOU WE WONT LET YOU GO!!YOUVE GOT US SINGING A SONG!!!,0,5
Aldi UK,shopping,get many a bargain in here but would not do a weekly shop here,0,5
Aldi UK,Good Quality,"Was always a little suspicious of buying from Aldi, but recently have tried quite a few of their brands, and to be honest, they are really good. Will use them quite often from now on.",0,5
Aldi UK,soap tablets,of all that I have in my 67 years thers are the best and as I am disabled the aer all ways there to help me in store,0,5
Aldi UK,staff need to be friendly,"I shop at Aldi in Shipley Bradford every now and again and love the surprising extra one off items you can find. However the cheaper shopping experience should NOT out way a friendly and welcoming staff, I know they're busy and want you through asap, but being rushed by unfriendly staff will put me off returning.",0,3
Aldi UK,Great for some stuff.,Some stuff like their chocolate is better & cheaper than most brands.Impossible to do a full shop due to limited range but great for stocking up on certain items. Have to be careful as prices are not always cheaper and they constantly reduce pack size/design whilst keeping the same price (or adding 10p here and there).,0,4
Aldi UK,Prices should be cheaper than any other supermarket,"I do use Aldi, occasionally and only when their product prices are lower than any other supermarket (which they should be) and not compare their prices with other supermarkets who allow you to pay with credit cards as they are a ""cash only"" company.",0,1
Aldi UK,Dishwasher tablets excellent value NO STARS,"The above is the only good thing to be said,everything about this store is disgusting,the staff are the lowest of the low,as is the atmosphere and quality of the premises.",0,1
Aldi UK,Update,Now doing a weekly shop. Great Burgundy wines. Need I say more?,0,5
Aldi UK,Parking Eye at Aldi (or anywhere else!),"Aldi use Parking Eye to monitor many of their car parks. Don't fall for paying them!Parking Eye have no authority to level a charge for parking, over the time or not - or even if you don't shop at Aldi. They obtain the name of the registered keeper from DVLA, write to you with an officious Parking Charge Notice and then bully you with at least 3 more letters. You can only be liable for making a Contract if you make that contract - simply ignoring the 'contract' proffered on their notices is not making a contract. In any event only the driver at the time could possibly be liable - and he or she might or might not not be the driver - you are not obliged to tell these bombastic fools anything! So, DO NOT 'PHONE THEM - OR WRITE TO THEM - OR APPEAL TO THEM - ABOVE ALL DO NOT PAY THEM - THEY WILL GO AWAY! -Eventually! Google - Parking Charge Notice - and read all about it. But if you get a PENALTY Charge Notice then that will be from the local Council - ignore that at your peril!",0,1
Aldi UK,Great for cheaper grocery shopping,"these stores are great for cheaper grocery shopping, however they still have not got a full range of groceries in store as other stores have, hence the four stars.",0,4
Aldi UK,Great offers,"Great offers each week via email news letter,Allway got interesting items in storeAll round Value for money",0,5

Aldi UK,Hello,very pretty stuff its really easy thanks so much,0,5
Aldi UK,Not cheaper,"Aldi is not cheaper than other supermarkets, best to keep shopping in your usual store to pick up the bargains...",0,1
Aldi UK,Great,Love Aldi great food at great prices,0,5
Aldi UK,Quality products not brands,"Once you get over the lack of familiar brand names you'll be amazed at the value and quality. The prices are low but the quality is high, especially the continental stock. Forget whether you need 2 for 1 comparisons or whether 1/2 price is really the real price, Aldi just do low prices for great quality across the range. Plus there's the benefit of 'either they have it or they don't' ethos rather than choose between 10 varieties of the same thing at the big 4. I guess their buying power benefits their customers as well.",0,5
Aldi UK,Aldi in Germany,"Aldi in Germany is a terrific place to shop, and it's gotten better since a decade or so ago. Aldi now carries many Bio products (organic) and a terrific variety of produce at hard-to-beat prices. I've lately been buying eggplant (aubergine) for between 40 and 80 euro cents each, while they cost at least a euro more at Edeka or Tengelmann.There are also good prices on a good brand of make-up, on a number of Italian food items. candy, lots of bread selections and on wine and hard spirits. When they have specials on electronics and home and garden items, one can save a bundle of money over the price in a store like Globus or MediaMarkt or the Bauhaus.",0,5
Aldi UK,great prices and range.,"Aldi like Lidl are getting more and more of market share maybe becuase they price their goods to make a profit but not one as ridiculous as Tesco , we all have tio eat and they make it possible at sensible prices plus sell tools,cloyhes etc.",0,5
Aldi UK,brilliant,excellent value,0,5
Aldi UK,Great prices,Really great prices for food that is in the most the same type of food you can buy anywhere else and pay lots more for.,0,4
Aldi UK,aldi,staff could be a bit more friendly especialy on the tills or is it because its a no frills kinda place?,0,3
Aldi UK,ALDI is fantastic for service and prices!,"Expect a warm and friendly welcome when you go into your ALDI, and they don't hovver over you. They will chat nicely with you, if that's what you want, otherwise you are left in peace to shop at your leisure... and yet they are always willing to help if you need it. The stock is fresh and interesting, with new product lines always coming in. The fruit and veg is always fresh and much of the stock comes as great value for money. You can get most things from ALDI, you don't need to line the pockets of the larger and much pricier supermarket chains. Well done ALDI!!",0,5
Aldi UK,Excellent Products and good value !,"I am shopping to Aldi regularily and I think it is an excellent company. Finished the mind blowing range you can find at Tesco where you end up buying more than you need. With Aldi, you go straight to the point, and the selection of product you find is tasty enough for me!Well done!",0,5
Aldi UK,"Love Food, Love Aldi, Love the Price!","Hard to beat Aldi on the price of anything, we get all our food from Aldi and have always been happy with the quality over the whole range. Their weekly specials (Twice weekly actually) are always brilliant and if they have something in short supply on special, it is worth getting up early and getting in the queue!",0,5
Aldi UK,Quality goods,"i have found the range of food in Aldi to be good and reasonably price and with there specials days they have, you can be sure to get a bargin, staff are always friendly and helpful and i save money which is good as everything has gone up/",0,4
Aldi UK,catching up fast quality,a quality company catching tesco up quick converted i am highly reccomended,0,5
Aldi UK,All round excellent,There has never been a time when I have had a bad customer service experience with Aldi. They excell in all areas of customer service and satisfaction. They have some amazing bargains on quality items.,0,5
Aldi UK,Excellent,Their rang of product is very good as is the quality and price.I have done our major weekly shop at Aldi since they opened in Leeds and reommend them to all our friend.,0,5
Aldi UK,A fun shopping experience!,Aldi's always a good time. They always seem to have a little bit of everything. I always look forward to going there.,0,4
Aldi UK,Some say cheap and cheerful...,...cheerful sound s good in my ears. Good products at decent prices. Dosen't have the range of the big boys but sometimes we are spoilt for choice. Good honest products for good honest people.,0,5
Aldi UK,a good shop,"good range of food and drink,all at good prices",0,5
Aldi UK,Good quality goods at a fair price,"I always though aldi to be a seller of cheap seconds and general rubbish. I've now been shopping at aldi on and off as our nearest store is miles away and we are very happy with the quality of the produce that we have baught. they have a good range and at good prices too. Don't ever rate them as the same as a poundstore or somthing for the lower classes. They have some fantastic ranges of meats, cheeses, vegetables compairable if not better than most of the leading brands. Next time your near an Aldi pop in and have a look you never know you might suprise yourself! Please can we have one in Hemel Hempstead!",0,5
Aldi UK,good value,"When i first went to aldi a few months ago i was sceptical with the view it was all 'foreign rubbish'.how wrong i was.allthough you dont see many brand names there,after thinking...ill try this and see how i get on..i now save thirty pounds a week now on my shop and have not noticed any drop in quality,taste and quantity.sure the shelves arent the tidiest in the world and stuff is scattered about but ill take the savings over the prettiness anyday",0,4
Aldi UK,doing great got me some money,i love cheap food,0,5
Aldi UK,very cheap,Very cheap,0,1
Aldi UK,"Good value products, but sharp car park practice","I have to say that the prices and the quality of the products sold by Aldi are very good. What has spoiled it for me is the unforgiving nature of the Aldi partner company ""Parking Eye"" who charged me £40 for overstaying their Market Harborough car park by just ten minites. Aldi - despite producing proof of shopping, did not step in to assist. So this bad experience taints an otherwise good business model",0,3
Aldi UK,Simple chaep and good (generally),"Aldi I find usually has a limited selection but they offer real value for money.Some of their practices I found unusual to begin with, like no bags, which means you have to take your trolley to a shelf were and then pack your things into boxes (which there are always lost of) But their other customer experience compares with the other supermarket chains. But all in all I get what I wand and am usually pleasantly surprised with the low price I pay. Pretty good value I wish other supermarkets would focus a little less on paying a dividend to their share holders and give more value to their customers",0,4
Aldi UK,Fantastic!!,Great Quality veggies and love the special offers each week. Staff great too,0,5
Aldi UK,Great quality food at very reasonable prices,"The specials really are specials, but the every day low prices make sure that I start my weekly shopping at Aldi first, because if they have what I want the quality and price will be better than the rest",0,4
Aldi UK,Great quality at low prices,You can rely on high quality for all that they sell.Excellent value,0,5
Aldi UK,Aldo best value no fuss shopping,Love shopping at Aldi the baskets full and your purse isn't empty Excellent quality foods love he fresh meat Thanks,0,5
Aldi UK,More environment than shopper friendly stores,"Very reasonably priced food and household items. You can find sortiment you can't find in original UK stores. But boy oh boy the lay out of all their stores is so chaotic, it takes forever to find things. Also the check outs are so short so you really have to hurry and shove everything into your trolley and then go through it again to put in into the bags. Big plus is that they don't give you free bags which is very environmentaly friendly.",0,4
Aldi UK,Savings,"Another shop here to save money, over a long period of time I have tried most of their tinned and frozen items and have never come across any i do not like, even though they are foreign manufactured, their frozens are good as well, their veg always fresh, and hardware items including cloathes sometimes great value for money.",0,5
Aldi UK,"love it, poor waiting time in queues","keep up the good work. One bad thing is the queues are awful, wait forever to be served, which I have left the shop on a few occassions for",0,3
Aldi UK,great value,fab value for products. All good quality.,0,5
Aldi UK,A guilty pleasure.,"My wife hates ALDI, so they are very much a guilty pleasure. I love mooching round and finding unexpected, inexpensive surprises. Their Monday and Thursday specials are always interesting, a friend equipped his home workshop with power tools from Aldi, and I'm not far behind!",0,4
Aldi UK,I was pleasantly surprised,"I had never been to Aldi until last week when my friend asked me if I would like to go with her. I am glad I went too, I got a lot of shopping for my money, lots of special offers and everything was good quality too. I will certainly be visiting Aldi again.",0,5
Aldi UK,"I like Aldis, heaven compared with tescos.","A good but not overwhelming range of quality products at very reasonable prices, and surpringly genuine friendly staff localy, rather than some ameicanism along the lines of 'have a nice day' said in monotones of disinterest.",0,5
Aldi UK,Always use them if I can,"Always good value, only drawback is the limited range, never bought a bad product from them.",0,4
Aldi UK,Good products great prices!,"Save a fortune on shopping, food really good quality!",0,5

Aldi UK,Great offers,I like Aldi because of the offers every week.Also the staff are always friendly.,0,5
Aldi UK,Good quality at fair prices,Aldi have gone a little more upmarket in recent times and it is paying off. The quality of their produce has never troubled me and I have never had occasion to return food items. I have had problems with the Tevion brand goods I have purchased but Aldi's return policy is excellent and I have never been given any kind of trouble when returning items and being refunded. I recommend Aldi as it is a good way f saving money on one's weekly shop.,0,4
Aldi UK,Good value for money,I have shopped at aldi in germany for years and I was pleased when the started trading in england.I think they have given the large supermarkets some good competition.,0,5
Aldi UK,"Clean,roomy,and great prices.","Alright,you have to be careful what you buy when you're not used to the shop,whoever it is,if you haven't used their brands before.However,even if you just buy things recommended by papers and magazines you'll find that's quite a bit.For example their dishwasher tablets were judged the best by Which,and if your family like Snickers,try their Racers,you'll love the price,too.Fruit and veg is always fresh,and reasonably priced.",0,5
Aldi UK,Ukulele and soprano recorder,At Christmas I was amazed that they were selling Ukuleles and soprano recorders at such low prices. I couldn't believe that the Ukulele was under £20 as it has geared tuning and made of real wood. Most Ukuleles at that price are very cheap and made of laminated wood. The recorder is Yamaha and very well made with an excellent fingering chart. I am having great fun with both instruments.,0,5
Aldi UK,les duckworth,I find Aldi to be excellent not as big as the tesco etc..but quality and great prices..with a good range long may they reign,0,5
Aldi UK,"A cautionary tale. No till receipt, -NO guarantee!!!!!!!!!!!!","About 3 months ago I bought a handy looking socket set with a ratchet handle from Aldi, Ludlow. It was a 'Workzone' product, it certainly LOOKED the part, and carried a TWO YEAR GUARANTEE. I had no occasion to use it for some 6 weeks or so, but when I did, The ratchet slipped immediately, and NOT from overload or abuse. I took it all back to ALDI, LUDLOW and was essentially told to b*gg*r off because I hadn't retained the 'proof of purchase' till receipt. The manager was adamant, and the office of fair trade said that's what they do, it's their rules, and your £9-99 doesn't matter! The manager had the neck to suggest I could have bought the set from a car-boot sale, but as far as I know, these sets were not obtainable anywhere else, and were promoted ONLY in Aldi stores. So here's the warning. Aldi WILL NOT entertain any refund or stand by their so-called Guarantee UNLESS you retain original Proof of Purchase. They do not give a toss about the 'Sale of Goods Act' (Not fit for purpose) because 'you could have bought it elsewhere'. -(Not possible in this case, but hey). Net result, they've lost a regular, excellent £65 every week customer, who will NEVER again darken their doors. Have now found a LIDL not too far away,- even less expensive.",0,1
Aldi UK,love you,the future,0,5
Aldi UK,great offers,The turn over of new things available at Aldis is great,0,4
Aldi UK,great idea but you do not get discounts which places offer,,0,2
Aldi UK,Brilliant shop,Great very friendly helpful staff. Good range of products at great prices.,0,5
Aldi UK,Stock inconsistent,"The stock in Aldi is good and so are prices. Sadly, I often find I need to visit Tesco afterwards as the stock is hit and miss. The wine and jam are great value.",0,3
Aldi UK,"Many great products, and some quirky deals as well","I don't know why more people don't go to Aldi, some of their products are better (in my humble opinion) than the ""named"" brands. I use Aldi for many standard items (butter, cereals, biscuits etc) as well as cheese, yoghurt, and sliced meats. I particularly like their frozen ""three bird roast"" which makes for a great sunday lunch, and some left over for sandwiches!I can't resist browsing the non-food section, as there might be anything there - from fishing rods to televisions, spanners to knittng wool !",0,5
Aldi UK,"""BEWARE"" Not Cheap Any More ""CAUTION""",They used to be cheap and good value. Went there recently intending to fill my shopping basket with all the items they sold cheaper than Tesco's. Not any more though. Came out with only 3 items and then found cheaper equivalent at Tesco. I was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon. I think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere. Well they have gone up a lot at Aldi and far more than the others.I call this sharp practice and have no confidence to shop there any more. Sainsbury's or tesco's for me from now on.,0,1
Aldi UK,Xmas e-card,"Send this free card and when it arrived at the other end, it just turned out to be a blank red screen with Happy Xmas from Aldi on it.You can't actually contact Aldi in the UK by email...I certainly wouldn't want to pay for this service.",0,1
Aldi UK,Waitrose Eat Your Heart Out,I had no idea Aldi stocked such a great range of food products. Last week I picked up a pack of Spanish Bellota ham. Even Waitrose don't stock this premium type of ham made from pigs that have a diet of acorns.,0,5
Aldi UK,Favourite store,"I love this store. Brilliant prices, good selection of products. Good allround.",0,5
Aldi UK,Great choice of food,"Guess they are my main shop, not recognise the brands, but taste just as good and often better than those from the competitionCurrently have no vehicle and looks like might have to go back to budgens :(",0,5
Aldi UK,Great photo albums and calendars,"Superb qualitry online photo albums which allow you to add text as well as photos. Software is a wee bit primitive - but it does work and is worth perservering with. Ther bindings on the finished albums appear to be very strong, The company in Swindon which does the printing is to be congratulated for a really efficient service. Great value.",0,5
Aldi UK,Pretty damned good,"Clean, cheap and good quality. I don't care if the stuff is displayed in boxes on the shelves.It annoys me in the 'big supermarket' that there seem to be dozens of fat lazy people in company livery effectively standing around doing nothing. Presumably, somewhere along the line, I am paying for that.Aldi staff are quick, busy and helpful.I hate shopping but at least in Aldi it is as painless as it gets! THANK YOU!",0,5
Aldi UK,fantastic,well done one and all,0,5
Aldi UK,I love these guys!,"I just love Aldi shops. The food is great and excellent value too. If I was writing a review of their shop I would be giving full marks.When I stumbled across their website and thought for a moment that I could do my Christmas shop online. You can imagine my disappointment when I learned that all you can do on the website is make a shopping list to take to the shop with you. I have been successfully doing that with a pencil and paper for many years, what a total waste of time.I couldn't bring myself to give Aldi no marks, because I really like their shops, but with an average of 5 for the shops and 1 for the website I have come up with an overall score of 3. Come on Aldi, get online shopping on your website so I don't have to travel all the way to the shop!",0,3

Aldi UK,Always my first choice!,"I've been an Aldi shopper for many years now and the choice of products just gets better and better! I went on a diet in March of this year..high protein (Dukan)...lost 2.5stones...yahoo..and lived on Aldi's really well-priced fresh prawns, smoked salmon pieces, sirloin steaks, frozen sirloin joints, eggs, bacon and 'to die for' Active Fruit Layer probiotic yogurt - low fat - CHERRY! The cherry ones are the nicest because they don't taste too sweet ..but everyone seems to want them so it's a struggle to get into store early enough before they are snapped up! I've kept mentioning at check-out that they don't ever have enough of them, and horror of horrors right now they seem to have disappeared altogether! Raspberry isn't bad but a lot sweeter, so nothing like as yummy as the cherry! If you are reading this Aldi, please please can we have Cherry back! On occasions I've had to almost fight for them at the shelves and frequently have travelled from Coalville to A5 and then Atherstone stores to be able to collect enough of them to last me the week...which is a bit tedious! I'm still keeping the faith though...Aldi just can't be beaten for quality!",0,5

Aldi UK,"Great food, Great prices!","Aldi has my vote all the time!...my weekly shopping in aldi can cost anything between £70 - £100 per week for 6 of us, but i know if i go to any of the other big supermarkets it is more than doubled and that is buying the bigger supermarkets low cost value brands...also i love the special offer aldi do with fruit & veg every week, only disappointment i have is that they dont do much vegetarian food, would love to see veggie burgers, nut roast etc...then i wouldnt have to go to another supermarket at all",0,5
Aldi UK,Excellent,Love doing business with them,0,5
Aldi UK,"Good, but is ran into 2nd by Lidl's","Again, like Lidl's, it's products are very tasty & a very good price....but, due to advertising campaign's, I have noticed many price increases throughout the store.

The company...pay too good money...to unpolite,unhappy staff!",0,5
Aldi UK,Good food at a fair price,"I've been shopping at Aldi ever since they opened in my home town.I've continued to sing their praises over many years, despite many of my friends viewing Aldi with disdain - considering their offerings to be cheap and low quality. I have to confess that in the early days of Aldi's presence most of the people I encountered on my shopping trips appeared to be none too wealthy - rather than the savvy shoppers much in evidence today.Aldi's chocolate digestives are the only one's I will eat now - and I used to be passionate about McVities. Their breakfast cereals are all top notch and more than a match for the brand leaders, and their fruit and veg is as good as any other supermarkets - but at a much lower cost.If you've never used Aldi give them a try. You'll never go back to Tesco!",0,5
Aldi UK,"Great service, great deals, definetly recommend!","When shopping, I often use aldi as my benchmark - i rarely use tesco now that I have a local aldi store. Brilliant!",0,5
Aldi UK,Love this chain,"I love the size of the shops, the items they stock, the twice weekly specials. And the price is pretty good too",0,5
Aldi UK,Great Quality & Value,"on using Aldi we were amazed at the quality and pricing of the food, meats and veg. always at a cheaper price than the bigger supermarkets, The fruit & veg in particular is of a very high standard and stays fresh for days, unlike the larger supermarkets where it deteriorates within hours.We now do the majority of our shopping at Aldi",0,5
Aldi UK,Won't let me give no stars!,"Ok, perhaps I am a snob, so don't like the idea of Aldi...However, my darling wife has talked me into trying it out...Appalling, terrible layout, terrible choice, well I suppose it's difficult when your buying others cast offs...Ended up buying £50.00 worth off meat.Just finished a meal using their best free range chicken breast.The only thing that I can say that is positive is that I have been able to say to my wife is.... I told you so!Utter rubbish, un-chewable... I wouldn't feed it to our dog.Good luck to those poor people that actually think that saving £0.20 to £0.50 is worth it....",0,1
Aldi UK,Acceptable,I cant buy much stuff in there cos of the quality aND when u get to the tills is a bit scary cos they trow your goodies like savage...,0,2
Aldi UK,Cheap and cheerful.,"If you have a big store then Aldi is great, however the smaller stores are not stocked well enough for you to do a full weeks shopping. They do have some great deals and offers and one of special items. If you don't mind being whizzed through the checkout like a sheep in a sheep dip then it's a great store to go to. Check the website for deals of the week and special offers.",0,4
Aldi UK,GOOD PRICES,"SHOP AT ALDI AND YOU SAVE MONEY ,",0,5
Aldi UK,So Good its not true,"No special offers, no loyalty points, no tokens> They don't need it everything is already at the right price, tryit! A weekly shop in Aldi is about a third of the cost in the major supermarkets.I then go to Marks for my ""bits"" . Best of both worlds",0,5
Aldi UK,Disappointing website.,"Aldi may be very downmarket, but they are also very cheap. I dont think they do home delivery. So unless you have an Aldi locally you will miss out on their bargains. Compared with other supermarket chains I would describe Aldis website as boring and laclustre. So if you want bargains go to an Aldi store because the website is a waste of time.",0,3
Aldi UK,Be careful what you buy!,Some food is of excellent quality but also some is second rate! The staff in the stores are trained to get the food down the conveyor belt as quickly as possible which can lead to panick on the check out!!,0,3
Aldi UK,Shopping at Aldi - a good experience,"We shopped at Tesco for years, stacking up the points and spending lots. Then we found Aldi up the road and tried it, their special offer fruit and veg was the incentive, they we started picking up all our veg there and now we rarely visit Tesco. The selection of goods at Aldi is not as broad as the larger supermarkets, but the quality is good, prices unbeatable and the staff can really get things through the checkout at amazing speed.Give it a try.",0,4
