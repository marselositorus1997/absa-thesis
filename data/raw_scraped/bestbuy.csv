Best Buy,DONT BUY FROM Best Buy,"DONT BUY FROM Best Buy. I bought a 1400 dollar PC in November of 2020. It's a very good PC and broke down in about 4 months. I called the manufacturer and apparently it had a defective mother board from the get go. I figured It would be a no brainer for us to send it back and replace but how wrong I was. I called them various times and was hung up on, put on hold to many times, and was on call for about 2 hours. They refused to give us anything and said that we had to call the manufacturer to get it fixed which would cost about 400 dollars for shipping and would take around 2 months maybe if they actually get it fixed. Basically they don't stand behind the products they sell.",0,1
Best Buy,Beyond bad delivery service,"I have consistently had good service from sales associates and store managers and technicians who have installed appliances. However, I recently ordered eight kitchen and laundry appliances. Six of those were to have been delivered two weeks ago. I received a text message reminding me of my order and it’s pending arrival. On the day of delivery I became suspicious not having received a phone call informing me of my delivery window. I tried to contact the store, but the store was not accepting phone calls. Needing a refrigerator desperately I went on line and made a request for a call back. I received a phone call very quickly and was informed my delivery had been cancelled and would be rescheduled. The operator who contacted me said she could see the store had the refrigerator ready and advised I drive to the store and speak with the store manager. I followed her advice and the store manager arranged for a next day delivery, which took place. Remaining now were the remaining five appliances plus two others that were on a separate order. The two other appliances were scheduled for today, and though late, they did arrive. The remaining appliances were spread across thee dates. One of those was also for today. I had received a phone call the day before reminding me of my scheduled delivery window. Installation, would be a separate appointment date, the following day. It is now 9 pm and the appliances have not arrived nor have I heard from Best Buy. I did received a phone call late this afternoon giving me an installation window of 10 to 1:00 tomorrow for appliances that have not arrived. I have no idea if and when the appliances and installers will arrive tomorrow. I have two other appliances that were rescheduled for one week from now. At no time when my items did not show up was I contacted by Best Buy. Instead I had to call Best Buy - call a store that does not take phone calls which means going on line and hoping for the best. In addition, I have had to go without basic things like a stove/oven and because my old appliances were removed to make room for the new ones scheduled to arrive two weeks ago, the water lines in my kitchen sink were disconnect when the dish washer was removed, so I’ve had no use of my kitchen sink . Three weeks without use of a kitchen sink. Finally, I have lost three days of my time waiting for appliances to be delivered and will lose at least two more days. Five days lost for what was scheduled in two deliveries. This is to say the least, totally unacceptable. NEVER AGAIN!Addendum: May 6, next day. Called Best Buy help line to confirm delivery and installation for later in the morning. Was told both would need to be rescheduled. Note again they did not call me, I called them. I was now given the following week delivery on Monday and installation on Wednesday for these three appliances.Addendum: instead of the installation taking place 5/12 as told on the phone an email just received gives the installation date as 5/26. Another phone call to Best Buy.",0,1
Best Buy,Worst buy,Worst buy. Don't do it. Go to Amazon instead. Same prices. Less bull crap.Their website will send you package to won't addresses. They're service is out sourced to India They don't care. They'll just take your hard earned money.,0,1
Best Buy,I don't even know where to begin at how…,"I don't even know where to begin at how wrong things have gone with my attempt to buy a refrigerator from Best Buy. It has been delayed in delivery for over a week. Every time I call to attempt to find out its status and how to reschedule or cancel, they tell me there is an error and that the warehouse must update the status first, which could take 24 hours, and then changes can be made. So I can't even cancel this refrigerator that I don't have to get a refund until this happens. It's been over 160 hours, and no updates from the warehouse, who miraculously cannot be reached. This is the risk you take purchasing from these big box stores - their supply chains are so massive and strained that their own departments can't even cross-communicate. It's insane. I can't wait to resolve this issue and N E V E R shop at a best buy again.",0,1

Two weeks ago but the LG washer and dryer it delivered after 15 days they didn’t even install the dryer Because they didn’t have a right flexible vent pipe. I was trying to use the washer and dryer for the first time the door for the washer won’t close. I called the customer service Add scheduled for another week to replace it.

Best Buy,I ordered a washer/dryer from them,I ordered a washer/dryer from them. They decided to ship without the pedestals and were doing install. I went to move the date one day to match the date of the full delivery. They moved me out a week on their system. I called 5 minutes later and said my time was gone. I wait a week then the show up. The guy does not tell anyone but cant find the water shut off. I show him where it is but then he and his supervisor said they took to long and have to go to someone else. THIS COMPANY IS GARBAGE and their people do not care for their customers. The supervisors should be picking up garbage on the side of a highway but I fear they could not do that properly. Never again.,0,1
Best Buy,Shady Company,"I went to the Best Buy store in Issaquah, WA today. There were more security checkers than people who actually understand tech and after today I don't think they do anymore! . All I wanted was a battery charger because my charger wasn't working. The guy at the door steered me to where all the new laptops that were being sold. The guy was dealing with another customer. When.he asked me what I was looking for, I told him a new battery because mine wasn't working. He had a customer and they put me on a list to get assistance. Good Luck! What, I found weird was the customer in front of me. She had heard the whole conversation with the tech guy. All of a sudden she said she had the same thing happen to her laptop. And then told me it was a hard drive problem and I should go to the ""geek squad"". Or, get a new laptop. I literally RAN out of the store as I felt I was getting set up. I went next door to Fred Meyer and was able to buy what I needed. And, it worked. I will never go back again,",0,1
Best Buy,Don't take your Apple care repairs to best buy,Don't take your repairs to best buy! You can't call the store to get updates! I've been told twice already a time when my phone would be ready for pickup by an employee at the store and it wasn't ready! All you can call is corporate and they just show the status employees have marked which is that it wasn't ready... The phone is my business phone... so if your lively hood depends on it then plan to lose all your business for about a week while they drag out the service in hopes you'll just buy another phone. Oh and a tech won't even see you unless you have an appointment which you have to make in person and can't do over the phone!,0,1
Best Buy,Terrible treatment of Customers,"No interest in customer Service. Shop elsewhere. Search out the ""mom & pop"" stores where the owner is local. You pay a little more but they want your business. I needed a fan for my computer. I called the local Best Buy. Recording said that they are not answering the phones and you must call their corp 800#. I tried that. Well, long wait times and the usual ""press this for that..."". Finally a person answered but said her department could not help and I must call the ""Geek Squad"". After two wrong transfers on their part, I got a ""Geek"" woman who could not answer my question about a simple computer cooling fan and whether they stocked them. I tried to explain good customer service and how difficult it is to deal with them. All she could say was the corporate line, ""I understand your frustration"". Finally she said that I must order it. I asked if they had what I need. She said that I must talk to the sales department. Two more wrong transfers. Finally, after another long wait time, a sales guy answered. I tried to tell him how hard it is to deal with his company. He just hung up on me in mid sentence. We have some big ticket items to buy this summer. I'll tell you where we will not be shopping.....BEST BUY! I'd rather pay a little more and support the smaller local shops. Buy Buy Best Buy!!!",0,1
Best Buy,What a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!,"What a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!. Navigating the auto attendant when trying to call and speak to human being is infuriating. Navigating the web site is a joke. After spending much valuable time I gave up. No one answers the phone, the online chat doesn’t work and the web site doesn't provide details. I'm trying to spend $850 on a washing machine and all I need to know is if you have it in stock and when I can pick it up.

Best Buy,You guys are the worst at customer care,"You guys are the worst at customer care. I had an issue using my reward certificate on a purchase. I spoke to two phone agents, they kept me waiting for 10 mins and acted like they were helping, but simply hang up the phone. How does it even a good customer care service? don't you guys realize I will be speaking to new agents every time I make calls? You guys really want me to explain the issue to every agent I speak to, only to see they hang up on me without notice. This happened on 04/29/2021 around 6.45 PM EST.Maybe this can help you guys track those irresponsible phone agents, who are getting paid for nothing and providing the worst customer care.",0,1
Best Buy,Fitbit shopping time!,"Fitbit shopping time!Checking online showed that this BestBuy had my choice Fitbit device on sale for $30 off! I thought “Let’s give the local store the business” even though they were $20 more than Amazon. So, off we went to the Wyomissing store.Sure enough… One left on the shelf. Yay! No shelf price tags on anything, so I went to the online store on my phone and grabbed a screenshot of the Fitbit with the SKU and sale price. Smart!Had to wait a very long time time in line - only one cashier - grrr.My turn. Associate rings it up… HANG ON! Wrong price!Cashier pulls out his cellphone and looks it up. “Nope” he shows me his screen… full list price!!I check on my phone… and.. say what?… the price went up while I was standing in line!!! Aha! Pull up my screenshot (with clock showing it was 15 minutes ago)! Whew!“No go” he says, “prices change”. “Ok” talk to the manager, please”. I step out of line and wait.Very young manager shows up. I explain it all… whole story… show my pic… and…“Nothing we can do. Prices change.” Short and sweet!“So let me get this straight”, I said. “You’re going to let a regular customer who buys appliances and big screen TVs here, be unhappy and walk out of this store… to never return again… for a measly $30?”“Do whatever you want to do, man!” He smiles.—-Sitting in the Best Buy parking lot 2 minutes later I ordered the Fitbit I wanted from Amazon… $50 cheaper than list price!—-Today I deleted the Best Buy app from my phone.",0,1
Best Buy,"Thanks for wasting my time, Best Buy.","Had a problem with my computer and called Best Buy/Geek Squad. They set up an appt to bring it into a store and said they would do a diagnostic for NO CHARGE (I specifically confirmed twice) but they would charge for software or hardware repair. I took time off of work and lugged my tower down there and the guy at the store tells me they charge $100 for the diagnostic. It's an older computer and if there's something obsolete I'll have to replace it anyway. Thanks for wasting my time, Best Buy.",0,1
Best Buy,"If I could give them a zero, I would.","If I could give them a zero, I would. I have spent the last three weeks attempting to get a working washer and dryer. The one they sent was defective and didn't work. They sent a repair person who was useless and didn't repair the washer (he turned it on and said, see it is working but didn't pay attention that the washer didn't go through the wash cycle). After many hours of phone calls, they agreed to exchange the unit with another one. They came yesterday, had one issue and left after 10 minutes when I was attempting to resolve it with them. After many more hours today I can't even get a human on the phone to help me. I was just on hold for 30 minutes and then automatically disconnected.",0,1
Best Buy,If I could give the 0 stars I would,"If I could give the 0 stars I would. We purchase all new appliances through them this year. The people in the store were awesome. One day suddenly one of the appliances was cancelled before delivery, no reason. So I contacted them and eventually it was sorted out. Before the appliances were delivered I decided to switch the color, and asked to ensure the 5 year warranty was on the new one. I was assured it was and I would see the warranty online after it was delivered. Well it was delivered, no warranty showing. I called and they said no warranty was ever added to the new one, but now that it was delivered I had to go to a store and sort it out, as they could no longer add it. Horrible experience. Also, the refrigerator was delivered with a dent in the door. The gentleman who delivered it called and reported the damage, and I promptly received a call from geek squad to either have it replaced or get a gift card. I chose to have it replaced and the gal said to keep using it and they will be in touch. I few days went by and I heard nothing. I reached out to customer care and there was no record of the case. I was obviously upset and so ready to be done with it, so I said fine just send the gift card. I was given a case ID #. A month went buy, I didn't hear anything or receive anything in the mail. I finally called and once again they had no record of the original replacement request or the settling on a gift card instead. The case ID I was given was not valid. The gal on the phone said they could offer me a $100 gift card (when the previous gal approved much higher). I said no way, that is not was I was originally offered. Ultimately she said it is what it is, so I said fine, I'll take the replacement like originally requested on the delivery day. She then said it is outside the return window now. What?!? No, I requested the replacement a month ago and never heard back. Eventually she put in the replacement order, I received the email confirmation. The next morning I received a order cancelled email. Noooo!!! I reached out through chat and they cannot put the order in again. I've been given another number, again. I've spent hours and hours on the phone, on chat, and visiting the store to sort this out. Geed squad has been the worst out of everyone. That team needs a major overhaul. Here I am, problem still not solved. I'm never giving Best Buy any of my money again.",0,1

Best Buy,DONT BUY FROM BESTBUY!!!!!,"So we ordered a 27 cubic foot Samsung Refrigerator from Best Buy. On the website you have the option to have it installed in your home for a cost of around $150.00 or you can chose to have the item placed in the room of your choice for free. We chose to have the item brought in the front door and left so I would do the install myself. Upon delivery, the drivers told us they wouldnt bring it in the house unless we paid them the 150.00 to which we let them know the website stated otherwise. In a nutshell, they left the item in my open air carport and it was stolen. There was no possibility that I would have been able to bring that into the house alone as it took 2 of them with a dolly to take it off of their truck. After 20+ calls and numerous emails to Best Buy and the BBB, we are out of a Refrigerator and 1300.00. Great Job Best Buy. Way to screw over your customers. Oh by the way, don't call your bank because when they dropped it off in my carport, I automatically took posession of the item. Hmmmmmmmm How did that happen when i didnt sign a reciept? Hmmmmm",0,1

Best Buy chat tells me that there was a hold on my credit card (lie) and that the delivery is set when the payment is processed. Zero notification of any problem or delay. They obviously did not have the item in stock as promised. I absolutely hate the idea of giving Amazon all my business, and the only other laptop retailer around anymore is Best Buy.

Best Buy,"Just take your business to Amazon or Newegg, not great to work for","I usually buy my electronics from them, they do price match with Amazon. I worked for them for a few months last year. Their management is terrible and they don't give you their hours that they promise. I worked for them for 4 months on seasonal, they only scheduled me twice, when they hired me, they promised I would be working 12 hours a week MINIMUM, didn't even schedule me on Black Friday. Now, I understand the pandemic was going on, and still is, but if you make a promise to someone, you need to have integrity and keep that promise. Believe me, I wasn't unqualified either, I knew more about computers than the management did(I'm a licensed professional in the state of Utah), and those 2 days I worked there, I made more sales than anyone else in the whole store. Apparently $10,000 worth of computer sales in 2 days isn't good enough to schedule me again...Also, on top of that. Geek squad lies to their customers, they will upsell you on everything. Before I was working there I saw a guy about age 50 he brought in a broken PC said it wouldn't turn on and I saw the Geek Squad employee outright lie to that man's face, they told him his computer was broken and there was no possible way they could fix it. I walked over to the guy and looked at it, and within 5 minutes figured out his PSU was shot, and he just needed a new one. The employee gave me a look of disgust and hate. They were trying to make a sale and tell a guy his computer was broken and prey on his very limited knowledge of computers, that's not right, that's a terrible business practice! That employee should be FIRED for lying to a customer's face.",0,2

No one called the day before or the day of. I went to the store two times and talked to mangers about the problem. The second time I went it was after 1:30 with a no show for the installation. The general manger guaranteed me someone would contact me if not he would call me before the store close. Well that didn’t happen.

Best Buy,Bait and Switch,"My wife and I recently got a radio installed in our car at the Green Bay store. The installation itself is fine. The radio works, and that part is all well and good, thus, I give it higher than one star. We ordered our things for the installation based on their computer choosing everything for our exact year and model of car. When we got there, we were told, “Your $14 harness won’t work. You’ll need this $140 one.” Wait a minute. Didn’t YOUR computer take our exact year, model, and make of our car? Didn’t YOUR computer say it was right? It shouldn’t be wrong, and definitely not 10 times the cost wrong! When we got home, my son said they had done the same thing to one of his friends that went there. “Wrong part. You’ll need this way more expensive one.” Weeks after, one of my sons was getting his radio installed. “Oh, we ordered the wrong speakers. You need these more expensive ones.” Two days later, my other son got his radio installed. Sure enough, they had ordered the “wrong radio” and wanted him to install one that was $300 more. Turns out, he didn’t have the wrong radio. They specifically told him they were just trying to get him some cool features (that his car already did without the extra money.) I am disgusted and disappointed that this happened. Again, yes, the radio works well. But, knowing that they’ve done it to four out of four people we know that have gone there to get a radio installed tells me it’s not a coincidence. This is what they do, and it’s wrong.",0,2

Canceled my order and got my money back. Would never deal with Best Buy again.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy Warranty Scam & Awful Customer Service,"Best Buy computer warranty and services are a scam. Do NOT purchase your computer hardware from Best Buy. Awful customer service. Will NEVER make another purchase from Best Buy again. Buyer Beware!! The Best Buy computer repair warranty is a total scam. I purchased a New Republic of Gamers PC that was an immediate problem. It would not turn on. If it did turn on it would randomly turn off and crash. Then it would take days for it to turn on again. Best Buy REFUSED to allow me to return it and insisted it had to be sent away to be assessed and fixed before it could be returned for a computer that worked. It took 2 MONTHS for Best Buy to ship the computer to the service center, have the computer serviced, and then shipped back. They replaced the mother board. It still did not work. We requested that it be replaced with another computer and they said that it was now too late to do so. It took 2 months for the computer to be serviced and Best Buy has been in possession of my computer longer than I have. Since the service took so long the time frame for being able to return the computer was exceeded. They now have the computer again and expect it will be another 2 months (at least) to have the computer assessed and fixed again. (If it can be fixed) As per the Best Buy policy I will have to go through this process 3 times before their lemon law process will apply. However, because of the time it will take for service that will more than likely exceed the turn around time requirement for the lemon law to apply. In the mean time they did offer to sell me another new computer since I will not have one and need one for work. (I declined and purchased a computer elsewhere.) THIS IS A SCAM. They sold me a lemon and refuse to replace it and make sure the service time frames exceed the ability for you to return the computer -- but they don't mind profiting trying to get you to purchase another computer! If that was not bad enough, the manager of the Cypresswood Geek Squad was extremely rude, condescending, argumentative, and tried to blame me for the computer not working- even though the Geek Squad and the best Buy service center had the exact same problem and another Geek Squad employee supported my story. If I had chosen to go to another vendor like Wal-Mart I could have just had the computer returned and replaced. I have a brand new computer I can't use and had to purchase another computer so that I can actually work. I continue to pay for the first computer though it has never consistently worked and it has not been in my possession most of the time I have owned it. Best Buy and the Geek Squad has terrible customer service. The Best Buy warranty policies are established to create bureaucracy, frustration, and scam you out of your purchase. Also, at the Cypresswood location, if you call the store in an attempt to speak with a manager the VM states the store no longer accepts phone calls. After this experience it is no wonder why Best Buy is struggling as a company and about to declare bankruptcy. I certainly would not want anyone to ever go through this hellish nightmare. Take your business to a company that respects their customers and honors their commitments.",0,1

Best Buy,I had a $2000.00 LG washer and dryer…,"I had a $2000.00 LG washer and dryer almost delivered this morning. I explained to him right off the bat that I was in severe pain and hadn't worked since August 2019. I could barely walk my back and my neck are bad, I little strength in my legs, my right hand is hard to use as it was severely fractured. Many planned surgeries were put on hold because of Covid, When we got downstairs I pointed out two pedestals for the appliances and asked if they could put them in the laundry room, he rudely said no, that was ok He went outside. I was downstairs trying to move the pedestal for the washer into the laundry room, he came downstairs and said customer service want to talk to me, I said it would have to wait until I finished moving the pedestal another eight feet or so. II struggle to get up the stairs and got to the back step and they were putting appliance back min truck, I asked them what they were doing and said I would have to make another appointment. I asked why he said to call customer service. I called customer service, He said they were not comfortable. I told them I examined by heath issues when they came and told customer service I haven't been cheerful for a year and a half. I now realize em apathy and compassion are not traits of their employees, II also realize they probably hire the lowest bid for contract delivery. Best Buy should monitor the service they are giving. At least three times during my conversation he said I was not pleasant to the delivery people. he totally did not care about my concerns. I told him I told the delivery people several times about my health issues. They showed no care or concerns for the customer or good service. It was such a pleasure buying them, the sales lady who went above and beyond helping me was caring and understanding and the delivery guy turned me against Best Buy. If this guy worked for me I would fire him",0,1

Best Buy,Wrong answers…,"Ordered a phone online to be picked up at store. Traveled to the store a day later and told it was shipped. No email notification. Checked account and see that someone needs to sign for phone. Go back home at 11:15am. Called 888-237-8289 11times over an 8hr period. Spoke to 14 people. Every single person I spoke to gave me incorrect info. ""No tracking number because they driver gets it when he receives the item"". I said if there's no tracking number at 5pm I'm not getting the phone. Moron tells me the phone will arrive by 9pm. I wanted to speak to a supervisor, waited 20mins and got ""I'm with Home Entertainment and can't help you"". ""Yes the store closes at 7pm,but deliveries go until 9pm"". ""You dropped your phone off for repair and want to know when it'll be delivered?"" Found out phone wasn't going to be delivered because of a problem with activation. After the idiot I spoke to ""activated"" the new phone (??) my LG phone acted up. I asked if I could just pick up the phone. ""We can't change the order"". Asked them to call the store about tracking number. ""We can't do that it's illegal"". Called at 7:30pm and I'm told phone would not be delivered because store closes at 7.

Best Buy,FALSE ADVERTISING!!,"Bought (through their website) the Samsung Galaxy S10+, unlocked and ""unboxed"", meaning that the box was not sealed. It was NOT a refurbished phone. It arrived yesterday, in a plain cardboard box. Opened it to find that there was no Samsung box inside, but 3 strips of bubble wrap with a phone, a cord and the charger. There were no earphones, SIM card tool or screen protector as mentioned in the specifications. NOT EVEN A BOOKLET. Nor did they ever mention that those (missing) items WILL NOT be included. Spent about 40 minutes texting with their Live Chat who eventually informs me that they can't do anything from their end and that I have to personally go to the store, close by (fortunately).At the store, customer service informs me that they don't have the missing items, and that sometimes those items may or may not be included with ""unboxed"" phones. If THAT'S the case, they should CLEARLY mention it. Screams of FALSE ADVERTISING! Also, I will be charged $45 as a ""restocking fee"", if I return within 14 days.I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with THIS experience from Best Buy, a nationwide store. More so, since 2 weeks ago I bought a NEW (boxed) Samsung Galaxy S10 for my wife from their national sales agent over the phone (after scrutinizing the phone on the Best Buy website AND through Samsung Live Chat to verify that the S10 advertised was authentic) without any problems.UPDATE: I went to Best Buy today to return the phone. The sales lady asked me why I was returning it. Naturally I mentioned the missing items that are listed in the specs, and not being informed about it. She looked up the phone online and saw all the pieces advertised. She said she would try to waive the ""restocking fee"", called the manager. He showed up, punched some codes and canceled the fee! Many apologies given by the the sales lady. Needless to say, I was ecstatic to get the entire amount refunded. Maybe the nice jacket I wore made a difference.",0,1

Customer service is a JOKE - they didn't have half the calls I made recorded in the log so I had to go through the same story over and over. Cherry on top - 2nd set of delivery guys broke the handle off my front door - o apology, no reimbusement - just handed it to me like trash from the floor. Oh also, their delivery people DO NOT follow mask or social distancing rules. Kept asking me to come into a small laundry room with them to explain something WITH THEIR MASKS PULLED DOWN. Disgusting. FYI, still holding on to my merchandise because they can't figure out how to deliver a dryer because it's an inch too deep. Keep in mind, they've already delivered the washer WHICH IS THE SAME SIZE.

Best Buy,Not honoring a sale price,We attempted to purchase a product that was on sale online but due to technical difficulties the sale did not go through.

Best Buy,next day shipping is a lie,"I needed a new percussion massage gun for a sports-related injury quickly and decided to give Best Buy a shot since they were offering free next-day shipping for said item. Upon waking up the following day, I was informed by email that my delivery was delayed and should ship 'in the next few days.' Unsatisfied with this vague and uncertain timeline, I contacted chat support to cancel the item. As soon as I requested cancellation, I was informed that in spite of the 'automated' email saying it would be delayed, the item should still arrive that day. When it did not arrive, I contacted support once more and asked about the status, only to be informed that the item was, in fact, delayed and the estimated delivery date was 2 weeks away. Of course I again tried to cancel, and I was informed by several support people and eventually a manager that my request 'simply was not possible,' as if the technology to cancel a one-item order was still years away and humanity simply isn't there yet. He could not tell me where the item was, or when it should arrive, or really anything about it, other than the fact that it could not possibly be canceled and would have to be returned via mail or in store if/when it ever should happen to arrive.The entire experience made me wonder whether Best Buy's new strategy is to capture orders by over-promising fast shipping that they cannot possibly deliver on, and then making it next to impossible to cancel those orders once the true delivery date is ultimately revealed to the hapless, disappointed customer. I can't be certain of that, but I am certain that I'll return the item if it ever gets here so that they do not profit off of this misrepresentation, and never shop there again. Canceling the order would have been much, much more profitable for them in the long run.",0,1

I canceled the order, which at this point was noted as awaiting my input for scheduling, and received a refund. I will never do business with that store again. The store insulates itself from customers by not allowing incoming phone calls due to Covid (We all know how it spreads via phone calls!??) so all calls are routed to a national operator.

(when I got home the computer was locked) I came back to the store and they told me that I needed to ignored that and press enter. (How I am supposed to know that) I Had to drive back wasted time and more important expose myself one more time to Covid 19. Unnecessary risk for a cancer survivor with a compromised immune system. They told me that the person that gave me the computer was supposed to explained this to me. Unfortunately, Alex did not. Then the store manager Charity and Geek Squad manager Nick got together and gave me a discount of $32.11 cents. (According to them there are no more discounts on repairs even though they screw up the process) Waited another 50 minutes for this discount. (No one cares) Both managers were very policy driven than customer service driven. (exchange with them no more than 5 words) The only Geek Squad team member that showed compassion and it seems truly sorry for the situation is Josh. (He should be the manager) He was very professional to the point, knowledgeable of his job. Based on my 50 minutes experience with Josh I noticed that he was for sure trained by a bigger/giant company in the tech world (which they include customer service as part of their training) and sure enough it showed - He use to work for APPLE.

Best Buy,This was the absolute worst service I…,"This was the absolute worst service I have ever received. I paid a yearly fee for geek squad services. I purchased a pad from Best Buy Tulsa 41st street. I simply needed the pad set up. The customer service person sent me to the Geek Squad line for help. After standing in line for sometime I learned it would be over 2 hours to get any help not to mention the girl behind the counter wanted to argue that the geek squad was technically in back so they were there to offer service just not till 2 hours. I promptly demanded my money back for the pad. I am desperately trying to reach corporate by phone to get a REFUND on the yearly fee that was already paid . In short I will never use Best Buy again, and will now use Amazon",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy Servíce Plan is a waste,"I was convinced that it made sense to become an annual service contract subscriber at Best Buy. It does not. It is impossible to get them to answer the phone to schedule an appointment to deal with problems with my TV and home theater. I am disabled. When I go in there to secure an appointment there was a line of 10 or 12 people waiting to speak with a single service person. I cannot stand comfortably for half an hour or whatever would take. Suggest you save a couple hundred bucks and don’t enroll in their service plan. And if service is important, purchase from someone other than Best Buy.",0,1
Best Buy,"On March 17th I purchased a ""Display…","On March 17th I purchased a ""Display Port to Display Port"" cable. It turns out that it was not what the Customer Service Rep said I needed. I took it back on 6 April which was 6 days past the 15 allowed. I wanted to exchange it for the correct cable. I was in line 15 minutes with 4 other people and one rep at the exchange counter. When I asked for the refund they said I could go get it and get back in line. I asked to just get the cash and then I could pay at the register and avoid the line. The rep said no, policy was that I get a store credit and not the cash. I asked for a manager. A young man in his 20's claimed to be the manager and asked if he could help. I explained I did not want store credit because it they did not have the cable I would go elsewhere. He said all he could do was the store credit and I said I did not want it. I asked for the corporate number which he, as a manager, said he did not have. When I asked he said he could not do anything for me. I told him to just give me the store credit and I would call corporate. He then stated I would not get a credit since I had already refused it. I was livid. He said I would have to leave and I stated I would as soon as he gave me the credit or cash as I would not be coming back. He told me to leave the counter because they had a lot of returns to take care of, and I pointed out that was the problem before - standing in a line again. I told him I would not move until the issue was resolved. He said he was going to talk to his security and I told him call the police so that a proper report could be filed. I was in the line and at the counter for forty minutes now. He went over to talk to an older individual who was obviously in charge an after ten minutes then came back and said he would ""give me the credit just to get me out of the store"". I tried to call the corporate headquarters but the complaint number is a Central American call center that said there was nothing they could do - only report it up. I tried calling today and got an Asian call center who said the same. It is impossible to talk to anyone about a $32 cable which makes me furious that I purchased an iPad, TV, and Xbox there in the last few weeks. Not only does Best Buy not properly train their employees in customer service, but they allow employees to claim they are managers when they are not. They do not employ American call centers and have the absolute worst corporate relationship with their customers, as they do everything to avoid them. I did go to COSTCO to get the correct cable, and their return policy is 90 days.",0,1

All I want was clarity why my Best Buy card keeps getting order's canceled when my billing and shipping address are correct and the same address when I've already verified with Citi that it's the correct address and that my payment did get processed. I just want clarity why my order is being canceled and what I need to verify just so I can just move on with my day. I don't need someone to constantly question me about something I've already verified, I just need someone who can point me in the right direction or at least some semblance of it. Like what is the most common areas to look to verify? Is 2FA required for verification? Should I look over my billing address for the correct formatting? Just anything! I really don't understand how hard that is! It's like me asking ""oh, are LED TVs better or are LCD TVs better?"" A generic ""I think LED is better"" is better customer service than what I was even given.

Many, many calls and chats to get it delivered-making me wait another couple of days. Found a washing machine that I could get the next day somewhere else and called to cancel my order. They refused to cancel it, stating it is in transit and their system does not allow it. No one will return your call. NO one will let you talk to a supervisor. Now I am stuck with no clean clothes and no laundromat in my area until they decide to get around to delivering it. Worst part is, I do not trust that they will deliver it when they now say they will. What am I to do with no clean clothes? They don't care at all. They will never get my money ever again. I can not believe that after they did not live up to what I paid them for, I have to suffer and they still get their money. Unheard of. They messed up, they should let me cancel and get my money back. I feel like a slave to best buy. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!",0,1
Best Buy,Nothing but problems with delivery,"We have had nothing but problems with best buy and having products delivered. We purchased a washer and dryer set a couple of years ago and the delivery time was to be between noon and 6 p.m. we get a call about 30 minutes before 6 saying the delivery truck has a flat on the side of the road and they were running behind. They did not show up until almost 9 p.m. when they unloaded them to hook them up there was a huge dent on them. We had them take it back so they did and ordered new to be delivered again. And again between 12 and 6 delivery time. We get a call again saying they had yet another flat tired and will be late. They got to our house by 7:30. They unloaded the items and no dents. They hooked it up and started it then left while it was on test. The washer made loud noises so we called them again. Spending almost 1900 on product it should work right to start with but they offered to repair it. We said no we are done with this brand obviously they can not work. So they said to come in and pick out another brand we did. This time they called and said another flat but items worked good. We just got an lg fridge for $2900. They show up early this time and unload it. There is not one side of this new fridge/freezer that was not destroyed. We were already asked to get our fridge unhooked so they can take it out before new one can come in so we did. They came in and said you might want to look at this. My husband went out and looked at it, got pictures of the dents on all sides. They say what do you want us to do with it? We said take it back we are not taking a trashed up 2900 fridge/freezer. They load it saying they will call their boss and let them know. My husband calls best buy and they say there is nothing we can do. The drivery drivers do not have it back yet. There is no notes saying what there is something wrong with it. It just says not delivered. They can not even order a new one for us. We had to wait 2 weeks for it to be delivered and paid enough money and have no product. We suggest to anyone not to get delivered product from best buy and have it delivered. If possible just not order any large items from best buy. This will be the last time we deal with best buy and will definitely tell of our frustration to family and friends.Update, they got it back after a couple of days. When we called to have them order a new one they asked we thought we just had to set up a delivery time for this one. My husband explained no it was severely damaged. She looked and said oh i see those notes now. She went to set up an new order and asked to have time frame to deliver my husband said any time on weekend, i am home. She tried to schedule a week day. He said no again weekend. Now we have to wait until the 17th to get new fridge/freezer. That is over a month wait. They have had our money for this month because we paid at first time we ordered. Thats enough time to get money from interest from bank on our money. Still not delivered i will update when it gets here.",0,1

Best Buy,They ruined their college’s sales contract.,"new card. So I've just ordered and they will deliver after several weeks. Bruno helped all these for me. The next day, I got there again to see if I can exchange the refrigerator with the other model , just one out of 6 items. Jonathan was there and Bruno was off that day. Jonathan said it's is possible and did something for this. And then, he said that I can change the fridge but to do so, I have to cancel the previous order and reorder everything. I said OK and thought it would be the quick and simple way for saving our time and systemic efficiency. Definitely I said I made a new credit card 2 days ago and he also saw my card account paper and checked thru his file which was saying that this was the first order of a new card member. This means that he was definitely or should be aware of 10% reward that was my first priority because he is a sales person who is selling this 10% promotion everyday.And Jonathan's attitude was pretty bad keep saying that Bruno ,, bla bla I don't know bla bla. I understood a little, it looks like he was unhappy for other college's job. But I didn't complain for this. Anyway he canceled my first order and made a new order list. Can you imagine what happened next ?He told me that I've also lost my 10% reward and I can't go back to the first order. Now he told me this. He didn't warn me or explain anything before asking if I cancel the first order. I got there to exchange just one of 6 items before the shipping. I didn't even think of canceling-and-reorder method, which he brought up. He definitely knew ( 100 % sure) in advance that I was gonna lose my 10% reward if I was going to go for canceling-and -reorder method. Who wants to lose the 10% back ($600) to just exchange one item's model ? Nobody is an idiot for this thing. I believe that he knew all of these consequences from the beginning and willfully didn't say anything from the beginning. It was impossible not to know I was gonna lose 10% reward , because they are selling every day the-new-creditcard-10%-reward promotion that I couldn't anticipate this result.I don't need to tell the end of this story. As you all imagine he kept saying it was my liability because I agreed to cancel . Of course they didn't apology for his negligence or ignorance. He just kept saying that I cant not go back to the first order now, Never. Where are salesmanship, due care, due diligence in these guys at Atwater store ?",0,1

I've purchased stuff from Walmart, target, kohls, you name it, and I've never had any money taken off my card until I pick the item up. This is exactly why 2 stores near me closed down. I guarantee this terrible company will file for bankruptcy in the next few years. No one wants to deal with their bs.

Best Buy,A Clown Show of a buy,"We bought an Insignia Refrigerator from Best Buy. We bought it because it received great reviews but our experience with Best Buy was horrific.

We called and they sent out a service person a week later and nothing we called again and they decided to replace it, they put an order in for a service representative to install a new ice maker, another week later. Best Buy arrived with. Replacement refrigerator, no ice maker. Called again and a week later another serviceman came out and nothing My husband read up on installing ice makers and realized none of them knew that it had been installed wrong. Our ice maker is working but it is not very good snd not worth the money or aggravation we went through. A customer representative was suppose to call us to discuss this circus of a buy but no one has called. This is why places like this go out of business!! Stay away!!",0,1
Best Buy,Expected Delivery date is a lie.,"Like most 1 stars here, their online shipping is awful. They say pretty much any item will arrive ""Next Day"", but about an hour after purchase they change the delivery to ""delayed"". Even now, the product page says ""If you order now, get it tomorrow!"". That is a lie. No expected delivery date 4 days later. It's not in high demand, it's in stock at many stores. Seems like they do this to steal potential customers from other websites. Nearly every item I've checked could be delivered one day faster than Amazon. It's a fraud. Just buy in-store (or any other store, or the manufacturer's website) if possible. I ordered a phone online because it said next day delivery, sounded easier and faster than going to the store! Of course, it got delayed without any other info. They don't allow cancellations after 30 mins of ordering.After waiting a few days with it still not being shipped, I contacted support online. They told me there was no way to cancel the order but I could buy the phone in-store and return the online delivery once it arrives. So I drive an hour to the store where the phone is in stock. Contrary to what I was told online, if the phone is with a carrier, you cannot add the in-store phone to your account (because the online phone is already added to my bill somehow?!). So what happened? After all this waiting and driving to the store, the only thing they could do was FINALLY give me a tracking number. It's still sitting at a store 2 hours away from me, and has missed 5 potential FedEx pickups. Not happy with BestBuy online. I will never order from them again and will tell everyone I know. Corporate is screwing their employees too, they need to be treated with respect. Welcome to the blacklist, BB.com. For other customers, If you don't like Amazon's (and/or BB's) business practices, check out Newegg. Ordered my last laptop from them instead of BB and got it in 2 days, as advertised. They have everything & more than BB.",0,1

Fast forward two months to today, my dryer is supposed to finally arrive after being on back order!! I call Best Buy to ask for an estimate as to when I’m supposed to receive the dryer and they tell me the order was canceled because my payment information could not be processed. Furthermore, if I were to order another one I would have to pay $200 extra than when I originally placed the order. I am absolutely screwed and Best Buy knows it.

Well that was December and now my camera and flashlight on my new iPhone 11 ( stays in a life proof case) suddenly stopped working. But I figured I was ok, since I had the awsome protection plan from geek squad. Boy was I wrong. That protection plan is a scam and a half. What they don’t tell you when they’re taking your money monthly is that if something does go wrong with your phone, your 2 options are send out your phone with no replacement, or give 1000$ deposit for a loaner. And when you reluctantly agree to one of those options after everything they’ll ask you for credit card info AGAIN in case there’s repairs?? Lol isn’t that what I’m paying monthly for? Went in to Best Buy and they passed the buck to geek squad and geek squad really didn’t care what I thought or wanted. So now my new iPhone 11, that I got at the end of December is now broken and even with a protection plan ( that has now been cancelled) I could not get it fixed or replaced without paying a bunch of money on the side of my monthly payments.

(they ship all other products within a day for some reason)I preordered Monster Hunter Rise Collectors edition months ago. Was confirmed several times with support and on their website that they would ship it on Thursday prior to release to make sure I get it on release day. Noon of release day comes around and it still hasn't shipped. I ask support and they say it still hasn't shipped, they don't know where its located, and wont get to me till 2 weeks from now. This happened as well with Ghosts of Tsushima deluxe edition. I chose to pick it up in store for that one, but they said they ""didn't have any in stock"" even though I was emailed that it was ready for pickup. They said they only had regular editions of the game. I was contacted 3 weeks later that they finally received copies of the deluxe edition but by that point I had canceled the order and just bought it digitally. I just canceled the other 4 game preorders I made for this year from them. They don't understand people want to play the game day one, not just hand them money for false products.",0,1

Best Buy,Geek Squad Completely Wasted Our Time & Money,"We scheduled an appointment with Geek Squad to get our laptop fixed. We expected a Geek Squad technician to take a look and give us a diagnosis. Instead, at this required 20 minute ""appointment"" it was just a person behind the counter plugging and replugging in the adaptor then ultimately telling us it will be free of charge and covered by warranty, which of course we were thrilled with. So we leave our laptop with them, believing that it will be fixed and free of charge under warranty (we even signed a form stating so). A week or so later I get a call from Geek Squad telling me to pay $700 to get the laptop repaired! If this had been diagnosed at our original Geek Squad ""appointment"" and had I been informed that it was going to cost me more than what I paid for it, I never would have left my laptop with Best Buy. It is a complete BAIT AND SWITCH. I declined the repair and they make you schedule yet another ""appointment"" just to come pick it up. I am already miffed at this point for the broken promise to fix the laptop, I arrive at the store and they have the gall to charge me $35 for ""shipping?"" At first he says I signed a form that says I have to pay this but when I asked to see this form he refused and said I would have to schedule another appointment. Well I read over the copy when I got home but it says nothing about paying a $35 ""shipping fee."" When I voiced my dissatisfaction with how the whole thing was handled, this ""manager"" with ZERO customer service skills begins telling me and my son that he will call the police if we don't pay and saying it was OUR fault that we broke the computer and WE should've known better about what was wrong with our laptop. Excuse me, isn't that YOUR job, and isn't that why we took it to Geek Squad in the first place, to find out what's wrong and to GET IT FIXED? My feeling is that they make these grandiose promise so you leave your computer with them, then once they got it in possession they figure you'll be desperate enough to pay the money in order to get it back. In my opinion, only con artists operate like that. Plus you can never call the store direct, it just gets connected to a call center whose representatives hung up on me TWICE. My 15 year old son had more manners and maturity than this manager at the Rockford Best Buy. NEVER AGAIN. After reading others' comments it made me see the common themes when dealing with Best Buy: Not delivering on promises, lack of disclosure, misinformation, poor customer service, baiting, dishonesty.

I found it online but due to Best Buy's price match guarantee, I drove over 15 miles (30 round trip) to the store to purchase it. I brought the online sales information with me. A salesperson at the store said they would not honor my information because the router was not being sold by the online merchant but rather being sold by this merchant on behalf of another vendor. Having read through Best Buy's pricing guarantee, this is not clear at all. It specifically excluded ""Marketplace sales"" (no definition) and some other specifics.

They put the wrong hose on our washer and even though we caught it within an hour of installation, when we called they said they couldnt have someone come out for a week. So they took my old washer and dryer, didnt hook up my new ones that I paid for installation, all new hoses and the warranty and now we're just out. Too bad sorry.

Best Buy,Simply Disgusting!,"On February 15th I purchased a phone screen protector for $30. My local store didn't have it, so it was shipped to me. I received it on the 25th. A week later or so, the adhesive started becoming loose and the screen protector began sliding up and down the screen every time phone got warm. Eventually, it just started randomly falling off my phone, essentially almost costing me my phone screen. Upon close inspection of the shield, I realized, it only adheres to the phone at its edges and the adhesive part is only about a millimeter wide, instead of being present over the whole surface of the screen - the stupidest thing I've ever seen! It should never be sold in the first place. I went to write a bad review about the product and I saw that virtually all people had the same exact problem with that product. I magically found the receipt so I decided to go return it today, March 17th. That's when I was told, sorry, you are a few days past our 2-week return policy expiration date, blah blah blah. Needless to mention, none of the policies should apply in this case. I called customer service online, but could not get them to refund me for a terrible product because it was one week past their return policy expiration date. I am so unbelievably mad at this experience that tomorrow I'm going to pack up and return a $400+ Samsung smart TV I just purchased from them last week. It will be a pain in the ass, but I'm definitely not going to do any more business with Best Buy anymore. Because it is no longer a Best Buy. It is definitely a WORST BUY.

Best Buy,Corie Barry,"Corie BarryChief Executive Officer at Best Buy7601 Penn Ave. SouthRichfield, Minnesota, 55423March 3, 2021In July of 2020,7 months ago, I treated myself to a smart TV. I made my purchase online at BEST BUY. When the TV arrived I found it had a malfunction as the bottom right corner of the screen was badly distorted which effected one third of the viewing area.I called your customer service dept. as I wanted to make an exchange. I was told that Best Buy was not taking returns due to Covid . Since Covid pandemic is a new and unchartered area, at the time I accepted this answer. I did not have the extra funds to buy another TV, so I put my old TV back up and decided to live with out a smart TV.Now seven months later, I see things a bit differently. BEST BUY took my money, but I did not get the product that would make this a square deal. Looking back, BEST BUY took advantage of the situation . I know it is after the fact. but I will never Buy another item from your company. Karl E Janesky",0,1

They keep shoving you from one recording to the next and if i cant cancel the refrigerator and get it from another company with good service, it will certainly be my last purchase, if i can cancel it, then i cant wait to never use this store again.Do not buy anything from them if you expect to need help or any customer service, unless you like waiting on hold or being ignored.

I don't know what makes Americans better than Europeans. I think we are on the same level (there in Central Europe is even more safety on the street). If it was just that they don't want to send the package far away, or it's not within their capabilities, I'll say OK, but they make it impossible to send packages to package forwarding addresses.Why are you doing this? Why does the European Union have the door open for you and not make such obstructions and you do? Shame on you! I will try to persuade European stores to prevent sales to the US. We will also play on it that we are superhumans who have higher privileges.",0,1

Told him he lost a 1000. Dollar sale he said he didn’t care, I took my mask off took a deep breath and walked out and finished up my shopping at the near by store without a mask and nobody cared or said a word other then people walk up to me all the time and thank me for some reason, that’s weird but oh well, I will never go back into that store my health comes before the douche bags unless they want to pay my hospital bill, never like the store to begin with but I was there and found another place to purchase my computer, reading the reviews I’m surprise anyone still goes there anyway.",0,1
Best Buy,Bestbuy has the worst return policy in the industry,Bestbuy is truly a bad company. I purchased a cell phone and they refused to exchange it a couple of days after their 14 days policy which is the shortest in the industry. I told the manager that if I had purchased from Amazon I would have it exchanged. He told me to buy from Amazon. Amazon is customer based but Best buy is purely profit based. When do you ever go to a bestbuy and see an employee smile? I have never ever seen an employee smile. They treat customers like it's a necessary evil to have to deal with them. I will never purchase anything again from them and suggest you do the same until they learn to value customers and increase the return policy. Their return policy is a measly 14 days. While Walmart and Target have a 90 day return policies. Home depot has a whopping 6 month return policy. Ikea has a one year return policy. I called Bestbuy corporate with my concern. The employee never called me back as promised.,0,1

No email, No responsible corporate service to escalate. Geek squad sends to corporate, corporate sends to store and store tells it's online. Store managers are literally rude as we did not purchase item from store, instead bought it online. REALLY? Rusty from Eldorado, Frisco, TX? Next time I will buy from your store sir, if you ever had the courtesy to listen to a paid customer's problem and try something from your end (at least pretend), instead of rushing to be rude, without listening and trying for a resolution.NEVER BUY from WORST BUY.

After a month I called them to find out why I didn't get my refund and they tell me that its not eligible for refund and that they shipped it to me. I did not receive the package and they told me that they cant help me with that and need to deal with UPS.

Best Buy simply emails you a link at the end of their day to have you reschedule your delivery as if your time spent waiting around for them for hours is not as valuable as there. To add insult to injury, they offer you a $25 gift card, as if your six hours of waiting is only worth $25. The customer service agents has a nonchalant response, reading from a card as if all customer's problems are the same. Beyond frustrated.

Next day called to have it looked at under the Geek Squad warranty and they told us that it was physical damage and it's not cover . Tried to explain to customer service that nobody was not within 10 feet around this TV that something else must have happened and they would not even listen to us . Asked for them to open TV and inspect inside and they refused saying they don't cover physical damage . No matter what I told them they would not listen to me and were very rude . Called Sony to have them look at TV and they don't have anyone authorized in the state of Maryland and told me that I could take it on a 5 hour journey to another state to have it looked at at my cost .

Best Buy,BEST BUY SUCKS!,"BEST BUY SUCKS!! Worst company & customer service ever!!! I used to love and trust Best Buy, but unfortunately that’s not the case anymore. You can’t ever get a hold of the actual store location that you’re trying to call. Instead, you automatically get sent to their general number and you speak with people from other countries and truly could care less about Best Buy’s customers. I’ve been on the phone trying to locate an expensive item that I had purchased. It was supposed to be delivered today. I have all the emails, etc. to prove it! When I called to find out where my item is, it took forever to get through to a representative. Once I finally did, it was clear that the rep did not like her job and didn’t want to deal with me. She hung up “accidentally”. I call back and get a hold of another representative and because she couldn’t answer my questions and she was annoyed that I had asked to speak with a manager or supervisor, she just sat there and would not speak to me. You literally could hear her breathing on the phone and when I asked why she was not talking, she would not answer. I eventually had no other choice but to hang up and try calling a third time. I wasted more time and got the run around again. None of these representatives let you speak to a supervisor/manager no matter what! That’s a huge red flag of how Best Buy is running their company!! If Best Buy continues to provide such poor customer service, I guarantee they won’t be open much longer. According to all the other reviews, many other customers are feeling my same frustration and that’s so sad. It’s not right! I will never purchase anything from Best Buy again.

We asked several times how we would get the 10% return, and were told that as soon as we paid off the purchase price on the card, we would receive a CHECK for the 10% payback. Since we intended to pay the balance as soon as receiving the card, we decided that 10% return on our $2600 purchase was considerable and we opted for the credit card. I received the card in the mail on Feb 3, 2021. The purchase price was paid in full on Feb 4,2021. There is no longer a balance on this BestBuy Visa card.On Friday. February 5, 2021 I received, by email, $245 worth of STORE COUPONS...not a check as promised. This was not an error on my part. I have a credit card which would have given me 2% CASH back, however, after being assured...more than once...that I would receive a check back if I opened a credit card account, I made the decision to get the card.I understand that stores push their employees to get credit cards from their customers. It is their business. However, outright lying to customers should not be on the table. Where is the morality in that? This was an excellent scam from BestBuy. This deceit cost me the $52 cash back I would have received from my current credit card as well as useless activity on my credit score. I have no need for $245 worth of BestBuy coupons and would never have accepted those terms. AND, oh, yes…the COUPONS are only good for 2 months!! A very sad commentary in this day when we are all struggling to make ends meet.",0,1
Best Buy,Worst store ever!,"I brought a tv at Best Buy in Oct 2020. It said in the description that the tv could be returned by Jan. 16, 2021. I didn't plan on returning a 65"" TV to their store but it kept disconnecting from my network. I called the store at the beginning of Jan and spoke to a girl about returning the TV. She said I actually had until Oct 2021 to return it. So in the meantime I brought another TV from Best Buy. After having that TV for a week, a 2 inch wide black line appeared from the top of the screen to the bottom. I couldn't believe I had gotten 2 different brand tv's from them with problems. Well, I sent my son in-law to the store with the first TV for a refund. They refused to take it back. I had to go there myself while suffering with COPD and they told me they couldn't take it back because it was past Jan 16 that I had until to return it. Good thing I took a screen shot of the return order showing I had until Oct 2021 or I would've been stuck with it. The supervisor was very rude and defensive. I told her I had another tv to return and she asked me rudely ""And what's wrong with that one?"" I told her about the line. I also told her to look at my account and see how much money I've spent there in just the past 2 years. I brought a Samsung washer and dryer in Nov 2018 that I started having problems with in the summer of 2020. Not even 2 years old yet. And now tonight my Dyson hot+cold unit I paid $350 in May 2020, won't turn anymore. I will never buy another thing from BestBuy. I think I have been receiving junk from their BestBuy Outlet at full price. DO NOT SHOP AT BESTBUY!!! I think they are going under, too.",0,1

I have no idea where it is and, I assume, the person who received it will keep it since its a computer and there is no way for them to track it down.

Best Buy,Customer Service? I think Not!,"Bought a refrigerator from them, and they delivered the wrong one. They let us keep the wrong one while they located and delivered the model we actually bought - a plus, I guess. And they did in fact, a few weeks later, deliver the right model, but the installer threw away the bypass plug for the water filter, which I need. I called to request a replacement, but BestBuy was unable (or unwilling) to send me this part. They did, however, offer, a $100 ""make-good"" compensatory payment. Despite calling several times and speaking with different service reps (sometimes after a lengthy period on hold), I never received this payment. So, I gave up, put Best-Buy on my No-Buy list, and I've moved on. Horrible company with no idea what customer service is.",0,1
Best Buy,Check out BestBuy Reviews before purchasing,"I should have read the reviews but I trusted BestBuy since it was such a big company. I fully entrusted BestBuy and made my first online order with my BestBuy card. I never received the item so when I contacted the rep, he issued the refund for me since I refused the reshipment in fear of this happening again. Weeks later, I was given the bait and switch and was emailed by a different rep that basically tells me they are no longer issuing the refund. Now I've been charged for items that never arrived and not to mention, I REFUSED THE REPLACEMENT ORDER SO I CAN INSTEAD PURCHASE IN STORE. But weeks later, I am told that they are no longer going to be honoring the refund. This is manipulation/fraud/theft combined. When I did a quick google search of them, I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. On BBB, there are numerous complaints filed each day from all over the country. I did not know just how terrible BestBuy really was. At this point, I will dispute the charge, file a complaint with Ontrac - the crappy carrier they use (OnTrac also has no regard for the customer. just do a google search on them and you'll see pictures of damaged items, horror stories, lost packages, wrong addresses, the works) and I will just close my account as I never want to shop with BestBuy again. Theyare a nightmare. I'm telling all my friends and family to watch for them. Nobody should feel safe ordering from BestBuy as they will scam you by fooling you into thinking they're a big company that you can trust. BestBuy covered all my electronic needs but now I will do what I can to spread this information as people need to know about their shady ways. Shame on you BestBuy",0,1
Best Buy,The service is a JOKE,"I ordered a washer/dryer combo on 12/22/2020.The first delivery was a 2-men crew, they said they need a 4-men crew to be able to haul away my old appliance. So I have to reschedule. I rescheduled and asked the customer service agent to make sure it would be 4-men crew the second time.The second delivery, another 2-men crew showed up, and they told me the same thing: they need 4-men crew. Ok I’m frustrated so I called BestBuy again and explain the whole mess and they promised the next time will be 4-men crew.The third delivery, which is Jan 3rd already, and well, it was still a 2-men crew. This time they told me they don’t need 4-men crew to finish the job as my corridor is too narrow anyway. So this 2-men crew was finally able to finish the job. What a joke. I then called BestBuy to complain what a joke this service is and how much trouble this caused me. They promise to send me a $110 gift card as compensation and it would arrive within 7 days. I even spoke with the “supervisor” to make sure.Well, after 2 weeks, I hadn’t received any gift card in my mail, so I called back again. The agent said it’s in process and I just need to wait patiently. Ok fine.Today, which is after another 2 weeks, still nothing. I called back again and the agent said the case was still open and never get processed, meaning if I don’t call back I’ll never seen this gift card that was promised to me. The agent said she’s able to process it and I’ll receive it within next 7-15 days. We’ll see what happen, but I’ll never be a bestbuy customer.",0,1

I contacted Best Buy and they said shince it was outside the 45 days I needed to contact Samsung. Months later I FINALLY got Samsung out to our home to inspect the TV & they said it's Best Buy delivery issue. Called Best Buy back & they said since I don't have a status or haven't spent at at certain level to get a status with them and it's been so long there's nothing they will do.

Best Buy,Too Bad I Didn't Read These Reviews First,"I bought a dishwasher and its installation from Best Buy in late January 2021. The site wouldn't let me schedule the installation. I received a text to call schedule installation. The linked site still didn't let me schedule installation. So, I called and Theresa said she'd need to forward my request to ""dispatch"" and they'd call me within 24-48 hours. That was a Friday. Having not received a call-back, I called them back the following Tuesday. They forwarded me to a woman, Elaine, who told me that since the order had been deleted for some reason from their delivery system, I needed to cancel the purchase order and re-purchase the item and installation. I went along with that and then Elaine told me they couldn't schedule installation for some reason. So, I settled for scheduling delivery and pickup off the old DW, and I'd handle the de-installation of the old and installation of the new. Good news was I saved $185 on installation! Bad news was Best Buy is a pathetic organization when it comes to scheduling and installing appliances. Never again.",0,1

I called the number back immediately. I spoke with a male customer service rep who told me that it was probably the delivery guys trying to call me even though it was a Best Buy number and even though they use a third-party delivery system, and they couldn’t call them back to let them know I was home. They immediately rescheduled my order. None of this made sense exclamation mark we spoke for quite some time because I was absolutely baffled. I canceled my order. I then saw another number on my phone and called it back and this time was routed to someone from geek squad. This woman told me a different story. She said my item was never in stock. So no one really knows what happened, and, if it wasn’tIn stock they waited until mid delivery time to let me know this? The company does not care that I am very upset about this.

Sounds like BB is a simple drop shipper now days. But guess what? I can order my own PC and have it in less than ten days also. I just thought I would support the local economy. What a lame excuse. Best Buy is no longer a place I am wasting my time with. They are nothing but a phone provider. Please Best Buy teach your employees something better to tell your consumer.

She blamed me and said that's what I ordered and hanged up.Finally after about the 6 or 7 customer service person I communicated with, he admitted they made a mistake and sent me a mailing label to send it to Purolator to return it for a refund.

Best Buy,Zero star review for customer service,"This is a zero star review for, again, customer nonservice. I tried calling my local Best Buy. The first time, I was on hold after the robovoice for 15 minutes and had to go. The second time, 25 minutes before I gave up. Add in the absolutely worst wait muzak I have ever heard - - a man whistling and repeat after repeat of inane cheery music. There's a reason I won't be buying anything from them again. How does this company stay in business??",0,1
Best Buy,Worst customer service ever!! Buyer beware.,"I am a ""Total Tech Support Member"" and bought 4 TV's and 2 sound bars, 2 subwoofers and 2 wall mounts plus home delivery service and install. Paid for everything several months prior to scheduled delivery. When construction of my house was completed, I tried to call Best Buy in Grand Junction, CO to have my purchases delivered and installed as agreed upon in writing in my purchase contract. It took me three weeks to get hold of a live person. Must have tried to call 30-40 times but just kept getting a recorded message. Finally after connecting with a live person I was informed they would not deliver and install my purchases. No specific reason was ever given. I was however refund the money I had paid for delivery and install. The lesson I learned, is to never trust Best Buy, even if you are a total tech support member,and have paid for a service upfront and have a purchase contract in writing. They seemingly will do whatever is best for them and not care about leaving a customer like me, to arrange for pick up of my purchases at store my self and additionally find an installer on my own.",1,1
Best Buy,Clearly Best Buy/Citi-Bank has more Customers than they need to be Decent to...,"I found that my payment due date was Jan 28th. So, on Jan 25, as I do not get paid until Feb 4 I called and spoke to John at BB/Citi-Bank about getting my date changed to Feb 7. John was very accommodating and took care of it for me, then sent me an e-mail confirming his decision to make the changes. Wonderful. Taken care of the way a Customer Service Corp. that relies on it's customers to survive would take care of it.Jan. 27, I get a text message from BB/Citi-Bank telling me I had better make my payment by Jan 28th or there would be a late fee, and possible mark on my credit. Confused, I found the email and yep, based on my phone call dated Jan 25, my new due date is Feb 7.So, I called BB/Citi-Bank and spoke to a woman named Georgia. Buzzer Sound - No Help Whatsoever! She then put me on hold to get me a supervisor per my request. A good five minutes later, another woman that called herself Tanna came to the phone where I had to basically explain the entire ordeal once again because obviously taking notes and writing them n the customers file for Great Customer Service simply does not take place a BB.Upon finishing my story, she tells me that it takes 2-3 billing cycles (which equates to 2-3 months) to make such changes. I asked her what I knew would be a very confusing question to her, why then wasn't I told that, and why did the rep send me an e-mail clearly outlining the new date?This is where Tanna made the biggest mistake a CSR can make with a customer. She basically told me I was lying! LOL, I guess because John failed to note my account as such, no such words were ever spoken to me, and no such email was ever sent to me... UNbelievable! I told her that I would be happy to send her the email... ""That won't be necessary"" she tells me... That even if I do have one, (she still fails to acknowledge the existence of the email) it would make no difference as they cannot change the due date that quickly... Buzzer Sound - Sorry Honey, but a company like BB/Citi Bank can make such a change asleep.Bottom Line - I was lied to, cheated, had not it been for my seeing the text message, I would have missed the chance to borrow the money and pay their chicken s*** $29.00... Clearly, BB/Citi-Bank needs that payment much worse than I do, so I borrowed the money to make sure some underprivileged CSR got their well earned paycheck.so, is this the type of company you really want to do business with?Do you want the fact that you pay their wages to go by the wayside?Do you really care if you are treated like a worthless piece of garbage to continue doing business with such people?I really think not!Fortunately, I got in on a 24 month No Interest SAC deal so they won't make a single penny from me on interest! Frankly, BB/Citi-Bank can kiss the most puckered part of my cavity!Pleased to sign,Ron MasonI have owned a collection agency for almost 15 years. If any of my employees ever spoke to a customer, debtor or wrong number the way that Tanna did, they'd immediately be out on their asses! Not only was she totally unprofessional, rude, inconsiderate and spiteful... But she made that company look petty, cheap and needy! In this time of uncertainty, the last thing a Customer Service Based Entity needs, is for their front line employees making them look bad! This woman made them look HORRIBLE! Frankly, once i have paid this no interest loan off completely.... BB/Citi-bank will never, ever lay eyes on another of my hard earn dollars or cents.... oh, and as a courtesy to my fellow consumers, I will be passing along my experience to any and everyone that has the ability to listen or hear!!! Mark my Words on that!!!",0,1
Best Buy,Price Match Scam!!!,"I’ll start by saying that the LG television I purchased is amazing. My problem is with Best Buy. I purchased the television on January 11th. My member price was $2150.00. On January 17th the same unit went on sale at Best Buy for my member price of $1950. Simple right? $200 difference owed to me. Three Best Buy support chats later, I was refunded $150 and eventually assured that the additional $50 would take up to seven addional business days. After still not receiving the $50, I have now been told that Best Buy cannot refund the member price difference. WHAT? If I would have just packed it back in the box and returned the television to the store, I would have received a full refund and could then just re-purchase the television at the new sale price. Beware of their “Price Match Guarantee”. No more Best Buy for me!",0,1

Best Buy,Unacceptably poor service,"Unfortunately, I will never go into another Best Buy. In the last two weeks I went into two different Best Buy stores in San Antonio, TX (The Rim, and Alamo Ranch locations), and not once did any one of the Best Buy associates offer assistance. I was ignored while two associates near my location talked about the upcoming college semester, had associates walk by me with products in hand (assisting other customers, I get it, but no offer of help or ""someone will be right with you""), and even some seemingly available associates just walk by me but avoiding eye contact. Best Buy is in a service industry. I should not have to request help, I should have it offered. I do not need to go through the butt pain of driving to a location, but if I do so I expect to be assisted. To top it off, the item I sought (Echo Show 8) was not in stock in mid-Jan (post holiday, no stock, I get it), but it was priced at $129.00. A quick search determined Target had 3 Show 8 in stock at my local store for $80. In any case, Best Buy proved on both occasions that they do not value in store shoppers. I will not enter another Best Buy. I even tried to call both locations to talk to or leave messages with managers, but phones went unanswered (""we are experiencing exceptionally high call volume""; no doubt regarding poor service) and no option was provided to leave a message. So I hope that Best Buy will get the message now- YOU ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS, BECAUSE/AND YOU JUST DON'T CARE.",0,1

A few days later I receive an email that mr service was complete-we didn't even hit our install appointment yet. I try to first call the newington ct store to ask if I still have my appointment on schedule. I wait on hold 50 minutes. They never come on again so I had to hang up. I ca the corporate number and get bounced around 4 times. Finally I reached someone who said they think I have the appointment still but he would call me later to confirm. Well of course no one called me back. My son gets to the appointment and he is told it will be an additional 67 dollars in parts because the system puts the wrong packages together-we were told this is a frequent event.

Best Buy,Online/Phone Customer Service,"I placed an order the morning of 1/16/21. The order confirmation indicated my order would require a signature and would be delivered by yesterday, 1/19/21. Great! I was going to be home most of the time between then and the 19th to accept delivery. Best Buy did not get the package to UPS until the evening of the 18th...how did they plan for it to be delivered to me across country by the following day from TN to CA?! So now, it has a scheduled delivery of tomorrow, 1/21/21. This is the one day this week I will not be home. I do not want my package left at my front door. I thought it would be fine because of the signature, so UPS would attempt to deliver again the following day on Friday.....But...Best Buy DID NOT SPECIFY TO UPS TO REQUIRE A SIGNATURE even though it was indicated in the order confirmation. So now, it will be left on my porch. Why is this a problem? Best Buy ships their items in the manufacturer packaging...so anyone walking down the street can see what the item is. This is not okay when the items are high valued electronics!! I tried to change the delivery date on UPS My Choice like I normally would, but because of restrictions Best Buy(!!!) put on the package I am not allowed to make changes to the delivery. I don't mind waiting a few extra days, I just don't want to deal with a stolen package.I spoke with UPS customer service, and they said only the shipper can make changes. This is a common practice of shipping companies and makes sense.So, I contacted Best Buy. Stephen Y. (who would not give me his employee ID) kept telling me to contact UPS myself. Are you kidding me?? I told him multiple time that UPS requires the SHIPPER, aka BEST BUY, aka HIM to make the change. I even provided him with the phone number to UPS. He refused to even try to call them, saying he can't do it. I asked for him to elevate me to someone who could. He did not. MOST UNHELPFUL! He kept telling me the item is already shipped....yeah, obviously!!! I have the chat transcript. If my package is stolen, it's on Best Buy. I hope it doesn't come to that, and it probably won't, but the customer service I experienced is inexcusable. There are plenty of other vendors I can purchase from in the future.",0,1

They don't know how.Delivery - hahaha, what is that? Mine was delayed for 12 days. I had to go myself and pick up my order. I picked up my order, went to the store to return it. In a store they said - you can't do this, you have to call support, they will send you a shipping label, you have to print it and send this package back. Are you ok over there????Can you imagine that? You came to the store and you can't return a product...",0,1
Best Buy,Completed online order and the next day…,"Completed online order and the next day Best Buy canceled the order. I called back and asked for a credit so I could purchase the item at the sale price (it had gone up $200). The rep agreed and said he’d offer me a credit. I ordered the item again, was delayed but came unharmed. After not receiving the credit I called CS. I was on the phone for 47 minutes and the rep tells me they can’t do a credit but can send gift cards. I explained I already purchased the item and didn’t want gift cards, I wanted the agreed upon credit (which didn’t cover the increase in taxes). He told me it wasn’t possible. Why would I want to go back into a store and buy something else after this experience? I don’t want a gift card I want a credit for the item for the agreed upon sale price.",0,1

I had taken it in a again for service and when I had gone in to pick it up it appeared to be okay, when I had gotten it home and opened it it was split in half. When I had taken it back, I demanded they give me a new laptop. They answered me with a non-acceptable answer "" that is not going to happen"".

Best Buy,Online Order,Did an online order for a TV and arrived more than 30 min as online stated it would take about that long. I pulled in and the gentleman was asking for my information and rude. He stated that I was early and they saw it in the que but it wasn’t processed yet. I then waited an additional 30 min. They acted like it was an inconvenience that I was there but I didn’t think it took an hour to take a tv off of the shelf. The only upside to this visit was the gentleman who put the tv in my truck was very accommodating and nice. I wish I had his name cause he’s the only one who deserves some stars.,0,1

Best Buy,Super poor customer service,"Best buy has been on of my favorite store for any Tech related products. Never could I have imagined that they have a super poor customer service.First the item that I ordered was delayed for a week. I been very patient and didn't complain.Then it was marked as delivered whereas I didn't receive any item. The strange part is the time stamp, the shipping info said it was out for delivery for by 4:13 pm then it was marked as delivered by 4:14 pm. Unless they could teleport to my house then it is acceptable. Then I called customer service the first guy promised me for a supervisor solution for 48 hours but no one reached out to me. Then the second guy told me it should be 7-10 business days. I didn't even asked for a 48 hours solution and yet they offered it so I was impressed at first but I didn't know that they are a bunch of liars. Then I called again, this east indian lady hung up on me when she can't give me any answers. That is super unprofessional. I was not even rude and I actually was very calm. I'm just asking for a solution.Because of this poor customer service I might never buy again from BestBuy.",0,1

The tracking number came to me in the middle of the night and was delivered by drop off. Couldn’t get it redirected to my address....UPS couldn’t help since it got delivered.

Upon delivery they discovered my washing machine had been damaged by the warehouse forklift and was crushed on the sides. They installed my new dryer and the lady on the phone said a new washing machine would be delivered with in a week and someone would call me tomorrow. An hour later water was all over my floor as they installed my dryer wrong and it was leaking. I had to reinstall it correctly. Flash forward to the next day. No one called about my washer so I called. Waited on the phone for an hour and they hung up on me. Called back and was told my new washing machine would be deliver 3/3/2021 as we are now at the back of the line for delivery.

Then, you call Bestbuy back to let them know and they said they will call UPS and give them authorization but they never did😡😡😡. Even to the point of conference calls (twice) between Bestbuy, UPS and myself but to no avail. Wow!!!

I've been super loyal to them for years and I'm sad to say it's over. I just bought a refurbished laptop from Best Buy so my daughter could continue to do remote learning. We spent our last $400 on it. When we got it, the network card was not working correctly. I'm fairly computer savvy and did everything I could to troubleshoot it myself. I called Geek Squad tech support after an hour of trying on my own. I waited an hour for someone to answer the phone. The tech that finally answered helped troubleshoot on the phone for another half hour. Nothing worked. He then told me he could remote in and troubleshoot there if I connected to an ethernet cable. I was happy to do so but then he told me I don't have a membership for tech support and it would cost and additional $199 to get his help any further. I explained that it was a newly purchased item and best Buy should stand by their own work, surely there is some grantee with refurbished items... After an hour of going back and forth, trying to convince him to help me, trying to speak to a supervisor (which never happened), he said he doesn't condone their policies but cannot help me and will not unless I pay. Completely dumbfounded by all this. Can't believe the lack of service for what you would think would be a valued customer. I told the agent if he didn't help me I was going to cancel my line of credit and never do business with Best Buy or any of their affiliates ever again. He said it is what is, he's not helping unless I pay. So I feel I have no choice but to keep to my word, end things with Best Buy, and revert to shopping online and contribute to the demise of big box electronic stores. Sorry it had to be this way best buy...",0,1

Best Buy,Don't shop at Bestbuy !,"My name is Duane Michaels. I have been a loyal Bestbuy customer for more than a decade. I bought virtually anything I needed from them out of loyalty and never price shopped. On April 20th of last year I purchased a new computer. Best buy/Geek Squad lost two-terabytes of a rare studio quality music collection that was a lifetime collection. I'm 62 years old, owned my own business all my life and have impeccable relationships with owners of billion dollar companies. Best Buy tried briefly to fix the problem and was unsuccessful. They have basically been ignoring me for the past year. If the data is lost, the value is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars lost in content and nine thousand hours of labor. There were four backups that they corrupted trying to fix the problem over more than twenty Geek Squad sessions. As of today I am spending approximately three thousand dollars out of pocket with a computer forensic lab who is working on retrieving the data. They also are able to verify the dates, times and match the corruption to the Geek Squad sessions. They provide expert witnesses to determine and testify how and when the damage occurred. Bestbuy is doing everything possible to avoid responsibility despite the fact I have both witnesses and forensic evidence that corresponds to Geek Squad doing the damage. This company has no integrity, morals or the ability to conduct business on a professional scale. They are hiding from my request to be compensated. They are forcing me to take them to court in hopes that they can operate without impunity and I might not be able to afford legal assistance and just go away. This company shouldn't be in business. They operate in a manner that is very unscrupulous and know they can. I will never by anything or reccomend anyone to shop there. Buyer beware ! This is a company that is poorly managed. Refuses to assume responsibility for their failure and does not care about your personal property regardless of how valuable it is. I'm shocked that they have destroyed all my backups and computer files. I highly suggest that you do not shop in this establishment. They shouldn't be allowed to do business ! The sad part is that despite the forensic lab verifying that the data was lost by Geek Squad, they have ignored me for the past year with vague emails and made little to no attempt to settle or fix the problem. This is not something that is in a gray area as to the damage they caused. They absolutely destroyed all my lifes work and think that they can deny it and ignore my loss they caused. I will most likely have to retain an attorney who is very confident based upon a perponderance of evidence that I will be able to defeat them without any difficulty. The forensic lab is preparing for a trial and I will have no choice except to retain counsel and let a judge and jury determine the outcome. An outcome that I documented and had a third party verify the data was intact prior to purchasing the new computer I bought. I have closed my credit cards with them and will never shop or reccomend anyone do business with this type of company. They are not a reputable company. They simply have a product that most people need. Buyer Beware ! 404-401-3400 I believe that this is a regular practice for this company. Please contact me to help possibly create a class action or mdl lawsuit against this firm. I'm almost positive that thousands of customers have had similar experiences. Sincerely, Duane Michaels",0,1

Best Buy,I am very disappointed in my recent…,"I am very disappointed in my recent experience with Best Buy. I updated my appliances with some of Best Buys top quality washer/dryer and dishwasher. Where I like the products, the installation process was a nightmare. First mistake, they delivered the dishwasher weeks before the installation date. I had the big, heavy, new dishwasher box sitting in my kitchen for weeks before they could install. To try and expidite installation, I made phone call after phone call which wasted hours of my time, being placed on hold for 30 to 50 min, only to have the connection end. So frustrating. No help. I had to wait over 3 weeks for the soonest install date. Finally, its the install date. Guess what? The guys never showed up! They had the nerve to call me at 9:30pm to ask me if they could still install the dishwasher and if not i would have reschedule. Zero customer service, just take it or leave it. So, i said I would reschedule. The next soonest date was a week later and I selected the 7am to 1pm window. Guess what? The guys didn't show until 6pm. Then to top it all off, they refused to take my old dishwasher! even though i paid for the haul away service and I showed them my email receipts they refused the haul away because they said it wasn't on their paperwork. Then the one guy said, the other guy will take it but you have to pay him cash. I was like but I already paid for this and he said he understands but not his problem. Honestly, they were hustling me. This is crazy! This is Best Buy right? Now, it's nearly 2 months later since my purchase and I still have my old dishwasher uninstalled in my dining room. So, I have to get back on the phone, calling what I now consider the Blackhole of customer service. I tried for the last week in a half to schedule a haul away service and I was temporarily getting killed with kindness from one customer service rep who was trying her best to help. She actually called me twice to say she was working on a haul away date. I was feeling some sort of relief. Then, all of a sudden this rep just dissappeared. A week has gone by since I heard from her. There's another week in a half wasted. So, today, I went to the Best Buy location and they heard my story at the customer service desk. That was wasted talk because ultimately they did nothing more then schedule a haul away 4 days from now for a 7am to 1pm window. They did nothing more than tell me they were sorry. I felt bummed but also exhausted. I kinda expected at least a refund on the $25 haul away fee, but they didnt offer and im exhausted with this so I didnt even say anything. Now, im just left so disappointed and i will never consider Best Buy for a major purchase again. Actually, I wont even buy a minor item there either. Im done.",0,1

In the end, I had a chat rep tell me that I could renew it, but that I'd have to make an appt to go to the store to do it. The site said that online scheduling wasn't available for my local store at this time, not to mention no one answered my calls to the local store. The warranty ended today, so I made a trip into the store. There were minimal lines, so I am not sure why I couldn't schedule an appt or get someone to answer the phone.

Box was opened with the tab ripped off, protector was missing it’s shield, cleaning contents to apply it and they even left the NAME of the previous customer’s pickup information on the box! Who in their right mind ships out a USED screen protector during a pandemic!!!!! So, the agent I spoke to ""made it right"" by providing a UPS return label and set up a replacement order to be delivered the same day. Four days later, NO ORDER and NOT SHIPPED. I wound up changing to in store pickup. Three more days later, I check the status on my return that I have not been refunded for, and it doesn't even appear as returned!!!! I returned it AGAINST my better judgement because I didn't want it shipped out again to another unassuming Best Buy customer. The agent literally blew smoke up my rear with concern and getting ""management involved"" to investigate how this could possibly happen. Even though I received a return UPS label from Best Buy and was shipped back the very same day, the order return wasn't even started!!! The agent I was speaking to said he would have to start the process over again and there was no indication the return was previously started, never mind shipped back. When I asked for a manager, the agent flat out refused insisting he had to process this. I finally hung up after he was belligerent about not escalating this up to a manager as requested. This was after already getting hung up on by another agent after 10 minutes on hold so he can ""look up the account details"". I called back, got another agent who processed the escalation request and said I would receive a callback. I'm still waiting for that call. Next step is reporting FRAUD with my credit card company since Best Buy doesn’t want to correct their mistake. Yes, I paid for the 2nd Zagg tablet protector, still out the money for the first USED one and these are expensive items!As an elite member, you are supposed to receive benefits with your membership. I have been with the program since its inception in the early 2000's all the way through its various evolutions to what the program is today. I have been a regular Elite Plus member for almost 10 years and it used to be a really good program with a great dedicated customer service hotline. I saw absolutely NO benefits this season. Black Friday Elite and Elite Plus early access was a joke this year. Shipping was sent USPS at a snail's pace and still have outstanding orders to date. The customer service provided by this specialized ""Elite and Elite Plus"" hotline is abysmal. You’re better off calling the regular Best Buy hotline. Picking up in store, fuhgeddaboudit!! Even if it's ""ready for pickup"", it's not ready for pickup. We waited for 3 hours on Christmas Eve to pick up a ""ready to pick up"" item which was a Christmas present. The manager wound up cancelling and reprocessing the order at the checkout counter just so we could go home because the store was closing. Why he couldn't just hand over the already paid for order was beyond me. It simply doesn't pay to spend big bucks at Best Buy anymore. It makes me yearn for the old days of Circuit City, The Wiz and other electronic retailers when Best Buy actually had to compete for their business.",0,1

Best Buy,Horrendous and Unprofessional Delivery & Installation Services,"I purchased a dryer + delivery and installation services from Best Buy online. From the moment that delivery / installation techs arrived at my door, they were belligerent. They were using a very aggressive and loud tone with me about having to carry the dryer down stairs and about being asked to wipe their boots on the mat before they walked through the house. One of the gentleman was not wearing a mask and when he did, it didn't cover his nose and only partially covered his mouth. I did not comment on this. I showed him the closet in the basement where the dryer was to be installed, his immediate response was that the duct wasn't installed properly and he needed to break down the wall to install it. He was adamant that he could not install the dryer.When I tried to understand this better and asked some questions - I even asked if he could just drop it off and I would take care of the installation - he started yelling at me very very loudly to the point I got scared and I ran up from my basement to get my phone. He stomped out of my place and instructed his co-driver to put the dryer back in the truck. I've called Best Buy and asked them to cancel my purchase and refund my money. What I thought would be a simple and straightforward delivery and installation, turned into such a time consuming, difficult and disappointing experience. Would recommend not buying installation services from best buy.",0,1
Best Buy,Delayed order limbo since December 14,I ordered a tv on December 14. The order is delayed. Its now Jan 5 and no status updates. Ive chatted with 3 different reps.

Best Buy,I have been patiently waiting for a new cpu.,"I have been patiently waiting for a new cpu that is in high demand. This morning I received an instant notification of restock for the cpu I am shopping for. I went straight to Best Buy to make my purchase and when I pressed the add to cart icon Best Buy took over and refused to add my item to the cart. Their website then started a buffer that stalled the add to cart button. After refreshing the page it did it again and again. With a message from Best Buy that stated: Because of demand we are making customers go through an extra step to add this item to cart. Wait for the add to cart button to reappear and then proceed. Unfortunately by the time the buffer ended the item had sold out. Because Best Buy delayed my purchase it sold out and literally stopped me from having a chance to make my purchase. I believe this is opposite of what Best Buy is trying to accomplish.However, controlling the purchase in this manner is bias and a great inequity. Let those who are able to complete the normal purchase procedures decide who gets it. I found it highly unprofessional and felt like I was being forced to play a game because of being prevented from continuing with my purchase.I will not be purchasing anything from Best Buy ever again.Worst customer service/ shopping experience I have ever had. What happened to first come first serve?",0,1
Best Buy,Bad Business Policies,"I had a protection plan on a one year old phone. The store promised a gift card to use towards a new phone. I never got it. I even sent the broken phone back, but never got compensated with the gift card. When I try to call, I am put on hold for hours. When I try to chat, same thing. One time, after about an hour on hold, I asked for the manager, who told me to call him if I never got the gift card. The person who answered the phone, put me on a brief hold and then disconnected me. This store does not care about customer satisfaction and is not operating a business based on integrity.",0,1

Best Buy,Poor Customer Service and Loyalty,"This review is for Best Buy and it's customer service. I am very disappointed. I submitted my order #BBY01-806397795982 back on 12/17/20 to purchase an Arlo doorbell camera for $99.00, the deal included a smart clock. After a few days, I was told my order would be delayed which I am ok with and was willing to wait. However, what I am not ok with is after the new year I was notified by Best Buy that my order was automatically canceled. After checking the website and finding that the Arlo doorbell I was seeking was in stock but at a higher price, I decided to call Best Buy Customer service for an explanation. The agent had no legitimate explanation and offered no solution to my problem only to say that both he and his supervisor could not reinstate the order. In the past, I have never had a bad experience with Best Buy. I always received what I ordered and this was what I was seeking when I made the call. In my opinion, this is bait and switch at its best. It's very unfortunate because as a customer trying to buy from local businesses, I am being snubbed from a legitimate purchase at the expense of a company seeking to beef up it's bottom line vs. customer satisfaction. Well, this dissatisfied customer will not be making purchases from Best Buy anytime soon.",0,1

Best Buy,WORST BUY,I do not want to even give one star. I ordered two items to be delivered in time for Christmas. I ordered on December 12th. One arrived on time and the other is lost somewhere. I called tonight to see why the item was stuck at a post office since 12/15. I spoke with one rep and she disconnected me when she failed to answer my question as to what my options were. The second rep did the same. I finally found a rep that was smart enough to reship the item. I cannot believe the incompetency and bad customer service. I will never order anything online from this store again.,0,1
Best Buy,DotCom & Delivery,"This review is for the online experience at BestBuy.com, I haven't had any major issues in store ever. Ordered three items, to be delivered together. The charges for the items were split instead of being taken all at once, and possibly double or even triple charged. Thought it was identity theft at first, but ran the numbers and it appeared to match up, though pending charges for the full amount were also listed in my statements. Waiting for that to shake out, but could be a major issue. Usually my online purchases are a single, near instant or one day lump sum so this is quite strange to begin with.My orders arrived in a box far too large for the items, that was totally demolished. One of the items was fine with some minor damage, the other was in a box that was totally popped open and missing pieces (mounting parts for a pop filter).",0,1

I tried to reschedule multiple times and each time the appointment never happened and I got automated messages to reschedule even after rescheduling directly w customer service on the phone. Tried again today to reschedule after another cancelled appointment and customer service agent told me he couldn't do anything, the driver must have made a mistake, the system was having a problem and was sending me in an infinite loop. He said if I were you I'd call the store where I bought it. Been on hold now w the store's automated system for a total of 50 minutes-no one has ever picked up. I just want my dish washer installed or my money back!",0,1

Best Buy,One star is a generous rating,"I will start out by saying that this is my 3rd or 4th terrible experience with Best Buy. On 12/30 I purchased a TV, fire stick & fire stick protector and they were guaranteed to be delivered by 9pm on. 12/31. At 6pm on 12/31 an email came that my ordered was delivered. I went down to the package room in my building and found the fire stick and the protector, but no tv. I went on the Best Buy website and got ahold of a rep on their live chat feature. after a solid 30 minutes of providing info and holding I was assured that the tv was still en route and coming that evening and would be at my home by 9pm. When 9pm came andWent I decided to call customer service. The rep first tried to lie to me by telling me that the package could not be delivered because I did not put my apartment number on my order when. I placed it. That’s impossible as I ordered all the items together and the 2 things that came had my apartment number right on the box. At this point Inrequested to speak with a manager. The rep informedMe that a supervisor would call me right back. This of course never happened. The following day I call customer service again and explain the situation to another rep who is quite empathetic, although completely unhelpful. This rep assures me that the tv is on a truck and out for delivery that day. Again Inwait all day and no delivery ever comes. I make ‘more calls and attempt to get a supervisor on the line. All attempts are unsuccessful and twice I amOut on hold and then hung up on. On 1/2 with no answers and no idea when my tv might come I am forced to contact my credit card company and dispute the charge.This is the last time I ever attempt to purchase anything from Best Buy. Poor and dishonest customer service is inexcusable. Shame on this company.",0,1

I wanted it to be a surprise and I was also excited since its a brand she really like.

Christmas came and past still nothing then we call again, it was monday and BEST BUY Rep say they will order another watch to be send to the store for pickup on friday. Just after 2:00am friday I got a text that my item was no longer in stock at that location. From what we understand is that the item would be coming from another best buy location. The watch was on sale for about $119 and at the time they resend it the item was no longer on sale by the it went back to its original price of $300. This was the worst experience. I feel like they lie to us from the beginning. I will never buy anything from BEST BUY again.",0,1

The return experience to the store only made delivery experience worse when I encountered the manager on duty he never asked any questions he never apologized he never made one-on-one communication with me about my issues only spoke to the associates and told them to tell me what my return options were again very unprofessional.

The BestBuy customer representative response was. “Why you fix an appointment on your working day/!!!!!!!!” Can you believe this????? I would accept the statement if they would have delivered the item. Here I am after more than a month still waiting for the item and today is the third time they have not shows up probably they just didn’t feel like it.

I promise to stay away from this company and this one is honest promise will never advise my friend to order anything from this company.

They are extremely slow and seem lost. It started with a call to fix an installed dryer. They were 11 days wait time until an appointment available. I took it. It was an 8 hour window for the service but no one showed up. I called the following day to see what went on and I was told there were no notes about why the appointment was no fulfilled. After 18 minutes on the phone with another rep that seemed clueless, I was offered another appointment 15 days out. This was not acceptable and I asked for a supervisor. I was told I could get transferred to a supervisor and he attempted 4 times but kept coming back on the line. After being told he was waiting for a supervisor to be available and kept saying “he’s almost here”, he eventually left the call and I had the usual hold music.

The one thing I need to get the whole system working is the soundbar which they want a signature for. No other item was shipped signature required. We were then told the 29th between 12:00 and 8:00 PMfor the soundbar but someone would call us beforehand to narrow down the time. No call. No delivery. Then we were told the 30th between 12:00 and 8:00 PM. No call. No delivery. In between, calls placed to Best Buy were only answered by a human after a 45 minute wait. No resolution.

Best Buy,Total lie about delivery date,"Total lie about delivery date. I ordered a Sony Blu-ray disc player. According to the Best Buy site, I could get next day delivery. That was on December 28. I figured fine. So, I ordered and waited the next day. I decided to check on the order status in the afternoon of the 29th. Big surprise, delivery date was now by January 12! I tried to cancel the order online, but the option to cancel is locked. The explanation is ‘We’re working on your order. At this point, we can’t cancel it.’ Today is December 30. Still cannot cancel the order and no shipping status given. Of course, the unit hasn’t been delivered. If I reorder it, the site still claims next day delivery. I thought I could protect myself from exposing myself to any Covid-19 threats by staying at home. I am in a high risk group, 68 years old and have had two open heart procedures.Had I known Best Buy would blatantly lie about delivery, I would have never ordered from them. I could drive to Best Buy in about 15 minutes and picked it up myself. They are in stock at that store. I thought I was helping a local merchant. The same unit is available at Amazon for the same price with two day delivery. It is available online (from the east coast to California) with free shipping delivered by January 5. Only Best Buy is delaying the delivery. I think they are just keeping my money and deliberately holding the item not allowing a cancellation.I will order from another retailer. When the Best Buy order shows up, I will take it directly back for a refund. I have had other online orders with Best Buy in the past, but this is the first time they have given a flat out lie about delivery. I’m very disappointed in Best Buy and if this is their new policy, there are plenty of other retailers who would welcome our business. This is an obvious Bait and Switch which will chase loyal customers willing to help the local economy away.",0,1

Tried to get a refund or a new one shipped to a store so I could pick it up and was told that they couldn't refund me, and to contact the ""carrier."" I can't afford to just lose a hundred dollars like this, especially in the middle of a pandemic. A horrible, cruel experience overall. Won't be shopping here again.",0,1
Best Buy,never again!!,"I own a hair salon and I ordered a washer dryer combo 6 weeks ago. In those 6 weeks they rescheduled my delivery FIVE times. 3 out of those 5 times, they never emailed me the night before, they just didn’t show up during the window provided for delivery! Customer service didn’t give a crap that I was an unhappy customer. I requested a refund and at least they got that right. NEVER AGAIN!!’n",0,1
Best Buy,Very Poor Customer Service,"I ordered a new cell phone with Geek Squad coverage on Nov 7, 2020. It was ordered online with Live Chat, with the plan to go to store and pick up later that evening. Each time I put my credit card info in, it initially went thru and I received an email confirmation of the purchase, then a couple minutes later, I receive an additional email stating that Best Buy cancelled the order. I tried different cards with the same results. I called each bank to make certain there was no issue. There was none. I finally was able to get the phone-on a different card, went to the store and picked up the phone. Then a few days later, ALL OF THE PRIOR CANCELLED PURCHASES WENT THROUGH. Unbelievable! Since then, I have been trying to get these additional charges refunded. Today is 12/30/20 and I am working on the last refund. Best Buy partially refunded me for some unknown reason on this last card and is having difficulty figuring out what they did or what went wrong. I have been on hold now for 43 minutes and 40 seconds and the ""helpful"" agent, just put my call back into the general queue. I am so disappointed in this whole debacle and in the way Best Buy treats its customers. After waiting it out, the next person who picked up was, of course, brand new to my issue and then says he is actually from Geek Squad and cannot help me so he must transfer me. This is so frustrating. I am sure Best Buy will not complete the refund.UPDATE: I have now been on the phone with them for 1 hour, 22 minutes and have been helped by a third agent (Stella) who put me on hold for the umpteenth time and then when she came back on, pretended to have phone trouble and could not hear me, then she just hung up on me. I SIMPLY CANNOT BELIEVE THIS COMPANY!",0,1
Best Buy,Save Yourself from Best Buy,"I scheduled 1 appliance return pick up which turned in to 4 appointments due to their no shows, no calls and cancellations. Return order #1120351535122. The Company has arrived outside of time required by the co-operative on first attempt. 2nd attempt company sent two confirmation emails and a third email indicating their on the way but never showed. 3rd scheduled date, appointment confirmed twice during day by email and 5 phone calls of which 2 got me through to an agent. Not trusting this, phone call 6 after 25 minutes tells me the truck has broken down and I must reschedule. Now I want a supervisor and I’m on hold an additional 32 minutes. FGO Logistics is the trucking company. This is a Best Buy subsidiary I am told. The agent I’m speaking with is in Panama and I was just disconnected. She was the only agent who actually tried to call FGO. All the others could only send an email. Do not order major appliances through Best Buy especially on line. This has been such a negative experience but I’ve ordered from Pressers who gave me better quality appliances at an excellent cost. I will be placing these Best Buy refrigerator, range and microwave curbside if not retrieved by January 2 the 4th appointment.",0,1

Once they have it with them then they don;t care to take care of their customer needs or convenience. they will send defective items and their installer are the worst in the world. The installers will dictate you and if something is not convenient to them they will ditch you in the middle and walk way. They will bring the appliance drop it in the street curb and drive away. Even if there is an installation schedule the installer's dont care about that because you have already paid the money. I donot know how such people are even permitted to do business in this part of the world. If it is the govt for the people then these stores should be ordered to be closed by the court and not allowed to operate at all. Worst store and nobody should do business with this company.",0,1

Best Buy,Unhappy at Christmas,I placed two orders on BestBuy.com for in store delivery. One on 12/3 and one on 12/6. Neither item arrived in time for Christmas. I had to go in the store to get a resolve for one order. The second order has yet to ship and I have an install date of 1/6. I have chatted and called and visited the store still to no resolve. I have arranged to be off work for my 1/6 install and I do not think my remote start will be shipped by then. I called in 12/29 and was hung up on after waiting on hold for 8 mins. I tried to chat in and the chat is not accepting new chats. I will never order anything from Best Buy again. This is insane.,0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy customer service and home…,Best Buy customer service and home delivery service is terrible. They did not ring the doorbell when they came out I didn’t know they were outside.

Best Buy,After spending tens of thousands of…,"After spending tens of thousands of dollars with this company I called today because my dryer was flooding my laundry room. They told me it would be over a week before anyone could come to stop it, but that I could call LG to have the appointment moved to something sooner. I called LG only to find out that best buy had actually scheduled my appointment for a ""top loading washer"" when it's my front loading dryer that is flooding my house. I had given the serial number for the front loading dyer when scheduling the appointment. LG told me I had to call best buy back to get the appointment fixed to the correct appliance and also they would have to be the ones to move my appointment time to a sooner time. I called back and a lady was super rude telling me that there was no way she could move my appointment to any sooner and it's too bad if my house floods in the meantime. She then put me on hold and hung up on me. I am beyond frustrated and not sure why we spent so much on the extra warranty for all of our appliances we bought from them if this is how they respond when we have an emergency.",0,1

Best Buy,Two no showsFor my washer and dryer delivery not even a call,We bought a washer and dryer and spent over $2000. It was to be delivered between one and 6 PM. The night before they called and confirmed between one and 6 it would be delivered. They never called and at 6:45 sent us an email to say they’d be at our house in five minutes and they did not show up. When we finally got hold of an actual person they told us they have no way of tracing the delivery service then they said delivery was canceled and rescheduled and when we asked who did it no one knew. So today is the day that it was rescheduled for between 7 AM and 1 PM it is now 2 PM without a call or a washer and dryer and when we try to find out what is going on they can’t reach the delivery people. We went to the store directly to cancel now and was toldWe can’t cancel while it’s in transit LOL seriously?! In any event we canceled and will deal with PC Richards again as always never a problem and at least they show up. We will never never buy from Best Buy again,0,1

Best Buy,Zero stars!!,Zero stars!!! We ordered an Apple Watch 12/9/20. The site clearly stated it would be delivered in two days. On the day it was supposed to be delivered I checked the updated status. They said it was out for delivery. It never came. The next day I checked the status and it said shipping delay. I called Best Buy customer service. It was hard to understand them. They told me that the watch was delayed because they were waiting for the shipper to pick it up. Which makes no sense. We waited a week and called again. They told us the same thing and would not let us cancel the order. Then we called a few days later and the lady told us it was going to be delivered on Christmas Day. Which is an obvious lie. The watch unexpectedly showed up on 12/23. Two day shipping was more like two week shipping. I am done with Best Buy. The part that was most upsetting was we would check the website and they were still telling other people if they purchased an Apple Watch it was 2 day delivery. I am sure a lot of Best Buy customers didn’t get their gifts in time.,0,1
Best Buy,I’m very disappointed,"I’m very disappointed. I ordered a computer a month ago... they told me it was delayed and would be shipped in a few days, that was 10 days ago. Then I tried to chat with an agent online... they told me it was out of stock ... they when I tried to ask more questions they disconnected from me. Then I found another computer online in a store, bought it, they sent me a pick up time... then 4 hours later they wrote and said it was out of stock, and I got the familiar delayed message. Why would you advertise a product knowing you don’t have it and won’t be getting it for a long while. Best Buy needs to be honest with its customers. If they would have been I could have been looking for a computer else where. Instead it’s Christmas and everyone is out of stock. Bad business if you ask me. Be more professional . I won’t be shopping at Best Buy again.",0,1
Best Buy,Stop with the ads...I already bought it weeks ago,"Best Buy is in the business of making money, I can't fault them for that.This is also a petty item compared to all the other nasty reviews here. My beef is with the ads that incessantly pop-up when I'm reading online news. Christmas is over Best-Buy, I bought this stuff weeks ago, you can stop showing me ads for stuff I already purchased. You should think about re-writing your algorithm, it's not cost effective. You should also think about replacing your advertiser, they can't seem to get their ""already purchased"" button to work correctly. There also doesn't seem to be a way for me to contact the company directly to convey my concerns, so the only way to alert them to their waste is on a public forum like this one.Since Best-Buy paid for the ad space on these news sites, they can pretty well do as they please. And I, as a consumer, am also free to do as I please, and will follow the advice of the many other reviews here and just stop going to Best-Buy. I fail to see the incentive for me to shop there.",0,1
Best Buy,0 Stars!! You have been warned!!,"0 Stars!!! Never use Best Buy to order products! You have been warned!I purchased a few pricey gifts for my son weeks in advance before Christmas. Order went through, delivery scheduled for Dec.24 and everything was moving on time. Until I checked the order status on Dec. 24 which now updated the delivery date to Dec. 28?! I call UPS as I see the packages are in-transit with them. UPS tells me that the shipper, Best Buy, used a cheaper service called Sure Post that UPS offers, which hands the package off to USPS (snail mail post office) to deliver the package. What a scam! So in order for Best Buy to cut on shipping costs, they cuts costs at the customers expense. If they offered the extra cost at check out I would have paid it. But no, they didn't. Could it be that they are trying to compete and give you a bait and switch until they get their crap together?If you order from Best Buy, so be it. But don't expect much but ridiculously long wait times and delays. #bestbuy#scam#inferior#electronicsmiddleman",0,1
Best Buy,Longtime super fan of Best Buy,"I have been a super fan of Best Buy for many years.....even decades. That all came to an end this week when they made a mistake on my rewards purchases and refused to correct their mistake. This ended up costing me about $100 in missed reward credits. After going to my local retail store to get the matter resolved, they could not help me. Neither did their premiere department that I reached through calling their 888 number. Basically they admitted their mistake and said they could do nothing. Even after providing proof of payment in the form my the posted check. They really make it difficult to support local establishments. I am saddened by this as I do like several of the sales people at this organization. I will absolutely be shifting a great deal more of my purchases to Amazon. Their customer service is superior in my opinion...as well as having safeguards to protect their customers.Happy Holidays!!!",0,2
Best Buy,"Terrible, empty promises","I have an expensive parcel that I ordered on the 1st of December. The Updates kept telling me different delivery times, and now it hasn’t updated since the 5th even though I’ve talked to four representatives. The first one said “please do not worry you will get it within 2-3 business days” it never came and then 7 business days later I talked to another representative and they promised me that my parcel was going to be delivered by the 20th. It never came. On the 21st the third representative said it would be here in 24-48 hours and if it wasn’t then I can get a refund. It’s been longer than 48 hours and now apparently they’re doing an investigation for a lost shipment trace that can take up to 10 days?? when the day before they told me “Please do not worry the parcel is safe”. I keep getting promised different times and I’m annoyed. The parcel is coming from 5 hours away and it hasn’t gotten here in almost a month. I’d like a refund at this point since it looks like I’m not receiving my parcel, and no representative is listening to me. I understand it’s Christmas but don’t promise people a delivery time if you don’t know when it’s going to arrive. Not impressed and NEVER bringing my business here again.",0,1

In an online chat with a so-called customer service rep, she said Best Buy does not carry computer batteries but if I found one, they would install it for $60-$70. (Absolute rip-off. Who can't install a battery?) She said I should have purchased the extended warranty and instantly terminated the chat. When I tried to get a copy of the chat, there was a message about a problem with the system, and the text was irretrievable. The rep was rude with her flippant comment and hang-up. The system 'problem' protected her. I have spent more than $3000 at BB in the past year. My wallet and I will not be back.",0,1
Best Buy,Terrible Company - don't order anything from them!!!,"I ordered a washing machine from Best Buy which was supposed to be delivered and installed today.

I eventually spoke to a supervisor, Fred B., who was rude, spoke over me, and refused to help. This is the 2nd time I've had a delivery/installation issue with Best Buy - I boycotted them for years. I was hoping that it would be a positive experience this time, and it was until it came time to deliver and install the machine. This is my first purchase since then and it will be my last.",0,1

I tangled with online support for 45 minutes and was finally told I would have to take my online only order refund request to the local store which NEVER answered their phone over a period of weeks.What follows is Best Buy's policy, which I copied from their website:*We match our online and app prices on in-store purchases and our in-store prices on online and app purchases.*If we lower our in-store, online or app price during the return and exchange period, we will match our lower price, upon request.*Our Price Match Guarantee covers new items (excludes clearance and open-box items). One price match per identical item, per customer, at the current pre-tax price available to all customers is allowed.I say my purchase falls within the guarantee outlines EXCEPT that they had an addendum posted a week later saying they would not honor their policy between Black Friday and New Year's.

After ten more minutes of waiting, she comes back and says ""Well, we can refund your order, but in the instance that the package does come, you have to drive to a Best Buy store to return it or we will take the $64 back again"". Are you kidding me? Hours of my time spent waiting on hold with your ""customer service"" just for me to get treated like garbage and STILL NOT GET MY PACKAGE? Absolutely ludicrous.

I found out the item was coming from a warehouse located in the small city I live in. Then later found out they lost the item...all after they sold more to other people and now claim the only thing they can do is refund me. Thanks for showing me why Best Buy is going under.

Best Buy,Is there not a zero star option?,Is there not a zero star option? I bought a Bissell Steam Mop online Friday and paid $10 more than Amazon because I thought the service would be better at Best Buy if there were any issues with delivery and I needed before Christmas. I was wrong. It said same day delivery. Great! Didn't come Friday and not a big deal because I do not need it until Christmas. Didn't come Saturday. But online said it was being delivered and couldn't be canceled. Same thing Sunday. Same thing Monday. Could not reach anyone online or on the phone. Went the local store and they said it showed delivered. But online in my account it shows out for delivery. They said I would have to call 1800BESTBUY. Called and was on hold for 42 mins and was disconnected. I am on hold again but have very little faith. No online chat available.

Best Buy,I am writing a review here because I do…,"I am writing a review here because I do not have a Best Buy account to log into nor do I want one. Good morning we were in Best Buy to purchase an I Pad as a Christmas gift. The location in D'Iberville did not have it in stock so the nice young man checked stock in Gulfport, they had it in stock so we made the purchase in the D'Iberville store, he said it should be ready for curbside pick up in about an hour, so we set out to Gulfport to pick it up. (We had other options at this time.) We arrived about 35 minutes later, we wanted to look around and see if we could add any other gifts, so we went inside, we were told repeatedly that you can't come in and pick up your item you must wait outside! We shopped around, thinking we would just go out when it was ready, after two hours in the store looking at appliances for an upcoming home renovation, we decided to go get some lunch. We returned to check on our package. We were then told ""we have more than 300 orders to pull and not sure when we will get to yours"". ( Other options running out.) We thought we were doing good, made the purchase, went to pick it up, wanted to spend more in the store, good customers, so you would think. We said fine we would just spend the extra two and half hours on the road and come back tomorrow. At about 9:30 p.m. my wife received an e mail saying that "" your item is currently unavailable "" this is nine and a half hours later. ( Other options are gone.) This reminds me of the computer we bought some years back from Best Buy (we did not buy the protection plan ) and there was an issue with the laptop from the factory and the store would not help return it to the manufacturer, and every other time that they don't care that you are a customer, because there are plenty of other people out there willing to shop at their store. In short this boils down to once they get you it the store and have your money they really don't care about you or whether you are satisfied with your purchase or have a good experience with them, ( they have the dollar you spent ).LET ME BE CLEAR WHEN I SAY THIS "" I WOULD RATHER TRADE BEANS WITH A GODLESS MERCENARY FROM A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY THAN SPEND ANOTHER CENT IN BEST BUY, my wife said some people would not get that symbolism, so I WOULD TRUST A CRACK HEAD WITH A BEAT UP BOX SELLING AN I PAD AS NEW BEFORE I WOULD BELIEVE THAT BEST BUY WOULD HAVE DECENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Best Buy,Came into store to purchase a 700…,"Came into store to purchase a 700 dollar tab waited at the counter to have someone get it out of the display case, the worker looked in the case then looked to his phone and tells me we have 11 in stock they are just stored elsewhere 5 minutes goes by he returns and says haven't forgot about you still looking I see him flag a manager down inquire about where they are she proceeds to ask another employee and off thr three of them go 20 minutes goes by and the original employee says sorry we can't find them you can pay for one here and then drive 45 minutes to pick it up from another location or we can have it delivered to you in 4 days i tell him I'll just order online myself which I did got a email saying order was received and would arrive in 4 days, after 2 days I got another email saying the item is out of stock and will arrive after a month no apology from anyone in store or online thanks best buy for screwing up another Christmas gift for our son who was home from the army now he is forced too receive hist gift mid january",0,1
Best Buy,Save yourself a bitter experience,"BEST BUY and SAMSUNG as a partnership are substandard and not to be trusted as they do not stand behind the product that they sell. Bought a Samsung dishwasher DW80F600UTS/AA. This model leaks and leaks bad. It turns out they installed a rubber insulation at the bottom of the door that cannot be replaced. I will repeat, the insulation at the bottom of the door cannot be replaced! You actually need a new door to stop the leak. You may ask next how much is a door? $400! They know this is a problem so they have discontinued the model. Do they help those who were unfortunate enough to buy this? No! They have no sentiment for their sucker costumers. Do yourself a favor, buy from another company AND another appliance store.They will not help you when you have a problem. And, you will, if you buy a Samsung or any other product sold at BEST BUY",0,1
Best Buy,WORST STORE ON THE PLANET,"WORST STORE ON THE PLANET! Better off going to Walmart at midnight. Prices are horrible and customer service is abysmal. Just wanted to get a service and when they could not do that in less than 4 days, was going to buy it myself. They would not let me do that until I went back through the line for a service ques. Are you kidding me? Purchased a better product from Amazon. There is NOTHING in that store that is priced right. There is NOTHING in that store that would make me want to go again.",0,1
Best Buy,Do NOT get their warranty protection plans,"I purchased an Xbox One Controller in May of this year and was pitched & sold the 3-yr warranty that it would cover ALL damage to the controller - including physical - and that it was good for 1 claim a year for 3 years. In other words up to 3 claims. However, now that I have to make a claim for it, as my son broke his controller, I'm being given the run-around and being told it does NOT cover physical damage. After arguing about it, they finally agreed to cover it and are sending me a replacement but this concludes my warranty and I can not make any more future claims on it. What a scam! Do not buy in to their BS pitch when you are purchasing anything. They tell you one thing to make the sale and then something completely different when you try to hold them accountable for it. Yet another disappointing interaction with this company. I'm done with them. I hate to say it but I'll go to Amazon for my technology items from now on...at least they honour their sales and returns are easy and painless",0,1
Best Buy,BEST BUY- THE WORST FOR KITCHEN APPLIANCES,"They are the worst for Home Appliances and installation. DO NOT BUY ANY APPLIANCES FROM THEM AND HAVE THEM INSTALLED. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE DAYS AND MAKE MISTAKES. THEY CAME TO UNISTALL A MICROWAVE AND PUT IN ANOTHER ONE. WELL THEY DIDN'T BRING THE NEW MICROWAVE, SO I HAVE BERN WITHOUT AN OVER THE STOVE MICROWAVE FOR 3 WEEKS. THEY KEEP CHANGING MY INSTALLATION DATE AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE A MICROWAVE.I WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE TO PURCHASE BIG APIANCES FROM PC RICHARDS OR SEARS. THEY ARE REPUTABLE AND DEPENDABLE.",0,1
Best Buy,STAY AWAY FROM BEST BUY!! Products are promised available until you pay.,"I have bought items from Best Buy for years and loved the quality and customer service. That is until this year. The availability of items is very misleading. You get a delivery date and recently I ordered the Air Pod Pro which was in stock and would be sent out next day. Approximately 6 hours later at 3:15 in the morning I received an email that they weren't available and that if they couldn't ship by December 23rd they would cancel my order. My appliance order was charged to my account and three delays later and 5 months until the promiced delivery I cancelled the order, which took three days. I'm di=one with Best Buy, NEVER AGAIN!!",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy=waste your time and waste of money,"If you want to waste 8 hours on the phone speaking to 15 different people who could care less about your customer experience, then make your purchase at Best Buy. They have hired the most incompetent 3rd party delivery team. The delivery just didn’t show up and no one knows where my appliance is? No one cares. Best Buy should be reevaluating their business model. What business model has a 1 star on Trustpilot? There is zero accountability or follow through by the multiple customer service reps, customer service manager, or the 3rd party delivery vendor. Hand them your hard earned money and all you will get is a headache, frustration, and a company that doesn’t care. And for all those employees at all of the customer service call center....say bye to your jobs. At a bare minimum, pretend you care since it was obvious that no one actually cared or were willing to do any work to find a solution. If you don’t care about the customer, the customer will go somewhere else to purchase. There are a lot of competitors out there and consumers now have access to every single negative experience. As a larger organization, you are a benchmark for the industry and your benchmark is riddled with poor customer experiences. The central theme for Best Buy’s business model is to ensure that the customer will be abandoned when something goes wrong. The outrageous number of 1 star reviews should be an eye opener to the employees of Best Buy and to the executive team. I am in the Seattle WA area. The manager of your 3rd party vendor delivery team does not care to represent your company in a positive light. They are only interested in making money and they just won a contract with your competitor, Lowe’s. If they already have a problem delivering for Best Buy on time.....you think they can handle more jobs with Lowe’s? Lesson learned....do not purchase anything that requires delivery from Best Buy or Lowe’s unless you want to invite frustration and zero support and resolution into your life.",0,1
Best Buy,**WORST** BUY,"I've made thousands of dollars of purchases at Best Buy over the past 15 years. Never, never again!I just spent 3 hours - yes - you read correctly - THREE HOURS on the phone with Customer Service at Best Buy to try and find out exactly why I cannot access my Best Buy account online. Mind you - not the Best Buy site for making payments.... CiTiBank - I mean the site Best Buy has for Members where your purchases are retained, rewards points are reflected and also linked to the credit card information. After attempting to login over 25 times and their site stating they do not recognize my email - I became so furious and frustrated I decided to call today.One off-shore person after another!!! Not one English speaking American on the line in any of the 4 times I was handed off to yet another foreigner. UNACCEPTABLE!!! You want Americans to buy at your stores - equip your Customer Service lines with Americans.After 3 hours of jibberish apologies and excuses guess what??? No decent outcome. I still cannot access my Best Buy account online. Funny... how CitiBanks emails come through JUST FINE FOR PAYMENTS and my money. Well... I am done... I will never ever buy another appliance, TV or any other product from this loser company. I am in the Customer Service industry - YOU DON'T TREAT CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS!!! Goodbye Worst Buy and good riddence.",0,1
Best Buy,85 in TV purchase…,"This is not about the 85 in TV I bought but it's about the purchase that I am going through with pain. I bought two 85 in tv from bestbuy, one in store and one online. I then returned the one that I bought in store. Online agent told me to come to the store to set up a pick up for my return because the tv is so big. When I got to the store they asked me to call bestbuy online store to set that up. Finally I got it picked and delivered back to Bestbuy. I waited for 10 business days to call them for a refund. They refunded me pretty quickly on the phone but I saw the refund amount is for the TV that I bought online and not the one I returned. Somehow I got disconnected on the phone. I called back and talked to another agent. I told them basically I just wanted a refund for the item that I returned and for the amount that I paid for it. The agent said that they cannot do anything for a store purchase return. I then came to the store but they couldn't fix the issue either and I have to wait for them to contact someone to take a look. I have be an Elite Bestbuy customer for years but all my trust to it will go away after what happen this time. What I want to say is, each agent tell me different thing. The first agent refund me with wrong amount from another order. Phone disconnected and didn't call me back even though they asked for my phone, email, home address before we started the conversation. Second agent when I called back say ""we cannot process refund for in store purchase, You need to go to the store to fix it."" I wonder why, the first agent processed it without any problem. You need to let me know in the first place then I can go to the store to avoid the mess up. From your website, return policy and price match seems to be very nice and unbeatable, but when I got in to the situation, then it's a nightmare. it's not straight forward at all. If bestbuy customer care reads this, you can take a look into my account and see what I meant from my account record. Lastly, my advise for other consumers out there, you need to pay attention or look into it more for what bestbuy posts on the page where you buy the item about all of their return/price match policy,I swear to God this is my last purchase from bestbuy.",0,1

Another representative told me I will get it on the 23rd, while another representative said the item will only be shipped on the 23.

Best Buy,slipshod piece of work,"Wow, what a hustler. After speaking with BestBuy about a product that I wanted. In this matter, a chrome book duet. Our phone conversation went well, and best buy confirmed that they have the product in stock at the Greenwood location. I informed the person that I am unable to pick up the product due to my illness. Best Buy suggested next day delivery. I went online and ordered the product and went along with next day shipping. The next day came, and would you believe it. I didn't receive the chrome book. So, I called 1 (888) 237-8289 call support center. They track the package, and it hasn't left the store location. I informed them that I could arrange transportation there to the store location to pick up the item at the store location. I got to the store and spoke with customer service 45 minutes later, and they replied that we could not find your order. As time passed, they finally located the order then refused to give me the order. I explained, showed them the needed information that paid. They said I would be right back with you. Twenty minutes passed, and another associate arrived. She asked, ""can I help you"" I explained the situation and gave her the information; she confirmed that it was there and paid. She relays this information to her manager, and he refused to provide me with the paid product that I ordered, and he was rude. I phoned the call center, informed them of the situation, and said they were initiating a refund. Another day passed, no package, no refund. Wow, a business trust is gone. I feel the business trust went gangster. Broken agreements, not giving you what you paid. However, if I did what they have done, I would be jailed. I failed to mention that the call center is located in Mexico, and you will find communication is another struggle due to the language barriers.",0,1
Best Buy,Faulty product refused refund,I bought a fan heater that didn't work when I tried to return the item I was told that they would look at it and insinuated that if they did not find a problem I would not receive any refund.

They preauthorized the payment on my credit card and I received a text and an email stating they were preparing my order for same day pickup. A little after 9p I get a text and email saying that the product is unavailable at that location and I need to change location, which it won’t let me. I call customer service. They can see my completed order and tell me that even though my order was processed they don’t have any inventory. Seriously?!?! They then proceed to tell me that they are sorry for the inconvenience. The inconvenience?? They over sold a product online. I asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was put on hold for 30 min, then told she was getting a Supervisor and then they hung up on me. All I can say is that I will never shop at Best Buy again!!

Do they change the product on the site to ""Sold Out"", like a normal and decent company would do? No, they change it back to ""Coming soon"" and it took hours to realize that we had missed the opportunity.

I said OK, and gave them back to him. He attempted to activate them with a hand-held device, and said there was something wrong and he had to take them back into the store. After 10 more minutes of waiting, he returned without the cards and told me his system was down, and I had to return to pick them up tomorrow???? I told him I received a message saying they were ready to be picked up, so why weren’t they already activated, he said he did not know, and I thanked him and left. On 12/11/2020 @11:00 AM I arrived back at the store, parked in pickup spot #8 and responded to the email. After about 5 minutes a different young man brought out the same 4 gift cards. I asked him if the activation had been accomplished, and he assured me they were activated at the time I purchased them. I told him about the night before, and he again assured me they were activated. I returned home to find a voice message on my home phone asking be to again return to the store because there was a problem activating the cards. I was also told that I would have to enter the store and take the cards to the service desk to be exchanged for different cards. The only reason I opted for curbside pickup was to avoid entering the store during this pandemic. For the third time, I returned to the store and went to the service desk where an employee took the cards back and replaced them with new ones that she could activate. She explained to me that gift cards had to be activated at the register, and I asked why they were sold online for curbside pickup, she stated she did not know. I then asked her if she had informed anyone of this, and she said no, she had nothing to do with the process. I will no longer patronize Best Buy; I will spend my money at retailers that can deliver what they promise.",0,1
Best Buy,Black Friday False Ads Almost Ruined Christmas!,Ordered a laptop on November 28 for delivery by December7. December 7 I was advised it was delayed. I called and spoke with three people as to whether I would get my sons most important present on time. After almost an hour and no new information I agreed to go with a comparable laptop which they were kind enough to offer me at full price! I was placed on hold yet again when I suggested it should be offered at the sale price I paid. They hung up on me. I called back and there were no notes as to my prior call. I canceled the order. I will be buying all my electronics elsewhere!,0,1
Best Buy,Buyer Beware: Deceptive sales practices,"They cancelled my order with no notice saying they didn't know when the item would be in stock and the item was in stock per their own website! Here is the story. I ordered a laptop and wireless keyboard and mouse for pick up at the Nashua, NH store as a Christmas present during the Black Friday sale, supposedly saving $250 on the laptop. A good deal if they delivered on it! I received the order confirmation email. The keyboard and mouse were available shortly afterwards, but the laptop was delayed. I decided to wait until both were ready before going to pick them up. But then I got an email saying they were going to return the keyboard and mouse if I didn't pick them up. So I did. The next day, I received an email saying they cancelled my order for the laptop saying they didn't know when it would be in stock. A few days after that I went on the website to find another laptop and the same exact one that I ordered was in stock for 1 hour pick-up! I went on-line and into the Live Chat. (Tried calling the Nashua store directly, but gave up after being on hold for over 30 minutes). I went thru 3 folks in the chat trying to get the laptop for the price I originally ordered it. Their names are Christopher F. (only initial given for last name), Eliza Davis and Mathew Wood, supervisor. When I was transfer to Mathew Wood, they locked out my ability to respond to the chat and made it look like I was not responsive to they could end the chat. I have screen shots and photos of the chat window proving all this. Bottom line: BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.",0,1
Best Buy,Buyers beware of Best Buy online. …,"Buyers beware the Best Buy conglomerate sucks! I bought a Nintendo switch game for my son for Christmas for curbside which was the only option available. They said they would text me when it was ready. I waited 8 and a half hours and nothing. I finally went in to the store and no one could find it. They said the curbside was different than the online whatever that means. After an hour in the store, they said they were sorry and offered a discount on the game that I’m sure was not even close to what he wanted. The people were nice enough, but they said it was different from the regular Best Buy. I was literally going this is Best Buy right? So 2 days later my money still wasn’t there and my husband called and they said it was being processed and it should be there in a day or 2. Here it is 6 days later and my husband is on the phone trying to get our money back. They say it could be 15 days and NO MANAGER IS THER TO TALK TO HIM. Why? It’s a debit card. You have our 65 dollars. It may not seem like much to them but it is to us. I WILL NEVER ORDER OR GO TO BEST BUY AGAIN. I GUESS WALMART WILL GET MY BUSINESS! So mad right now. Best Buy you are huge. You deal in technology yet you can’t get a simple video game off the shelf when I you said you have it! So disappointed! Buyer beware side note I very rarely give bad reviews like this so take that for what it’s worth.",0,1

Best Buy,worst customer service,"12/10/20My husband and I went into Best Buy in Elk Grove today to get a Logitech gaming pad for my brothers Christmas gift. When going upon the gaming section we see that there is none on the shelf so we decided to go ask an associate to see if they either have any in the back or if they have it at a different store. So we go to ask this one associate and we see that he is talking to what seems to be another customer to us in the appliances over where the refrigerators are, but sure enough “the customer” seems to be either a family member or family friend. Anyways when we approached the associate...1. He didn’t even have a name tag, but we knew he worked at Best Buy because he had on the uniform and 2. When asking to see if they had a product in stock, he immediately said “go find a cashier or something to help us look to see if the item is in stock because I can’t help you.” (With such a rude attitude) Wow what kind of customer service is this. So my husband and I go to find a different associate who is not wearing a name tag either nor was she even wearing her uniform, but we knew she worked there because she had a walkie talkie and she was filling an order for an online shopper. So we ask her for help and she says to us that we can go back to the gaming section and she will send an associate to come help us. So we say okay because we understand that she is busy doing her job. As we walk back we see the first associate we asked for help pushing a baby stroller following the so-called “customer” outside to I’m guessing his car because his baby was crying. So instead of helping us the first time he completely disregarded us and talked rudely to us. Anyways when waiting on yet another associate to help us, we start to look on our phones to see if anywhere else has it and it seems to be all the way out in Roseville. Now at first I didn’t want to go out to Roseville because why travel so far when possibly this Best Buy can have what we are looking for. Now 25 minutes pass and still waiting for an associate to help us and honestly there was no one really in the store and the return line wasn’t long either so I don’t know what took them so long. I finally got so tired of waiting I went to go look for an associate myself to get help. I walk over to the phone cases and I seen their supervisor (I didn’t catch his name because I was so furious) and he was nice and helpful. He looked up many of the items that I was looking for and even told me the stores that could have it and even told me some other ones that were similar to what I was looking for. As I’m talking to the supervisor I couldn’t help but notice over to my left there was another customer(female) who needed help and there were three Best Buy sales associates just talking right by her and not once asked her if she needed help and she even told the supervisor she needed help and they still didn’t help her. Maybe these Best Buy associates seem to have a problem with female customers. And maybe the first associate we approached has a problem with asians because of the way he treated us. As we were leaving we see the first associate who helped “the customer” with the crying baby walk in and then pretended to act like he was working hard because he seen his supervisor standing there. Honestly I would never go back to the “Best Buy” more like Pathetic Buy again. Horrible customer service. If I were you and you needed to go to a Best Buy I would either go to Arden or Roseville. I also hope that for the first associate who was so rude to us I hope that he either loses his job or gets a decrease in pay for his horrible customer service. For the girl I will give her credit because she was busy and she was doing her job when a customer needs help. This Best Buy in Elk Grove needs a serious upgrade and I’m not talking about the store I’m talking about the employees.",0,1
Best Buy,Deceptive Delivery Dates/No Refunds for Excessive Delays,"Like many others complaining here, I had the same delivery date issues. Upon ordering an iPad and a Microsoft Surface laptop (2 separate transactions) for my mom's birthday which is tomorrow 12/11, I was told both items will be delivered by 12/10/20. Got an email today saying there is a delay with iPad (no further delivery date provided initially), but Microsoft laptop will be delivered today. Today is 12/10 at 8pm ET and there is still no tracking # for laptop but account still says ""Arriving Today.""Called customer service and was told iPad is now arriving 12/11 but no word where laptop is (~$900 laptop). Customer service hung up on me after I asked where the laptop is. Called back and second agent refused to give me info due to ""security reasons,"" although both transactions were made through my Best Buy account. I would avoid buying anything from Best Buy- don't be fooled by the delivery dates or prices. If buying as a gift or for Xmas, please go elsewhere. Even if that means paying a little bit more for peace of mind. They won't even let me cancel the transaction because it's ""still processing."" Super deceiving.

Best Buy,Worst Customer Service Ever!!!,"Even though several people cautioned me against buying appliances from Best Buy due to their extremely bad service, I went ahead and purchased a $3500 café oven. The installation crew was unprofessional and didn’t seem to know exactly what they were doing. After a week I started smelling gas. I called customer service, but unfortunately most agents speak very poor English and I had to abandon the call multiple times to get to someone who can understand what the issue is because they kept telling me that I must contact the manufacturer for any issues. After giving up dealing with the customer service agents, I went to the store in Downers Grove, Illinois to spoke with one of the managers (Kamil), but he told me that since I did not purchase the extended support plan from Best Buy I must contact the manufacturers. I tried multiple times to explain to him that the issue is with the installation not the product, unfortunately he decided that this conversation was over and walked away. I asked him to give me the store managers name and he refused and simply said just contact our 800 customer service number again. I contacted customer service and after multiple attempts they agreed to send the installation crew one more time to check the gas leak. Unfortunately the crew came out and did a two minute check and said there is absolutely nothing wrong with the installation and it is definitely a manufacture defect with the product. I called GE and they sent the technician of which he did a very simple Test and found out that the flex pipe was not installed properly and there were bubbles visible when he sprayed liquid on the connection. I have to call Best Buy again and asked to schedule another service for them to come out and change the connections. During this two month period of back-and-forth the gas was leaking throughout my house and I had to frequently open the windows in the kitchen. This is absolutely the worst customer service ever, I strongly caution anyone from ever buying any products from Best Buy. I should have listened to the advice of my friends and bought the oven from ABT. Please think seriously before buying any appliances or items from Best Buy. Very bad customer service in the store and on the phone. Stay away!!!!",0,1

When they did come in the cabinet was a 24"" not 30"". I went to Orland Park, IL to see if they could exchange. The manager came to the return counter with an attitude. Told me it was purchased in Sept and only 14 day return. Explained to him on the situation and he says ""I'm not taking it back you will have to sell it on the street."" I was so taken back with his attitude. I told him if I knew that it was only 14 days I wouldn't of purchased it.I then went to parking lot and was on with a representative who was extremely kind. He tried to take it off my account but it wouldn't come off. He said a supervisor would be calling me. Since everyone is working from home it would be the end of the week. I waited till Friday afternoon with no one calling. I called headquarters to ask to speak to a manager after explaining the situation. I told the lady I don't want a regular guest service person. After being on hold for 45 minutes. Sure enough I got another guest service person from over seas. Said he couldn't get me to a supervisor with out explaining the situation.I ended the call only to call back head quarters where again the lady put me through a guest service person overseas.To say the least I have gotten nowhere with this situation. Since Covid I can't afford to buy a new one. I had this one up for sale with no one interested.I'm truly frustrated with Best Buy customer service and will be done purchasing anything from them again.All I wanted was an exchange not my money back.

The amount of times I was transferred on the phone between different departments just to be hung up on was absolutely insane. I even went into a local Best Buy store to try and get help but they told me it was a corporate issue. It took FOUR DAYS of me having to explain my situation to 15-20 different best buy employees total via phone call and the remote chat on their website to get this situation resolved. Of those 15-20 people, only two seemed empathetic or apologetic to my situation of having spent over $100 on a faulty product code and then receiving terrible customer service while trying to get things fixed. FINALLY, on day 4 I'm offered either a courtesy one-time refund (meaning if I need anything refunded in the future, they won't do it) or I would have to email someone else at the company to get this fixed. I chose the refund because this has been the most obnoxious and ridiculous process over something that should have been extremely simple, and I did not want to have to deal with Best Buy any longer. DO NOT purchase digital downloads on their website if you want to avoid going through the stress that I did.",0,1

Best Buy,I ordered a TV & stand to be Delivered…,I ordered a TV & stand to be Delivered together for my mother’s birthday. They called me the same day as the delivery. To tell me that they couldn’t deliver the stand that day but could deliver the tv. This was very unprofessional coming from a big company like (Bestbuy). In this case. They should have contact me before the delivery date to confirm any issues. Or let me know when I was making the purchase. That (Bestbuy) isn’t capable of delivery both items together on the same date. I canceled my order. I will never shop or Recommend (Bestbuy) ever.I thought (Bestbuy) was better than this. A more (Sophisticated) company will take over there spot very soon.,0,1

They told me they'd refund on their timeframe but assured me it would not happen within the next 48 to 72 hours... They have my money and will not cancel my order to allow me to go buy the product that I need.

It was very disappointing bc it was my grandson's first Christmas. I brought the camera back to Best Buy. I was told to send it back to Sony. Sony told me I was responsible for any damages while shipped so I had FedX pack and send it. It cost me $25 dollars. Camera came back fully charged then Easter came and again it wouldn't charge. So now it's going to cost me another $25 to ship it. Complaint #2 Recently I made a purchase at Best Buy for about $27 dollars, it was a purchase which it turned out I didn't need. I returned it about 20 days later only to be told there were no returns after 15 days. I've never, ever made a purchase where there were no returns after 15 days. If I could give Best Buy 0 stars I would. I will not be doing business with this company again.",0,1

Best Buy,I tried to give 0 stars or maybe -1…,"I tried to give 0 stars or maybe -1 would be better. You know those experiences you have with a company every once in a while (thank goodness) that actually leave you with a lasting pit in your stomach? How a company can be run so poorly and still be open, maybe not for long. My experience was with ordering a 70 inch Samsung TV on Black Friday and selecting curbside pickup. I arrived on Wednesday 12/2 at 3:30pm and followed the check in procedure as requested. The directions stated that it may take up to 10 minutes to get my purchase, rest assured we are on it. After 20 minutes you get another message saying it is taking longer than usual but the goods are on the way. They actually knew when I checked in that they were way behind and it would be a lot longer. So after 30 minutes a Best Buy employee taps on my window and I'm thinking great my TV is here...no he tells me I should go inside to get my TV since they are backed up, I mention that I picked curbside because I did not want to go in...starting to feel like a Seinfield episode. After 45 mins and seeing people that came in after me get their goods and leave I ask the BB runner where my TV is he states ""I don't know"" I ask Who does? he responds ""the computer"". Great.. After 90 minutes of waiting I finally have had enough (it actually was feeling like a war of attrition and I wanted to win) and went inside to be greeted by a well intentioned greeter who asked how I was doing. I said not to great and mentioned I had been waiting for 90 mins at curbside pickup and still did not have my TV. Was I looking for pity?...no just maybe I'm really sorry let me see if I can get you taken care of would have worked. What I got was a speech on everything that is wrong with corporate Best Buy and that everybody has been waiting...wow. If you want to get you TV you have to wait in that line. The line had 18 people in it and fed into 1 register...no thanks. So today I called customer service to either a) ship it to me or b) ship to a different store since I was not going back to that store. What I got was a) we can't ship it to you and b) we can't ship it to another store but I can cancel the order for you.....you know I really felt good cancelling the order, knowing that I did not have to go back to a Best Buy store, and believe me that is EVER!",0,1

I even paid the difference for the more expensive unit. Each and every date they gave me came and past. I have now spent 10+ hours talking to customer service reps on the phone to STILL have no resolution to this issue. I cannot use this washer/dryer and have been without one for quite some time now. All I am trying to do is have them pick this up and order a brand new, even more expensive one from them. This is absurd. Who has 10+ hours to sit and talk on the phone with their reps, be told that everything is all set, and have it turn out that nothing was ever resolved.

They said it got lost in transit, so they helped me issue a reshipment. It was suppose to arrive December 3rd, but I knew it wasn't going to because the tracking never updated from ""Getting it ready"". Morning of December 3rd, and I saw the status went to ""delayed"" so I was tired of waiting. I contacted the agents through live chat and one of them ""helped"" me issue a refund because it got ""lost in transit"". But I never got the email confirmation. An hour passed, I get an email saying that the package shipped. !! I was confused so I contacted the live chat again. I had to explain myself several times because these agents kept transferring me around and would not listen to me. I figured I was being lied to considering that the package could not be lost in transit if it never got shipped out. I was disconnected from an agent who was apparently issuing my refund. But since I got disconnected, I was transferred to another agent. Finally I had to explain it one last time before getting actual help.I finally got an email confirmation about my refund, meaning the agent that originally helped me , never did.

I about died since I just paid over $1100 on a phone. I went straight to the store and they told me there was nothing they could do since I didn't get apple care. I told them that I was under the impression that apple care only took care of software. They didn't care and said I could go over to geek squad and see if they can fix it. There was the longest line over there and my kids were being crazy so I left crying. I called corporate. Waited forever to be told that there was nothing they could do. I called again and spoke with support they said the same thing. Then I was transferred to geek squad support and they just said I can make an appointment or I can call the store or go back to the store. I called the store since I did not want to take my kids back in there. I waited on hold for over 30 minutes to be transferred to a call hub or something when the store is too busy to answer. No one helped and no one cared. I realize I declined apple care but I did so because I wasn't explained to fully what it entailed. I assumed it was just for software issues since that was what the employee told me. I feel like they should be somewhat responsible. Terrible customer service.

When I called I requested call back from supervisor (who never called) without counting that was told that can take about 5 hrs or more to call back. Today i was told that supervisor can call for complaints only for resolution.

Best Buy,BEST BUY? MORE LIKE WORST BUY!!! DON'T BUY!,"I wish there was a 0 star option so that I could give them that. I am so disgusted with ""Best Buy"". The name is ironic really since they are THE ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY EVER. They are dishonest and have no customer service whatsoever. It is a wonder that this company continues to stay in business. I placed an order at BestBuy.com for a product for an instore pickup on Nov 29 at 10:28 am. I called them around 1pm because I was concerned that they had not sent me an email saying that the order was ready for pick up and was told that the item is available but they had just not completed the order yet that was all. They then continued to lie to me every time I called; one time they said that it was on the truck, the next time they said that it was being picked from Vizio and so on. They ran me around in circles each person with a different lie only to later in the evening on 11/30 send me an email saying that the order was cancelled. When I called, They said that my order was a duplicate order which it was not. They then told me that they no longer have any of that item left. Why is Bestbuy taking orders for items they don’t have on hand to sell? What makes me even more mad is that I could have found another TV deal somewhere else but brand recognition fooled me BIGTIME!I wonder how BestBuy and companies like this stay in business? MY OPINION?.....THEY SHOULDN'T! They care nothing about the customer, they lean on their brand recognition assuming that regardless of how they treat the consumer, we will continue to patronize them.

It’s really simple. You guys sent me a freezer that was so badly dented, it won’t close. I need a new one. Best Buy has to come pick it up and deliver the new one.

Best Buy,Terrible experience,"I thought buying a dishwasher from Best Buy w/ installation would be a good experience. Unfortunately, it's been far from it. If you're thinking about doing so, I would highly recommend you look elsewhere. To put it short, I purchased 3 weeks ago and my installation has been rescheduled 4 times and I'm given no reason why. Twice I've had to take the day off from work and was literally told both times during my appointment time they would need to reschedule. This is insane. I've tried to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold for 45 minutes and then they hung up on me and didn't even try me back. I sent a message to Best Buy through Facebook about this experience and nothing. What a terrible experience.Update 12/13/20: Still no dishwasher and my 5th installation date was cancelled yet again. Oh and no matter how many times we've reached out to service we have still never been able to speak with a supervisor and they have never tried reaching out to us.. The only reason I haven't cancelled is that we were looking for the specific model we purchased.",0,1

It works great and is smooth and fast. It came with everything to just plug it in and connect it to a monitor or tv and use it. Windows 10 pro 64 bit came installed with it as well. It came with a corded mouse and corded keyboard. For what I was looking for this was a great unbeatable deal.

Delivery day comes. We wait all day (until 8 pm) for them to arrive. They never call and never arrive. Turns out the TV and parts weren’t available to be delivered and no one bothered to notify us of this. But before we were told this, multiple service agents attempted to blame the delivery failure on me by saying they didn’t deliver because we didn’t answer the phone to confirm delivery. This was a lie, we never got a phone call from Best Buy. Took more than 30 minutes to reschedule delivery, and of course the new delivery dates is weeks out. Buy elsewhere, unless you enjoy being treated like dirt. New delivery date has not yet arrived, and frankly I expect multiple failures again.",0,1

Disrespectful and heartless. Totally unprofessional! After 5hrs at BB is not cutting lines, no one has been here longer than me.

He spent nearly an hour texting with his supervisor.Finally, I got a call from someone at Installs LLC (apparently BB sub contracted) saying that I’d have to pay another $49.99 + tax.What could I do? It was 6 months!I agreed and he started doing the job.He couldn’t complete it. He said I’d need a block of wood screwed onto my door to fit the sensor properly. He said he’d notate the account and that someone would be sent to complete the job. A week went by. 2 weeks, 3 weeks. I called and of course they had no notation of any kind.They sent someone out and surprise! He didn’t have any info about the situation either.He then tells me it’s “specialty” work and it would cost another $75!He was supposed to screw in a block of wood to make it fit.He wound up just gluing on a piece of foam.The next night, I’m awakened by the alarm company at 1:50AM.They said an entry sensor had been opened.I go down, the alarm is shrieking, I’m panicked thinking I’ve got an intruder.No, the $75 specialty job fell on the floor!I’ve spent hours and hours on the phone with BB’s horrible outsourced customer service.On the rare occasion that I get the right department, they tell me that I wasn’t charged for the job.I’m looking at 2 charges on my credit card!Not to mention the $75 that the guy wanted in cash!I paid via an App so can prove it. But OMG! They won’t take any responsibility!!!$49 job is at $185! And I’ll still have to hire another company to finish the job!Hours and hours of being on hold only to get another wrong dept or to get cut off.I’ve really never seen service this bad, EVER.The worst days of Time Warner Cable did not rival the terrible service of Best Buy!Buy elsewhere and hire a 3rd party for installation.

Do I need to bring the item back to the store or just present my receipt? Her response was that they don’t do price match during Black Friday sales. Even though it was their own price, she couldn’t answer my question. I suggested that instead, I would return it and then buy it back from Amazon (who also had it on sale). Althea just disconnected. Very poor service.On the other hand, when I went to the store, all I did was present my receipt to get the difference.",0,3

Best Buy,Avoid Best Buy Business,"This review is for Best Buy Business. My rep was Jay H. I contacted Best Buy Business to help with an initial order for a store I was opening. I confided in Jay to help me pick the right equipment. I was going to get several items but of all the items I needed, only one was a better deal then what I could find online. Either way, I discussed exactly what I needed in an all in one fax machine. There were several items I discussed for this fax machine and two were not included in the machine that was sent. One was... it wasn't even a fax machine!!! No idea how he overlooked this. Actually I do. I remember he was suppose to send me an updated quote the next day. When I did not hear from him in a week a called him for an update. He completely forgot. He then proceeded to throw a quote together last minute in which I had to remind him of everything I needed. To say the least, it felt like he was not managing his client well at all. Just trying to get this done as quickly as possible. Well, I did not open the machine for over a month after purchasing as I did not need it. I was ordering in advance. So, I did not know that I was sent something that would not accommodate my business. I sent Jay two emails without a response. So, I finally just called him. He seemed caught off guard and did confirm that he had received the emails. Ok... At this point, I just wanted the issue resolved and I was willing to pay more to get what I needed. He said that it is not easy to get things approved through Best Buy and they usually do not approve refunds but could get me a credit to put towards the new one and I'll just keep the other one. He said he would get back to me by the following day. Well, once again, heard nothing and I sent three emails to get an update without any response. In the last one I literally said ""last call before I begin posting reviews."" Well, here it is. This is unacceptable and unprofessional behavior to just ignore a customer. I consider this to be an error by Best Buy and they obviously are not interested in ownership of mistakes and making it right. Very disappointed in this experience and will be avoiding this company in the future for personal and business related items.",0,1

Followed all of the instructions listed in the text message - notified the function which parking spot location I was in and began my ""We will see you in about 5 minutes!"" wait.30 minutes later, I had no TV and no patience. They were sending two staff members out VERY occasionally to deliver very small orders (I saw a lot of Nintendo Switch deliveries) and lost my patience at the 45 minute mark.I walked in to the store, waited in line at the ""in store pickup"" section - as it turns out I should have done from the beginning, and found out that the area was understaffed considerably for the amount of traffic it was getting and the store itself was in general disarray. I don't mean ""black friday is coming"" disarray, I mean the location seemed to be a locomotive off the tracks.The best part? My TV hadn't even been moved up to the pick-up, curbside delivery location. The staff member had to run to the back of the store to locate and snag my TV instead of it being moved into their delivery pen - which is something you think would happen before I got a ""Nathan, your order is ready for pick up!"" email.Management was non-existent when I wanted to speak to someone.1/10 would not recommend.",0,1

Best Buy,DO NOT BUY APPLE PRODUCTS HERE,"I am a teacher and I was funded a MacBook Pro through DonorsChoose to help supplement my virtual teaching. DonorsChoose buys all their technology through Best Buy to send to teachers. I received funding ($2500!!!!!) October 2 and was mailed my MacBook immediately— it arrived October 8. When I set up the entire computer, I quickly discovered that the battery needed to be replaced and the computer shut down immediately when unplugged. I mailed back the MacBook— and received a replacement November 18 (yes, over a month later). I set up the MacBook replacement November 19 and guess what, I was sent yet ANOTHER MacBook that doesn’t hold a charge and needs the battery replaced. For $2,500, you would think I would have received a brand new computer, right? WRONG. I plugged the serial number into Apple and found that the replacement I was sent was a 2019 MacBook— with a faulty battery. I am not convinced that Best Buy didn’t send me two refurbished MacBooks. Why would they send me a 2019 MacBook for $2500? They won’t answer my emails either. Terrible TERRIBLE customer service and experience overall. I am just a teacher trying to give my students a better experience with virtual learning. SO disappointing.",0,1

Best Buy,Just terrible and useless customer support,"I spent countless hours talking (and chatting) with customer support (outsourced to India, apparently) because there was a glitch in their system which kept cancelling my order automatically after I placed it because it thought I was trying to buy more than 1 of the same product.Three times, after calling, the agent told me I was going to be transferred to the sales department. Even though I explicitly said that previous agents transferred me to Best Buy Business by accident, I kept being transferred to Business (which would tell me that was the wrong department).I tried to place the same order under different names and cards to avoid being caught in the glitch, as suggested by one of the agents in the chat. When I am talking with a different agent on the phone, next day, he literally said: ""I don't want to be pointing fingers here, but you should have contacted us instead of keep placing orders by yourself""...There were many more problems every time I called customer service, but they are boring to enumerate here. All in all, terrible service, I ended up selecting the Spanish version of the call, to avoid agents from a call center in India. This person was more helpful (instead of ""pointing fingers""), but he couldn't solve my problem either. I ended up giving up. So many hours of my live that I won't get back were wasted talking to them. If possible, avoid doing anything that will eventually require contacting customer service. Best Buy is really dropping the ball here and relying in poorly trained outsourced call centers.",0,1
Best Buy,Horrible Experience,"I had been eyeing getting a large premium TV for quite a while. I was waiting until a good sale came up and today the XBR85X900H dropped to $1969.99 and I thought now was the time to buy. My plan was to get a best buy credit card and take advantage of the rewards and 0% financing for 24 months. Well I applied for a credit card and got a $1,000 limit... This is unacceptable as my FICO is over 800, I have very close to zero debt, no hard inquiries, lots of disposable income, etc... I called and they said I could ask for an increase, so I did and it was denied. So now I am stuck with a new account and a hard inquiry on my credit report because they won't cancel the inquiry even though I do not want the card, it's useless to me. Supposedly I'll find out in 7-10 days why, which I am extremely curious to find out. Anyways, horrible experience and they are not willing to help in any way. So I will avoid Best Buy like the plague from now on and I will make sure to share my experience with as many as I can.",0,1

However they only had ONE kind of strap IN ONE SIZE with the demo watches. There is a display full of differnet bands and types. I asked to try one on and they looked at me like I had 4 heads. ""We cant do that, you have to buy it"". So iam am like ""how do I know how it fits and if the color and style of band look ok?"". ""Well sir you have to buy it and if it does not fit you need to return it"". A $450 dollar watch you are not allowed to try on the bands. Also found out they dont even carry any of the new bands and told me if ""I wanted to try one on I would need to go to apple"". I do agree, I never should have gone to BESTBUY in the first place.If you want an APPLE WATCH, DO NOT GO TO BESTBUY.

I called the bank and told them that it was ok to release the money because I had made a purchase. The next day I called Best Buy customer service to update the information. The agent told me that I didn’t need to update the information everything was ok. The following week I check to see when the order was being delivered and that’s when I realized that my order was canceled. I called customer service and they told me that there was error on my shipment information and they couldn’t full fill my order. They promised that they will order the ps5 when it released the next week. When the agent call me she dropped the phone call and called me back following that evening saying that she couldn’t do anything.

Best Buy,Best Buy's shipping company stole my PS5,"Best Buy contracted a local shipping company, Lone Star Overnight to deliver my PS5. The PS5 has been ""lost"" in their warehouse since Saturday. Best Buy support has refused to help me every step of the way. I have been chasing the shipping company to try and ""find"" my console in their warehouse. The kicker, they never even attempted to make a delivery! Between the 30+ phone calls, chats, and tweets to both companies, I finally was able to speak with a customer support manager at Best Buy. They refused to work with me to send me a new console or supply me with a store to pick up from. They stated all they can do is begin a refund process to investigate the shipping company. And I can once again be thrown into the cycle of attempting to find a console due to their failures.Best Buy has held my money for over three months now, has not refunded anything, and has not given me anything to compensate for the countless hours I've spent trying to chase their contracted shipping company that clearly stole my product. I would be extremely cautious ordering this product from Best Buy, if there is any issue with the delivery they will not help you. They will do literally nothing in the way of support or fulfillment of your purchase. From what I understand from my friends that preorder the console after me and have received from other companies, it's great. I would just strongly advise against using Best Buy even if it is the only place that has preorders available.",0,1

No answer. I then told her I was willing to wait for the item to be restocked but I wanted the same price. All she kept repeating after that was that she would process a refund. I asked if an order was cancelled before the good was shipped how could the credit card be charged? She did not answer. Instead she transferred me to some one else. This person could not give me a reason why the order was cancelled and was of no help. She wanted to transfer me to someone else.

When the job was switched, the phone stayed with the place of employment. Problem is, we didn't unpair the watch before returning the phone. The phone was cleared of our info, including the Apple Watch app. We no longer have access to the email used when setting up the watch. Typically, this wouldn't be an issue because we'd be able to unlock the watch with the original receipt. Problem is, BestBuy does not document the serial number of the apple product being bought online from them. It is no where on the receipt. We've sent proof of purchase, but because it's not documented on there, apple refused to unlock it for us. Another lesson learned is always keep the original box it came in. Maybe that would've helped? Best Buy directs me to apple, and apple directs me back to Best Buy. They've both been useless. What makes matters worse is that I even bought AppleCare with the product.",0,1

Best Buy,No Consideration for Long Term Customers,"This review is more about loyalty and good customer service than anything else after being charged a 100+% promotional interest penalty.I made a mistake, and had a promotional purchase being paid on a monthly ""auto pay"" from my bank. I didn't pay attention to my monthly statements, because I knew it was being paid every month ( early every month ). When I did look at recent statements, I noticed a problem. When I went back a few months, I saw where I received a $457 interest charge on a $422 remaining balance. I immediately called when I found the problem , and was told since a few months had passed there was nothing they could do now. I told them I would have paid the $422 if I would have known to avoid a 110+% interest charge. I asked if they could split it or do anything as I have been a customer for 20+ years and literally have spent in excess of $20k. The answer from Best Buy customer service & her supervisor for that type of loyalty is ""I am sorry - Nothing we can do"".I've learned my expensive lesson here, and will spend my money with a company that appreciates the customer.

Absolutely no empathy for the situation. Apparently you only have 14 days to return an unopened item bought. I will continue to tell this story to everyone, it’s outrageous. I had no choice but to take store credit. Because I “missed their “holiday extended return policy” by a few days. I was just shocked by the greedy position the store took. I’ve shopping there for years and fortunetly never had to return something before. As the employees confirmed the item was fine, but kept hanging there hat on “14 day” return policy.

I purchased a full suite of kitchen appliances in August where they were very happy to take my money and was told I would get a call in mid October to set up delivery. Needless to say this phone call never came, I called at the end of October and was told the only item in stock was the refrigerator so I made delivery and installation arrangements for the next week and the remaining 3 appliances set for deliver in mid November. On the day of delivery the delivery men arrived opened up all the doors to the house, measured the pathway to the refridge I asked them to put something down to protect my hardwood floors and the deliver man walked out and drove away, not delivering. Best Buy’s customer service agents were totally incompetent, unable to provide an explanation only able to reschedule the delivery, that’s all their computer would allow them to do. On delivery 2 date in mid November the second attempt at the refrigerator, after removing my exiting refrigerator and throwing it on their truck they open the new one and it was severely damaged.

I was told the built-in battery has stopped working and I also noticed a spark on the battery cable. at that time I thought it was a great deal to buy it for approximately 350USD .... it costs about 150usd to buy and new built-in battery and cable from where I am and fix it. I realized CHEAP IS EXPENSIVE.,0,1

I would not gripe about it but being that this item was a xbox series x s console that was for my kids. I really thought that the funds would be taken out and transaction would be complete. After checking my bank account after a couple of days I noticed that I had extra money after investigating a little further it was the amount they put on hold. So I called the store in Yuma and asked an associate how it works he had said that when I pick the item up, that’s when I would be charged. Had he told me that they would verify fund again I would of known that I had to keep that amount there for when they feel like it. If it was pre ordered and my card did not go through they should of gave me an option when I got there to either pay cash or run the card again. I’m sure it is still getting shipped to the store regardless anyways. I am pissed, poor policy. Don’t be fooled.",0,1

Best Buy,I bought an LG washer and dryer that…,"I bought an LG washer and dryer that had to be stacked. When the installers got to my home, the one who appeared to be the authority marches into my basement to my laundry room and declares “ It won’t fit!” I measured it several times myself and it would fit. He just wanted to argue with me that it wouldn’t fit. Now, I sold appliances for 40 years so I’m not stupid on the measuring thing. My opinion was he was lazy. He refused to install even after we got the tape measure and showed him it would fit. Finally I told him to get out of my house. After some discussion with my husband we decided to just have them leave the washer and dryer and we would get the son in law to stack them. We went out to the truck and told them to leave them. The stupid delivery kid says “No, they’re going back to the store.” I then called him an a$$. When I called Best Buy they basically refused to do anything because I had an “altercation” with the delivery kid. Basically, calling the delivery man exactly what he was is considered an altercation by Best Buy. So, I demanded my money back and bought an LG washer dryer pair from Big Sandy and they came right out and had it installed and stacked in 15 minutes. I’ve spent a lot of money with Best Buy but NO more!",0,1

Best Buy,Buyer beware,"Without a doubt, my recent experience with Best Buy is enough for me to close my account with them and never spend a penny at their stores. Purchased a 65"" tv online which after I installed it we discovered a problem. Geek squad was to come out but first an ordered part would arrive at my home. When I called Best Buy the day prior to my appointment to tell them the required part did not arrive I was told the part was never ordered. I demanded they replace the current tv, they did. Problem is replacement had a different issue and I would need a week before someone could come out to fix the unit. I asked to speak with a supervisor, was told I would receive a call back, never did. The 2nd tv is going back, I've requested a refund and once my refund is received I'm closing my account with them . Just a few words to the wise",0,1

Best Buy,Today was my very first experience with…,"Today was my very first experience with best buy online. I ordered a car stereo with installation at 8:23 this morning. My installation was for 12:30. As I was walking in the door I received an email that my item was not available, after driving an hour. The guy at the counter apologized and said I could pick out another one that they could still do the installation which, I did. It was out of stock. The third one I picked out was out of stock as well. After finding a more expensive one that was in stock, an hour and a half later they were going to knock fifty dollars off for the inconvenience. The guy that helped me on the floor took the stereo to the guy at the counter who said let me touch base with geek squad. He finally returned with a lady who said that she didn't have a 12:30 appointment, that I was not on her board. I showed her the appointment email and she asked what type of car I had. I told her and she said ""oh, those take a while, I could probably do it Tuesday"". This is where I finally become an unsatisfied customer because I wasted four hours of my day and have nothing to show for it. I called your ""corporate"" office and I was transferred and disconnected numerous times. I have explained my experience more than I would care to and still haven't received an explanation. As a business owner I am usually more understanding than most because things happen. What really upsets me is the fact that i wasted valuable time for nothing and nothing to show for it.

Since time was important to me I contacted Best Buy asking to cancel the order. Of course I did not expect any issues, was not my fault after all. And what did I hear? That the order can't be canceled and I will need to wait until(if) it gets delivered and send it back. Of course I won't see my money until that happens. And I heard the same from the supervisor I wanted to speak with. I lost over half an hour and did not get my issue resolved (nor even understood).

Best Buy,Best buy has continuously let me down,Best buy has continuously let me down. This delivery was scheduled originally on October 18 and guaranteed for October 28. Since this state I have been lied to rescheduled and lied to some more. As of today they are not going to deliver at all. Because their 3rd party installer has lost their license and cannot do the install. Apparently they will be rescheduling at some indefinite date in the future and they have absolutely no intention of doing anything until that indefinite date.

Best Buy,Ran my best buy card without authorization,"On June 21st I made a purchase that requires a install. I had to pay first before they scheduled a install date, no problem. I paid with my personal credit card thru a text that best buy sent me which was no problem. A few weeks later I received a billing statement from best buy stating I owed for the install. Ridiculous I was billed twice. It gets better then I disputed the charge they required documentation so I sent them everything they requested. They kept sending me monthly billing statements saying it was in dispute status but keep charging me interest,how's that??? After 4 months they finally credited back my account and they promised me it wouldn't get reported to the credit bureau due to a dispute, guess what they reported it and it dropped my score 102 points. Now I have to spend more time calling the credit bureaus to see if it's been removed. I've had a best buy card for almost 10 years I'm canceling the card and I'd rather pay interest versus dealing with this nonsense again! I will never make another purchase with them again.

I asked to refund and said that they were using customers money with free of charge for their investment. Told them I will share this to media. I saved original order received email in other file before I called them. The 1st guy told me he would send 10% compensation gift 20 minutes later. But I didn't receive any refund or compensation. I looked for another washer available in Nov from their website and decided to get 4.8 cu ft Maytag. I called back to exchange and apply 10% compensation to this order and refund the rest. This time, the 2nd customer service guy told me he wouldn't apply 10% to 2nd order. He asked me to hold while talking to his supervisor. But asked me to order smaller washer. He called refund Department and told me email was just sent. Then he told me he can transfer me to his supervisor and I got voice mail that doesn't accept messages because it was full.First, Bestbuy lied taking customers prepaid money from preorders without guaranteed delivery promised date. Second, their customer service people lie that they didn't realily pay compensation, 3rd their IT stole back their order received email on the day after I 1st talked to customer service.

He ask me to be patient and wait until 3:00 for that manager to call. At 5:00pm I was calling customer service again. This time I talked to an arrogant person. He told me there was nothing I could do and that I would have to wait 24 hours and I could reschedule. But by now all I wanted is to get my money back. So he told me to wait 24 hours and I could get my money back. So Sunday we went to Best Buy in Temple.

Best Buy,DO NOT PURCHASE AT Best Buy,"DO NOT PURCHASE AT Best Buy! I bought a laptop in August 2020 and also purchase a ""support insurance"" for $150.00. I was told that the laptop and any future electronics will be covered under the insurance. A few weeks after I purchased a Samsung 4K 65"" Tv Series 7. On November 1 the Tv stopped working. I mean...DEAD! Called Best Buy and they transfer me to Samsung Support. After 45 min. attempting everything I was advised that it seems there is something wrong with the Tv and to schedule a repair appt. so they can come and fix it. I called Best Buy again and asked why I was referred to Samsung to fix the problem if I paid $150 for support insurance. Come to find out the support insurance is good for one year. Best Buy for the first year refers the customer to the manufacture to solve the problem (KEEP IN MIND YOU ALREADY HAVE 1 YEAR WARRANTY WITH THE MANUFACTURE) and after a year you have to re-new the support insurance again with Best Buy to fix the problem with your device because the manufacture warranty already ran out. So in a few words, Best Buy steals $150.00 from you when you purchase your electronics for ""Support Insurance to end up having the manufacture take care of the problem for them. I went to the store and I demanded my money back for the Support Insurance that eventually I was never going to receive the service I paid for in the first place.

When I booked the appointment, no one told me to bring the cable, and besides, you're Best Buy. I spend a fair amount of money annually for your services.Around 4:30 this afternoon, Best Buy called me to ask me to bring the charging cable -- again.Let's review: I dropped off my laptop at 11:40 this morning. Your company called me at 4:30. In all that time, you couldn't find a charging cable, and Best Buy is supposedly the leading consumer IT support company.When I see my doctor for a cold, I'm not expected to bring tissues, Nyquil and cough drops to my appointment. If you want to keep Best Buy in your name and expect that those words reflect your level of service, then you've got some work to do.",0,2

He literally took the sticker off of the laptop while I was standing there! It was $100 cheaper than the first one he brought out. He just lost a sale. Not sure if I would have gotten that particular laptop but I lost all interest in looking at that point. I left immediately.",0,1
Best Buy,"A NEW Refrigerator was to be Delivered, NOT!","A NEW Refrigerator was to be delivered. When the delivery people get here they state its not new, it already open, we have no idea if its in working order - you want to accept to not. This is replacing a refrigerator that is not working well right now! So let us call Best Buy and see what they say - 4 mins later delivery guy says we called and told them, so we're leaving - I state I'm still trying to get thru to someone - they leave and I'm stating you represent Best Buy you need to stay while we're trying to get this figured out. No we have to leave - so I screamed some choice words at them and then finally got through to someone with Best Buy. Nothing we can do - we can't tell you anything until its taken out of the delivery que. Let us speak with a supervisor/manager and are told the manager said no. We continue to persist and are told after 28 mins a supervisor will contact you w/in the hour. They have 20 minutes to call from right now! Unacceptable to be sent a refrigerator that is not BRAND NEW and for the loaders of the truck to not read what was supposed to be getting delivered and basically not care - not their problem.",0,1

So I rescheduled, and this time I picked from 12 pm to 6 pm for the next day, and once again No show! I went online and chatted with one of their agent concerning my order and all they can say is they are going to check and not to worry it will be delivered today 10/23/20, so I wait for it for the delivery man and still no show! I must have called at least 3 times and want online 2 times. This is ridiculous! I finally called for the last time and the agent said the next delivery will be on Monday 10/26/20, infuriated! They confused my daughter's name on the shipping instead of my name OMG! My daughter was so upset she screamed at the agent and said I want my refund now! I told the agent the same!

Again, over two weeks later, a customer service representative tells me that my PARTIAL refund was just processed YESTERDAY and should be received in 15 business days. I was then told that I had to speak to another department about getting the other portion of my refund back, despite this being a SINGLE purchase. Each time I call to follow up, I am given conflicting information and no representative can reference information provided during my preceding call.

Best Buy,What a horrible experience,"My husband and I bought a gas range from Best Buy in Danvers, MA. That process seemed fine. We schedule delivery for 4 days later or so. The installers come in and say that they can't install it because it is too close to our wood cabinets and illegal and we need a 6 inch gap. NO ONE HAS THAT GAP. We were also not told about that requirement. We have them take the new range so we do not have two ranges sitting in our kitchen. We put out a request on Home Advisor and someone gets in touch saying that Best Buy just never wants to do work so he will install it for us. Great, cool, we schedule the range to be dropped off again. Also a part of their ""service"" is that they are supposed to haul our old one away. So we were just going to have them drop off the new one and haul the old one away. They get here the following week to do so, come in, and say they can't take it because our gas line is still connected. THEY NEVER TOLD US WE HAD TO DISCONNECT OUR OWN GAS! WHAT KIND OF SERVICES DO THEY ACTUALLY DO THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT US TO DO?? My husband calls the Danvers, MA store where we got it from looking for compensation. They say that cooperate deals with compensation. My husband calls cooperate and they say that the stores deal with compensation of in-store purchases. I call the Danvers, MA store, am put on hold, and based off the past week where my husband was trying to deal with the original fiasco of them not being able to install it and being put on hold for 20 minutes and disconnected several times, I decided to see if I would be connected to someone first or arrive at the store in person. Sure enough 20 minutes later, I arrived at the store and was still on hold. I go into the store, am directed to customer service, directed to appliances, give the guy my story, and he calls cooperate because he was confused why cooperate directed us back to the store for compensation. He talks to someone for a while, hands the phone to me, and I tell this other guy my experience. The guy on the phone then tells me... Well here are the notes the installers left verbatim... and he then read off to me what the installers wrote about how they couldn't install the stove because it was illegal. I told him my argument about how that 6 inch requirement wasn't told to us and how they came back and then would not take the old oven because we did not disconnect the gas- which we were, again, not told. He then said to me... Well you never disclosed the set up of your house. We don't know that information. So I'm sorry I don't understand how you expect to be compensated and you're not going to be. The miscommunication; the customer service; the lack of services- it all kills me. I see no reason for why we would think to be like... by the way, we have wooden cabinets. Is that going to be a problem? That is more of a professional/expert thing to inquire about, not a homeowner thing to know to provide. I could not advise more to not ever use Best Buy!!",0,1

My computer had an error message after so off to the repair shop it went. Three weeks later, I get it back. The result? They unplugged the new HDD and problem solved! No more error message! I took it back and explained the reason I brought in in was for them to fix the error, not unplug it and call it a day! So another 3 weeks goes by and they tried to tell me I need a new motherboard. I told them to just give me back my computer. I took it to a reputable place, who informed me the problem was that the HDD was not compatible with my model of computer. So it wasn't a motherboard issue after all. Say what? I demanded a refund on the HDD but nope, due to their negligence of properly diagnosing my computer issue and keeping it in their repair shop for 2 months, it was past the return date. Waste of money and time. I was planning on buying a new Macbook there but I'm going to take my business elsewhere.",0,1

Best Buy,Replacement parts should last more than 1 year,"On July 4, 2018 my husband and I purchased a SONY bravia 60"" LCDtv. I believe we also purchased a protection plan for the tv at this time. Always well until about August 2019. The picture would not turn on, and we would see a series of blinking lights.We called Best Buy and were told it was a ""bad board"". Geek Squad came to our house and replaced the board. The TV worked well after that.Last week, we began to encounter the same problem with the TV not having a picture. My husband called, explained the situation, and set up an appointment for someone to come fix it.On Wednesday, October 7, my husband received a phone call stating that no one would be able to come to our house because any tv under 43"" must be brought into the store. My husband let the person know that our tv was 60"", and therefore someone should be able to come out. He was unsure of the outcome when he hung up, and he was at work so he was unable to call back.On Saturday, 10/10, I called to see if we were still covered under the protection plan. I was told we were no longer covered, and would be charged for the visit. In addition, the person on the phone stated that we were scheduled for an INSTALLATION of a tv. Someone was coming here to hang my tv on my wall. At this point I had been transferred about 3 times, and had to explain my situation each time. Does no one communicate when they transfer a call? I was extremely frustrated and told the person to cancel my appointment, because it would have been useless anyway.On Tuesday 10/13, I called again to start fresh and see what kind of help we were eligible for. Again, I was transferred multiple times, and after a 40 minute call, I was told nothing can be done unless I purchase the total tech plan for $199, then pay $49 for someone to come and diagnose the issue, and then pay for any parts the tv may need. At this point we are looking at the same price I could pay for a new television. When I asked the person how it was that if we didn't have a plan, that my husband was able to set up an initial repair appointment, she was unable to give me an answer.We were never notified that our protection plan was expiring, nor were we offered an opportunity to extend the plan. I am very displeased with the service we have received, and I will be closing my account with Best Buy.",0,2
Best Buy,Horrible service experience(s) at Buckhead Atlanta and online,"July, 2020, bought a NetGear WiFi extender (750) for $49.99. The coverage wasn’t strong enough, so a week later I returned it for one with a wider range (2000) for $99.00. As it turns out, even the 2000 sq ft coverage was spotty, often requiring us the re-connect or relaunch in order to have a connection, which is unacceptable. Yesterday (October 17, 2020) I attempted to return the 2000 sq ft extender for a 10,000 sq ft ($149.99) extender. The greeter was friendly, the floor sales person was friendly. When I got to the register, receipts and return product in hand, the cashier said “I need to get a manager”. Hope came over and said “this is outside the 15 return window, there’s nothing I can do. I can neither return nor exchange this product. Have a nice day”. I said “what do you mean... you see the history that I’ve only returned to get a stronger, more expensive product. The 2000 sq ft is in its original box, I just need s stronger one.” I further said “look at my purchasing history... I’ve bought computers, televisions and accessories from Best Buy. I’ve even had a Geek Squad contract for over 10 years. You’re just gonna let me walk out of here of a $50 PROFIT because my return is over 15 days”. Her response: “there’s nothing more I can do. Have a nice day”.I came home and dialed the 888-BESTBUY number. Guess what? There is NO option for customer service. I pressed “2” and after 3 rounds of pressing “0”, i was defaulted to another option where I was finally able to get through to “Mark”. Mark kept me on hold forever while he tried to resolve my issue. In the meantime, I’d accessed the Best Buy website and was concurrently reading the return policies. When Mark finally did return to the line, he read me the policy from the website and told me that there was nothing more he could do, that the store manager had the final say.” I asked for a service supervisor and he told me that it would be a long hold, but that he’d try to find one. I held for 40 minutes before I began an online chat with Vincent V. Vincent told me that supervisors were very busy... that they had a lot of meetings and that I’d probably be on hold with Mark for a very long time.Over the years, I’ve spent thousands and thousands of dollars with Best Buy, and this manager, Hope, at the Buckhead Atlanta location had no better sense than to walk a customer out the door over an exchange where she and BB would’ve benefitted. Never again... they’ve gotten my last dollar.",0,1
Best Buy,Failure of  Reasonable Warranty Service,"Feb 2019, I purchased a LG microwave together with a 5 year service warranty. On Sept 11,2020 the microwave stopped working. Today is Oct 18, 2020.

Best Buy,Poor Procedures on their end,"Poor Procedures on their end. Do not use BestBuy.com to make big purchases that require delivery. Do not bother with receiving empty text messages. Technology cannot replace going into store and making transactions with live sales associates. Finally saved the cash to get first choice refrigerator to replace 20 +yr old that came with house. Ordered Maytag Refrigerator on-line on Sept. 1st and contacted bank to allow such a big purchase to process due to fraud protection on checking account. Despite getting numerous texts and emails from Bestbuy.com confirming/reminding me of my delivery date I received a text at 4:57 pm ON DAY BEFORE scheduled delivery saying I needed to confirm my payment method. Purchase amount had sat in my account for almost 45 days and would not process as fraud protection waiver had expired but it was now 5:00 pm and no way to call my bank to have them allow the purchase. No one answers phone at local store to advise me on this. Visiting the link provided in all the texts received only sent me to a waiting period on the phone to a customer service phone number. I was met by an unsympathetic agent who asked for an alternative form of payment and I explained I was not comfortable with paying for an item with a credit card when I had the funds sitting in the bank and needed to only call them in morning for payment to go though. She then informed me that since my payment had been denied MY ORDER HAD BEEN RE-ROUTED and was now on back order and I would need to re-order the Maytag for a December delivery date!!!!! Stomped to local store where I was met by a very helpful and sympathetic associate who tried to make sense of what he could see on his end and he too was baffled why they would even try to process payment so late. It appeared the model I ordered was on back order and despite the NUMEROUS text confirmations of delivery, they were most likely going to advise me of need to re-schedule delivery 2.5 months from now. So do not take a day off work, do not pay to have your kids/dogs sent to a sitter to keep them out of way of delivery/installation crew, DO NOT clean out your refrigerator and have it considerately waiting to be hauled away (also purchased along with water line that they did charge me for at time of order) I have a feeling that if I had gone into store and ordered this item , I would have the new refrigerator of choice sitting in my kitchen and never found the CEO email from June. I will find one elsewhere and wait for my first choice, American made model,and not the junk LG and Samsung models that are breaking down and un-repairable within a year. Oh yeah, after searching through all of my emails about my purchase, I found a very opinionated email from CEO about perceived race relations in our country. I do not need to know opinions of celebrities, corporations, and slanted news media but since they throw it out there, I can chose to not support their one-sided views with my money.",0,1

Chatted with Sage at 2:17pm , then Genelia and Peter, finally ending the chat at 3:05 pm - around 40 minutes wasted!. The response - they'll call when the truck arrives at my location. IT WAS A LIE! I waited the rest of the day and no communication until finally after 8pm, I get a generic instruction to schedule an appointment. Never mind that I waited all day and they claimed MULTIPLE times that the TV was on the delivery truck which never showed up.Worse yet, when I click through to try to reschedule, I get the following message: ""We're sorry, something went wrong on our end. Please try again in a few minutes."" I try again and again and again and ... SAME RESULT.Looks like it is standard operating practice for Best Buy, but to me, waiting all day for a delivery is a big waste of time. I had a friend available to help me install the TV, but he had to go to work. Under state law, I can sue in small claims court, but is it really worth it.As an aside, Best Buy previously blocked my rewards account even though I had unspent rewards. I have spent over $10k at Best Buy over the years, but am much less likely to purchase from them in the future.This is NOT the way to run a business. Next time, I'll purchase somewhere else - Best Buy is not worth the aggravation.UPDATE: Rescheduled for October 19, 2020. We waited for the delivery. Nothing came, no one came to our front door. At 12:39, received an email receipt - ""Service Completed: 10/19/2020"" Called up the customer service number ""Below is a record of your order. If you have any questions or would like to schedule another appointment, please call 800-GEEKSQUAD (800-433-5778)."" Called them up - claimed no one was home, but we were. Later checked my voicemail which said they were at my address, but did not have the correct gate code. But, while we do have a gate at the front of our driveway, it is manual and has been tied open for over a decade. This is ridiculous. Wanted to reschedule - they refuse to do that. Ask to speak to a manager/supervisor - similarly refused - told that the supervisor is only available via email.At this point, Best Buy/Geek Squad/Pilot Freight (apparently Best Buy's subcontractor) have missed two appointments and now refuse to reschedule without me waiting 24 - 48 hours for the system to be updated. Hopefully I can get my TV by Halloween, but I'm not holding my breath. Lesson hopefully learned - don't buy from Best Buy!",0,1

Best Buy,"We're people, not cattle.","We recently purchased some new appliances from Best Buy and were happy with the sales person and his attentiveness. However - the revised covid policies recently put into place are completely overboard, unnecessary and asinine in their scope and implementation.We're people, not cattle. When the store has barely anyone in it and the advanced restrictions have already been lifted - the last thing you should be doing is escorting people along from barrier to barrier, sticker to sticker and march us along like we're prisoners. You open the doors, let people in and let them go to where they need. This policy was not in place even when the state demands on stores were stricter - why this militaristic marching around like we're being forced through a cattle-chute was implemented after restrictions were lessened is outrageous. Not one single other chain we visited for appliances treated people in such a disrespectful manner. I had visited the same location with my son less than two months earlier, and outside of being forced to wear a mask the store experience was as pleasant and normal as it had always been. What is being done to customers now isn't just unnecessary - it's just unconscionably bad business. Whoever in corporate decided your revised approach should be fired. It is overboard and beyond anything we are experiencing at other stores we shop at - and it will be a cold day in Hades before I subject my family to such dehumanizing treatment again.",0,2

When I got home I transferred everything from my old phone and erased everything so it could be recycled. I searched for cell phone recycling and saw that Best Buy offers that service. I tried calling my local store and sat on hold for 20 minutes with no one answering the phone. I hung up and called their 800 customer service number and when I finally got a live person, I had trouble understanding her because English was not her first language. I told her that I saw on their website that they recycle cell phones at their stores and asked if they were currently offering that service because of the COVID pandemic. She said she didn't know; I would have to ask the store itself. I told her that I had just waited for 20 minutes on the local store's phone and no one answered. She then said that I could check their website or drive to the store and check with them. I said, ""Thanks for nothing!"" and hung up.",0,1

Best Buy,Bestbuy Nightmare,"My recent experience with Bestbuy was the worst Ive ever had with any retailer. On 9/15/20 I purchased an iPhone through a rep over the phone. It was supposed to be in on the 17th. It didn't arrive, my delivery date kept changing, and there was no updates to the tracking details. On the 18th I phoned the shipper, UPS, and was informed that they had not received the product from Bestbuy. I then called Bestbuy. During this conversation I felt like the reo was just trying to get me off the phone. He told me to wait until 22nd, didn't try to look into the phones whereabouts, or reorder the phone ( which was still showing in stock online at that time). I also had to ask him 3 times to verify that Ups did not have the phone, before he would answer the question. The phone of course didn't come in on the 22nd, the shipping details still had not changed, and it was now out of stock online. I called Bestbuy again on the 23rd, preceded to spend over 3 hours on the phone, repeated myself to at least 14 different people, was disconnected numerous times as well as transferred more than once to the wrong department. One rep, Carly finally created a claim for me and made notes on my account. Her manager also offered me a 10% discount on my next purchase (which at that point I didn't think was enough considering all of my trouble). She then transferred me to another department to refund the phone and cancel the billing contract through my carrier. It wasnt the right department however, and I was again transferred between numerous people, one of which told me that I would be contacted within 72hrs about my claim. When the call was again disconnected at around 3 1/2 hour in(I had 5 bars at the time so I think it was on their end), I finally gave up and decided to wait the 72hrs to be contacted in case the phone was found. On the 28th, after not being contacted back for 5 days, I tried calling again but was disconnected after 45 minutes and didn't have time to call again until the next day. On the 29th, I again spent over 3 hours on the phone. I was sent to numerous departments, none of whom could figure out how to refund the phone or cancel my contract. I was even sent to apple care twice, who have nothing to do with missing orders or contract cancellation. They also couldn't transfer me back to Bestbuy, so I had to start over again both times. At one point I spoke with a rep I could barely understand, who couldn't find my order # that 6 previous employees had been able to pull up, locate the notes on the account, and refused to look up the claim #. She finally found my tracking details and started to argue with me about needing to wait for the shipment to be delivered, at which point I asked her if she'd understood me when I had told her that Ups didn't have the order and there hadn't been any progress since the 16th. She then put me on hold with no warning and never picked back up. I hung up after 7 minutes and called back. Eventually I spoke with an employee who said that the claim was sent to the wrong department originally and he had to create a new one. Half way through our conversation, before he had a chance to transfer me for the refund, his headset went to static, I waited 8 minutes until the went dead. It had again been nearly 3 1/2 hour again, and I couldn't spend any more time on the phone that day. I was trying to deal with all of this while moving and also caring for my severely autistic son. He gets agitated when I'm on the phone, and had a meltdown both days. At that point I was worried about even getting a refund, let alone any kind of future discount. I thought I would have to go through my bank for a charge back. I emailed customer service, posted to their blog and finally escalated the issue to the BBB. It took several more days to hear anything back, at which point I received an email from them that stated someone would contact me soon. I got a call on the 7th, the rep said he'd called several times to get a hold of me. I literally had 4 calls from him within a ten minute period, and no messages, so it wasn't as if he'd tried to reach me for days, just minutes. I hadn't answered initially because I was busy with my son. I had to stop what we were doing to answer since I kept getting calls. He took information from me and said he'd call the next day. I didn't get a call until the 9th, though there had been an email on the 8th indicating my refund had been processed. They said they'd contacted my carrier about the contract as well, but that was either a lie or they didn't explain the situation properly. I had to contact my phone carrier to make a claim with them, as they had no notes from Bestbuy. After all of that, all I was offered was a free phone case with my next phone purchase, which is a complete joke. Especially since I'll never purchase from Bestbuy again. I certainly wouldn't recommend them to anyone. This has been a nightmare.",0,1

Best Buy,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"I purchased 3 appliances on 12 SEP 2020. One was on backorder. Scheduled delivery and installation for the other two appliances for 24 SEP 2020. Items were delivered on the 24th as scheduled. One of the items was badly damaged and I refused to accept it. The other item was fine so I accepted it. The installer was unable to remove the appliance being replaced and was unable to install the new one. I called a professional out who removed the appliance the following morning and rescheduled my installation (since I already paid for it) with Best Buy for the 28th of September. The 28th arrives but my appliances do not. After my appointment window had passed, I contacted the store to check on status. I was told my appointment had been rescheduled because the other appliance I refused to accept was now available and they preferred to deliver and install them at the same time. I was frustrated but accepted a new delivery/installation date of 02 OCT 2020. That day comes and goes, my appliances are not delivered. I contact the store. They tell me the appliance that was to be delivered is on back order so they cancelled the appointment (without notifying me). They rescheduled the appointment for 08 OCT 2020. My appointment window passes, I contact the store - I am again told the appointment had been rescheduled without notification to me. By this point I had already take off three days of work in order to be home for the delivery. Now they're telling me that they can't get me scheduled until October 23rd and that's just for delivery of the missing item - installation can't be performed until November. I had paid for the elite preferred plan which was supposed to provide guaranteed delivery - what a rip off that was. The store manager, Chris, was a jerk. He told me I had to call the corporate office to cancel my order and get a refund because I was now outside of the return time frame. Imagine that, I can't return items I never received because too much time had passed and the reason that much time had passed was because of their gross incompetence. So I call the corporate office and find out it wasn't necessary - everything that needed to be done could have been done in the store and I didn't need to do an RMA. OH - and they could get someone out to my house that same day because of the inconvenience but it was far too late for that. Chris made it clear he didn't want my business and I had no value to him because his store had already gotten credit for my purchase. In any case, I cancelled my $4,000 appliance order and purchased the exact same items at Home Depot who will be delivering and installing the next day... plus I saved an additional $500 for the EXACT SAME ITEMS with delivery, installation and haul away of my old appliances. Don't waste your time with Best Buy - you'll soon discover it's the Worst Buy you can make!!",0,1

Best Buy,Do not do business with Best Buy!!,"If you could give no stars and write a review I would. We bought a stove from Best Buy and it has been the WORST NIGHTMARE I could have imagined when buying an appliance. The crew caused significant damage to our kitchen floor. My husband explained our unique flooring and offered to help 2 different times while the crew was here. They declined. Then they acted as if nothing happened, said nothing, and quickly left. They did not properly instal the stove. It isn't level and the bottom draw is a COMPLETELY different colour! The stove is black stainless steel and the drawer is blue! It's not even the part that goes with the stove, there is even a separate sales sticker. When customer service was contacted in regards to the damage done to my kitchen the first representative was helpful. I spent longer than expected on the phone, however, he offered acceptable customer service. Then I called back in regards to the damaged product and received terrible customer service. The women who answered the call was trying to be helpful and received now support for her coworkers or managers. Representatives were even hanging up on each other when trying to figure out answers. Departments could not work together. I was offered a $96 gift certificate in replace of a new stove - which is what I paid for and got totally ripped off! I spent over $1,000 in total on the appliance. I have been on the phone for over an hour and no one has a resolution. I am still on hold and am starting to think they have simply brushed me off. Beyond disgusted right now and will NEVER buy from or recommend Best Buy for any future purchase. Customer service is critical. We all make mistakes it's what you do with them that counts. Clearly, Best Buy and Geek Squad Authorized Providers have no respect for their customers or pride in their work and products. Certainly, the ones we have worked with have not demonstrated any.

We have been rescheduled for delivery at least twice for no specific reasons but "" the technician decided not to deliver it today""... it feels like our destiny is in the hand of any delivery person that day.. and we poor customers can only sit there and wait for hours for the thing to show up but being defeated. Let alone the work we have to take off to wait for the delivery and the hours we spent on endless calls with customer service rep on the call... and apparently no one from best buy can help us, even after escalation to their supervisor. One girl called Laura from Mid west customer service center was so cold and rude, after waited on line for hours to speak to supervisor, all she said was her department couldn't do anything about this, good luck. When we requested to pick up from the store ourselves, we were told it's not possible. When we asked for a replacement that was able to be delivered on time, the store wanted to charge us for extra $200 without being able to provide any discounts that was close to our original order. It is beyond horrible, it is almost like a scandal, for an official store that carries a brand name like this, it is a shame to the society. They should claim to be out of business with this type of attitude to run their operations and treat their customer, if they haven't, I'll pray for them to be out of business every day.",0,1
Best Buy,I bought a laptop Sunday,I bought a laptop Sunday. The laptop required a factory reset every 15 minutes so I exchanged it for the same model 2 days later. The new laptop did not have a functioning space bar. I then went a 3rd time to Best Buy to get a different model and the salesman informed me that I could download their app to see if they had it in stock and then he walked away. Then he informed that they don't sell it at any best buy store but they sold that model online.... at an increased price than the manufacturer (Dell). I'm not sure why they would not have it if the whole purpose of buying something in the store is to test the product and then charge you more than the actual manufacturer.,0,1
Best Buy,Same!!,Same!!! I feel everyone here because story seems to be one of the same as the rest. Don’t buy appliances from Best Buy it’s a joke. Ordered a dishwasher September 3 and was supposed to receive it today got a confirmation call from the gentleman that was to deliver it two days ago. Then this morning after I already took the day off to make sure I’m here I get the phone call that it’s not coming. Later came a phone call that they don’t even have it (yes a month after I ordered it) and they will deliver it October 30. Another three weeks. Let’s just say I’m not super convinced it’ll make it that day either. Beyond unprofessional with total lack of customer service. They don’t even pretend to act like they care.,0,1

Took off work for the day of delivery but never received a confirmation phone call, only one email. Waited for the EIGHT HOUR window and... no dishwasher. We couldn’t contact anyone in person for about a half hour. Finally my husband got someone in person and they fed us some lie about how they couldn’t cancel the transaction tonight and it had been routed for delivery, but the delivery guys didn’t know about it??? Finally got a manager on the phone and he told us the same. Just called our credit card company and we are disputing this transaction ($1300), which they already charged us, and which unfortunately we have already paid. I’m done with Best Buy.",0,1

Best Buy,Purchased appliance from Best…,"Purchased appliances online from Best Buy with delivery and installation. Scheduled the delivery day and took the day off of work. I received a phone call that morning to tell me that they could not deliver my appliances and that in 24-48 hours I would get a call to reschedule. I called Best Buy for help. They also could not help me get my items delivered that day. I was also told that it would be at least another week before I would be able to reschedule. I couldn’t wait that long, so I asked that my purchase be canceled and I be refunded so I can go out and purchase appliances the same day. I was told that only the installation could be refunded ($.01) and that I would need to call back in 24 hours to request again a refund for the appliances. That didn’t seem right to me that I would be asked to do this when Best Buy is the one who is letting me down, so I asked to speak to the manager. I then waited 55 minutes to talk to the manager because he was “busy.” Finally got to talk to the manager after an hour. Was told that they cannot even call the warehouse to talk to someone about our delivery. They could only send a message to them regarding our order with no guarantee of any response. They could not refund my appliance purchase because it was in “delivery” status and I would have to wait for this as well. So now I’m stuck without appliances and no refund so I cannot go out and buy appliances on the day off that I scheduled for this. Terrible experience. The assistance/answers were not sufficient when I spend over $2000 on this one purchase. Will never purchase anything from Best Buy again.",0,1

It was two days before tax free weekend. The sales person Dominic told me they had one left in NY and I should order it now. I did purchase it and did not get the tax relief. Delivery date 9/28/20. Get a text moved till 10/5/20. Call and complain about this and am told it will definitely be here on 10/7/20. Imagine my surprise wheN i get a text in the middle of the night Lat night with a delivery date of 10/21/20!!! When i check my best buy account, no record of the purchase.

Best Buy,This has been a nightmare!  BestBuy should be ashamed!,"This has been a nightmare!!! We ordered a dishwasher and also paid $24.99 for our old dishwasher to be picked up and recycled. The Sales person, Jerome B.) and the guy who installed the dishwasher (Asa C.) were both great. However, the people who were supposed to pick up the old dishwasher called for picklup before it had been disconnected. When we called back after the dishwasher had been installed, and asked that they pick up the old one, they hung up on us. The installer tried calling them, from his phone, and asked to speak to their supervisor, and they hung up again! So we called BestBuy and waited over an hour to reschedule a pick up, only to be told that they couldn't do anything because the order was ""in transit."" We were to call back in 24 hours. We called on Sunday, waited another hour, only to be told it was still ""in transit"" and they couldn't help. When I went outside, it turned out that most of the dishwasher was missing, i.e., someone in the area had taken it. I asked if they could just give us a $24.99 refund. They said they couldn't do that, because the order was ""in transit,"" but try again on Monday after 8:30am and it shouldn't be ""in transit"" anymore. I called the number I was given, and once again waited for at least 2 hours, only to be told, AGAIN, it was ""in transit."" My husband then went on ""chat"" and conversed with 3 different agents (they kept referring him to someone else). Each time he had to repeat the order number and problem, After another hour, ultimately, being told AGAIN, that we needed to check back in 24 hours! This is ridiculous. The waste of time for $24.99 is outrageous!!! We can't waste anymore of our time! The live phone people were all wonderful and polite, but the service BestBuy is providing is awful! If there was a way to show Zero Stars, that's what I would have done.",0,1

I am a college student trying to manage online learning and I need a new laptop. I went in store to buy a mac book pro with apple care and received a free pair of airpods, what I was told were free at least. They shipped it to me, but it never came in and I could not track the package either. After calling about 10 different times over the course of a couple weeks I was finally able to get my refund, however they only refunded me for the laptop and not the apple care. I had to call apple separately because best buy's customer service was terrible and not helpful at all. I then came to find out that they had originally charged me for the airpods that I was told were free. I have never seen worse customer service in store and through the phone and will never be giving them my business again.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy equals nightmare,"Best Buy should close their doors if can’t handle delivery and installation of 4 kitchen appliances. In August we placed our appliance order in a store in MA. From the beginning this order was messed up, first they set up the delivery for the wrong address which we had that corrected even before we left the store. Since everyone knows appliances are all back order, we were set up to receive EVERYTHING on the same day beginning of September. We received emails confirming our appointment for that day, we took the day off to receive and have all appliances installed and old ones hauled away. The day of the delivery, we only received one item when we were supposed to get all 4. Was on the phone with Best Buy the whole day between the store and regular customer service people. Nothing got resolved, the next 3 days on the phone with Best Buy every day and we only received 2 items but nothing installed. The next week we were promised the installation will happen and the last item would get delivered. Now we are 4 weeks later and we still have our appliances in boxes without installation and missing a stove. DO NOT PURCHASE anything from Best Buy!!!!!! We will never step foot in a store ever again. We wasted so much time on the phone with them, on one of the days I was on the phone with them for 6 hrs! It’s crazy when you spend over $5000 to have these kind of issues. In the end Best Buy cost us money and time. Do not make the same mistake as us, take your business someplace else.",0,1

Best Buy,Don’t buy at Best Buy bc it’s actually worst buy,"If I could give Best Buy a zero star Rating I would. Bought a stove in August With delivery install and haul away service. Due to back order, the order was Scheduled to deliver in September. First delivery driver didn’t stop bc he said he couldn’t find parking. However he did manage to mark installation and haul away as completed. Told Best Buy to send a small trick for the reschedule. Second delivery driver Stoped but couldn’t stay long bc they couldn’t park and they had a big truck. The delivery guy came upstairs to look at the layout of the hallway and kitchen ensuring the oven would fit through fine. Reschedule again for a small trick. Third delivery came with a small pick up, found their own parking, but said they needed two more people to haul away and two more to carry the new oven up. They are two men short. Fine. Fourth delivery rescheduled for small pick up and four men team. ... received a voicemail 1.5 hours before the appointment that the delivery is rescheduled for Mid November. I am two months into the whole ordeal. Talked to numerous customer service rep and managers. Everyone has been super nice and apologize but in reality the core of best buy is rotten. They couldn’t help with anything. After the customer service manager that promised to reschedule my fifth delivery from November to something closer, she ghosted me. I phone back no able to get any manager on the phone. So I canceled my order only to find out that I cannot get the full refund bc ... the first delivery guy already completed they installation and haul away without setting his foot in my door. Mind you by this point I have had to call Best Buy over 8 times repeating my ever growing story of frustration.",0,1

Thought I'd have better luck with new upgraded appliance. $600 for Open Box dryer and $850 for new dryer. After being being placed on hold for 40 some minutes they stated the old dryer would have be brought back to store and the new dryer delivered. Yes this the same address.

Taking them 2+ months. I have the exact address and time and date that these transactions happened but they still want me to front partial cost for it. I explained I haven't made a purchase from Best Buy or use the card for since June which I paid off that month, and the fraud occurred in August. Still, they sent me a new card that I never received (in September) I told them I never received it, and they sent me a new card and I haven't received that either. Each time I contact them they make a new ""case"" I guess, because I called for a follow up in September and October, and they can only tell me that I reported it on the date I called in for updates. Like WHAT? Can we please go look back and look at my actual account history. On top of this, they want to lower my credit limit, because I refuse to pay off something that I reported as fraud.How is it that Hotmail and Apple can see my IP and location when I login or make any kind of transaction but Best Buy cannot see that I obviously don't live in 3 different states at once? How is it that Best Buy and Citibank wants me to pay for part of something, when I was the one who got robbed?I am writing a review everywhere because that is terrible business.",0,1
Best Buy,Unreliable,"I spent many hours researching washer dryer sets before finally deciding on the make and model I wanted. When I finished, there was only one model that met all my criteria. It was the right brand, the right size, the right color, on sale for the right price, and most important, it was the only model that had certain features that were important to me at that price point. The features I wanted were available in more expensive washer dryer sets, but those units cost at least $1,000 more.The only downside was that Best Buy couldn’t deliver the set for 6 weeks. That was inconvenient, but having that model was that important to me. After 4 weeks of managing with no working washing machine, I received an email stating that my order had been canceled due to a problem processing my credit card payment. This was patently untrue since they had charged my (brand new Best Buy) credit card 4 weeks prior, on the date I placed the order.I phoned them but I was told that it was impossible to reverse the cancellation because the set I wanted was now no longer available. I wanted to know who canceled my order and the real reason why. I wanted to discuss possible solutions. They felt no obligation to address the situation. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told no one was available. I asked them to have a supervisor phone me back but I’m still waiting. Had I known Best Buy was unreliable, I would have ordered a less expensive set from another vendor that met almost all of my criteria, but that option is now gone as that set is sold out.I shop for appliances for house flips and rental units. I’ve used Best Buy before without a problem, but after this experience, I will never use them for anything again.",0,1
Best Buy,Best price but borderline FRAUD,"After looking for a computer I found BestBuy had the best price on the one I was looking for. The web site said the Masonville store in London had 2 in stock, so instead of waiting for one to be shipped I proceeded with the purchase this was Sept. 1. On the checkout screen it clearly stated that my credit card would not be charged until the item was picked up. I made the purchase and waited for the confirmation email that the computer was ready to pick up, it didn't come. After 3 days I assumed something had gone wrong and the purchase never went through. I wasn't worried about it because the site said my card would be charged until I PICKED UP the items purchased. The next week Sept. 10 when going through my junk mail I noticed the email from BestBuy dated Sept. 8 that the computer was ready for pick up and my credit card had been charged. I was unable to pick it up because I'm a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair and home bound. I had designated my son as the person who would pick it up, but he was now out of town. Now highly irritated I was still not worried because the email stated if the items where not picked within 5 days the order would automatically be canceled and my card refunded within 4-6 days. Yes, the card that was not to be charged at all before pick up. So I began the wait for the refund, expecting it by the 19th. Monday Sept. 28 still no refund, so I call Customer service and explain to Ann what had happened. She wanted to know if I was wanting the computer or was I looking for a refund. I said I really need the computer as mine is giving me the blue screen of death and shutting down sporadically and could I get the $100 discount as that computer was now on sale. She put me on hold and said she would contact the store. When she came back she told me she was talking to Shawn who she thinks is a manager, he doesn't know what happened and cannot find a record of the transaction but will get to the bottom of it and call me in 24-48 hrs. This morning was day 2 with no phone call. I was deciding what to do call customer service again or the police to report the fraud (thinking about it, no law was broken just good business practices) when the email came in showing the refund.This morning a business associate of mine was here and I was telling him the story when he told me his. Last year after being a member of the Geek Squad for several years he went to the same store with a computer problem only to be told his membership is expired.

Best Buy,customer service sucks,"Today is 9/29/20, and we have been without a fridge since the middle of August. Originally the ice maker stopped making ice, which we could live without until it was fixed. Tech came on 8/21 and supposedly fixed it, said it was a dust problem which was bull shti, it functioned good for two days and stopped again. This time the upper fridge and freezer's temp started to get warmer and immediately called again and tech said I needed a new compressor and he ordered the parts to come to our house with an Oct 6 date for him to come fix it again After scrambling to find a home for our food, we ended up to tossing two bags of meat veggies and fruit. So please, please don't buy from them, because you're just asking for trouble if something goes wrong and needs fixing and we even bought a extended warranty to boot. Once you leave the store, your on your own. Customer service is the worst i ever dealt with. You can never get a hold of anyone with a human voice. This is the second time I've been thru this with them and had to involve the BBB's help to put them in their place the first time.

On the morning of the delivery day, the Best Buy consultant texted to inform me that the refrigerator was on its way. They gave me a six hour delivery window. The refrigerator never showed up. I received no call from the consultant or the truck driver. I tried reaching the consultant (Richard Merritt) but he turned off his phone. I spent two hours trying to speak to someone on the Geek Squad call center. I was told the refrigerator was on back order and wouldn't be available till November. I called my local appliance store. I thought a small shop couldn't get product due to Covid19, I was wrong. They have figured out ways to compete against the big box stores. They are also more knowledgeable and provide significantly better service than Best Buy. They were able to get the refrigerator I wanted, at a slightly lower price. I will never waste my time with Best Buy again.",0,1
Best Buy,DO NOT SHOP AT BEST BUY,"DO NOT SHOP AT BEST BUY! If I could give it a minus star, I would! I bought a laptop - HP Envy x360 - mainly for the purpose of attending Zoom meetings. The microphone worked for about a week and then worked part of the time. I didn't buy their warranty, but they did allow me a one-time fix to reprogram it. It wasn't even reprogrammed correctly. Well, it didn't work and still doesn't. Because I didn't buy their warranty, I was allowed only 15 days to return it. The thing gave out completely after the 15 days had elapsed. They will not accept a return and they will not fix it. I have lost my money. I also bought a keyboard. All I wanted was a keyboard with raised keys. I didn't return it in time. There was no allowance by them even when I explained because of health issues I wasn't able to get out in this 115 degree heat in Phoenix. Now I'm stuck with a gaming keyboard that doesn't connect to my computer. So I cringe when I think about the cash I've thrown out the window, and I need that money! They are unreachable without fee. Calling is a waste and a nuisance because no ""live"" person is there to talk to. I go through steps, ""if you're calling for..."" Best Buy is a nightmare. I'll never set foot in one of their stores again.",0,1

Best Buy,stop the scalpers. limit the amount of pre-orders.,"I really liked best buy re-releasing films but i pre-ordered two movies. The scream blu ray collection and the faculty on blu ray two weeks before the drop day. 9/22. A lot of other movies also dropped that day. I received and email saying my order had been delayed and might possibly be cancelled. I checked there website and every classic movie dropping that day said ""sold out"". I checked amazon and ebay and all these so called pre-orders had been bought out and now are being sold there by scalpers for three to four times the actual amount of what best buy had listed. Best buy should have a limit on the number of items you can pre-order. They recently had judge dredd (1994) and it sold out. I went to ebay and they had it for 8 bucks so i didnt mind. When i ordered it, it came in an amazon envelope with ebay tape on it. Coincidence? Maybe but it's ridiculous that a movie that hasnt been dropped yet is sold out yet ebay and amazon have loads of pre-orders with best buy stickers going for ten fold. I mean even ten per-person is whatever. But there is people with a 100 copies? seriously?",0,1
Best Buy,Horrendous Cancellation Process,"My Complaint is about the horrendous process of cancelling a Geek Squad installation. I was getting a replacement tv from a warranty company and wanted Geek Squad to install it. The Squad from the Lancaster, PA could not schedule so I called their Squad's 800#.Called on a Tues. And install scheduled for Friday. Tried to cancel on Wed. Took 2 1/2 hours!! Wait time 6 min. became 41 minutes. Then disconnected!! Cancellation could not be processed online.Note: when I finally got thru, the agent (""Taylor"") was very helpful and, hopefully, the credit to my account has been issued.",0,1

After two attempts of not reaching an associate (hold time 23mins and 27 mins) website said item pick up item in one hour. Drove 45 minutes each way to get TV and upon arrival told they didn't have any. Complained to blond haired girl talking to two other employees at door about this, she said sometimes the inventory on website is wrong. Told her I'd take it up on a BBB complaint, took two steps away with my young child and she says ""F#ck-you"" to me and they all laugh thinking it's funny. After returning home, I'm looking at their website, took the item all the way to check out and it still says pick up in one hour",0,1

I waited for 4 days. They didn't show up.I called at least 10 times. And the waiting time on the phone is always 30 minutes+.A few time they said they raise it to their supervisors.

Best Buy,Total Tech Support is actually Zero Tech Support,"I pay for Total Tech Support. I set up an appointment for them to come to my house to fix my printer and a couple of computer issues. I'm a business owner and had worked until 11:30 pm the previous evening so I would be available, and at home, for the 12:00 pm time slot they'd set up for me that I had to wait a week to get. I'm supposed to have priority service with TTS. I tried fixing the issue by calling their 800 support line, but that is talking to people from halfway around the world who are really uninterested in fixing the problem, so after being on 1 phone call for over an hour being passed around to various people and being hung up on, then calling back for a second try to be passed around and hung up on (see a pattern here?), I set up an appointment. Yesterday I got a voice mail mid-morning from the tech, she would be at my house between 2 and 4 so I rearranged my schedule. At 4:45 I called her cell. The recording says that her work day ends at 4 pm and I need to call an 800 number TO RESCHEDULE. I called the 800 number, and spent half an hour being bounced around from fake recording to fake recording, until I had the idea to call their sales people at the local store. I again was bounced through various menus, and called a couple times, then got in my car while on hold and drove to the store, walked in, and a human (!) picked up the phone. After 15 minutes on the phone with her (another indifferent person not interested in figuring out what was going on) she checked a schedule somewhere and said I would need to call to reschedule, and the soonest would be over a week away. I said, ""well that's not right, why is the tech not showing up at my house first thing tomorrow? I didn't miss an appointment, the person didn't even show up or call to say she couldn't make it!"" I told her if I ever treated my customers that way, I would be immediately fired. Because I had called the store, I said where is your manager I want to talk to them. She said, ""Oh I'm the call center blah blah"". So I hung up, and went to the geek squad counter to get some real human help. As it turns out, the appointment you think you are making to get your devices worked on, when you pay $300 per year for priority, unlimited help (you do have to pay a reduced fee, but still what the heck am I receiving for this? Nada.) is just fake nothingness. There is now, in my account, in big red letters for yesterday's scheduled date a note that says, ""NEED TO SCHEDULE"". So I get to start all over, and it is once again a total crap shoot if someone shows up at my house, and of course they aren't going to call or text or let me know in any way if they are going to show up and do the work. There is absolutely no one who takes responsibility, there is no supervision, there is no management to talk to. I've wasted over a week, and I've wasted hours of my time. They need to put responsible humans on the phones who will do the work they're hired to do. They need to get rid of people who finish out their day without at least checking in with clients who they stood up. I'm going to go back in the store to use another hour of my time closing my fake ""Total Tech Support"" account and will hire a real company. Lesson learned. You will note on Best Buy website there is a review function, but after the one I wrote yesterday, I can't add to it, and I can't write another review to warn people about this. You'll note that the ratings are very high. From the time I wrote mine - specifically for the store in my neighborhood, my review is gone, and there are a bunch of glowing reviews there, giving them a very high rating. Don't believe any of it.",0,1
Best Buy,We don't need to keep Best Buy in business.,"I successfully pre-ordered a Sony PS5 console from Best Buy. They then canceled my order after 24 hours and claimed that it was due to an issue with my card. This was not true. They also stated they would not charge my card until the item shipped (In November 2020). This was also false. They charged my card $529.99 immediately. When I called the ""24/7"" customer service line it said they were closed. I called in the morning and none of the customer service reps cared about my issue and continued to blame me and essentially call me a liar. It was bad enough that the reps could barely speak English. Nobody admitted fault on the part of Best Buy or even apologized. They told me the money never left my account and that me and the bank were wrong. It has been almost 1 week and my money is still not returned to my card. I do not want the money back. I want my item which I fully paid for. Keep in mind the only reason I chose to pre-order with Best Buy was to build my rewards points. The PS5 and XBOX Series X from Best Buy will be the same from any retailers. I have been a loyal Best Buy customer for 15 years. Because they never admitted fault, because they called me a liar, because they refused to make this right, because they took more pre-orders than they had available, because $529.99 is missing from my account I am done with this company and excited to only spend my money at Amazon.com as we all should. The first customer service rep even admitted that this happened to a lot of people. The other reps said just wait and the money (that they never got) would be returned to my card. Why not have a human being issue cancelations of pre-orders? A computer shouldn't have this ability. My experience was tarnished and my trust betrayed.. Best Buy you just lost a customer of 2 decades and I know there are more out there like me.",0,1

I was never told this was a diagnosis appt, I assumed it would be fixed by the time he was done. This is pitiful customer service not to let us know this up front and leave us without a working dryer for over two weeks. As usual, best buy doesn't have customer service in mind. Spent 20 minutes on best buy customer service chat and the outcome was ""I apologize but please just wait till next week for your appt"". Best Buy just passing the buck and getting to things when they feel like it as usual. I couldn't be more furious over this and will be sure to not purchase any appliances there ever again, not that they care.",0,1
Best Buy,DO NOT PURCHASE THE WARRANTY!!,"I purchased appliances through bestbuy as a package deal at a very reasonable price! The sales rep gave my husband and I the spill on purchasing an extended warranty. My husband and I thought it would be wise to at least purchase the extended warranty on the refrigerator at least. So sure enough our refrigerator stopped getting cold 9/7/2020. We lost all our food. We called geek squad and they gave us a number to Anderson repair company. This company 1st available appointment was 9/16/2020. The repair guy couldn't fix the problem but did give us a diagnosis of what was wrong. Bestbuy geek squad was called back and notified. They said they had to wait until they got the report before they could go any further. The repair guy said he sent a report before he left our home because of course he had to hear about us being without a refrigerator and spending lots of money eating out. My husband called Anderson requesting the unrepaired report and they stated they sent it to best buy. My husband calls best buy back and they stated they found it. So now we have been set-up with a repair company through Sears called A and E repair services. This company suppose to come and fix the problem that Andersons couldn't. Their first available appointment was today, 9/22/2020. They called and stated that we have to reschedule because the technician called off sick. So now we are rescheduled until 10/6/2020. Geek squad was notified and stated if we do not get a repair done in a month they will just put us into a replacement program. We are scheduled 1 day before a whole month of being without a refrigerator for a repair and before we are eligible to go into the repair program. I said all that to say this; IT IS CHEAPER JUST TO BUY A NEW REFRIGERATOR! DO NOT BUY THE WARRANTY!! THERE WERE DAYS MY HUSBAND WAS ON THE PHONE WAITING FOR 2HRS!!",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy customer service quality is based on how much you spend with them,"I bought an LG TV that came with a magic remote, I liked it so much I ordered 2 more for over $1300. The 2 new TVs I ordered were the same price and listed with the same information, but when they came they had the standard remote instead of the magic remote. The magic remote is much more convenient! So I called to exchange the TVs and they wouldn't do it. The reason was because I didn't spend enough money at Best Buy this year. That's right, they give you 30-45 days for returns/exchanges if you spend $1500+/yr and only 15 days if you spend less. I think it's bad business to treat customers differently based on how much they spend at your store. I own a small business and I treat EVERYONE the same, regardless of how much they spend, as it should be. I'll be buying my electronics at Costco from now on.",0,1

And they asked me to re-place the order (which is impossible as the PS5 Pre-orders were gone in seconds).Really ridiculous considering how much trouble i had to go through to place that order before the stock ran out. Will definitely never shop at best buy ever again. Save yourself the time and struggle and avoid them at all costs.",0,1
Best Buy,never received ipad,"I am writing about an absolutely horrible experience I had purchasing this ipad pro from Best Buy. It supposed to be delivered on 8/29/20. I was notified by Bestbuy email that it had arrived via the carrier Ontrac at 1:25pm at my apartment’s Amazon hub locker. However, I never received an email notification that it had arrived at my locker. I called Best Buy and Ontrac multiple times after not receiving the package. I contacted Best Buy via online support to notify them that I never receive the package. They said at that time that they could reship the missing item or refund my purchase after they performed their own investigation. I also called Ontrac to report that I never received the package. They said that they would open an investigation and contact the driver that was on duty that day. After several more calls to Ontrac, they told me that the package was confirmed to have arrived at my address via GPS and driver query. After following up with Best Buy multiple times regarding the status of the investigation, they told me that I was not eligible for a refund and that I HAD TO FILE A REPORT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT THERE NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO HELP ME. I could not believe that I had to go through so much trouble just to track down my own package. I then called Best Buy several times to get an explanation for why the investigation had been closed. Each time the representative was dismissive and said that I needed to contact the carrier (which I already did on multiple occasions), that I needed to contact my manager, or that I had to file a police report. After multiple attempts, I was finally connected with a supervisor that initiated a 3-way call with Ontrac. At that time, Ontrac reported to the supervisor and I that the only way Ontrac would reopen an investigation would be for Best Buy had to file a claim with Ontrac. Following that call, the Best Buy supervisor told me that they would reopen my investigation if I filed a police report. At this point, I said that I would go ahead and file a police report with the LAPD. As of right now, I still have not received an update from Best Buy regarding the status of this investigation. At this point I started digging for more information myself and called both Amazon and my apartment manager for records of incoming and outgoing packages for my apartment, which confirmed that my package never arrived. I forwarded this information to their customer care and the only reply I got was that they told me to stop emailing them. I am utterly disgusted by the customer service at Best Buy. I have been playing phone tag with them and Ontrac, and no one is able to help me locate or replace this ipad! I have wasted countless hours on hold and retelling my story dozens of times. I have made numerous electronic purchases from Best Buy in the past year and I am shocked at how poorly they are at resolving the simple issue of a missing package.",0,1

I am actually now on with a Special Forces agent (after 45 min wait) who put me on ""brief hold"" going on about 10 minutes now - I would not be surprised if she never comes back on or i am hung up on. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Am very unhappy - time to consider purchases elsewhere.",0,1

Best Buy,Purchase of TV STAND,"My wife and I needed to purchase a TV stand. She did the research and selected tv stand by Insignia (model NS-HWMG1754G/NS-HWMG1754M) and sold by Best Buy. The first stand arrived by the carrier and the entire glass shelves were shattered. We called carrier and they came to pick it up. My wife really enjoyed the look of the stand, so I took her to Best Buy and purchased the same stand again to be delivered to the store for us to pick-up.We picked up the stand from Best Buy and the box looked like hell. The guy that loaded it in my truck wasn't interested in loading it without possible damage. We got the stand at home and the stand was damaged again. There is a chip out of the top glass shelf and the right door was broken. I called the store and the Insignia and neither provided any help. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM BEST BUY AGAIN. AND IF THE SUBJECT COMES UP WITH MY FRIENDS I WILL ADVISE THEM TO BUY SOME PLACE ELSE.",0,1
Best Buy,BEST BUY IS THE WORST,"BEST BUY IS THE WORST, NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!!!!! If I could give them a zero I would. Purchased a new laptop from them with full warranty last summer. Thing completely broke 8 months later. Brought in for repairs with a working hard drive which they broke within 48hours of having AND charged me a ridiculous fee of $1500 to get my irreplaceable data back, even though I had the warranty. Now they have finally sent the machine out to their service center (after taking 8 weeks to mess with the hard drive) and they have had it at their service center for 2 weeks with no updates whatsoever. Not to mention they are impossible to contact with questions short of going into the store itself. I rue the day I ever purchased anything from them and will never, ever do so again.",0,1

Best Buy,They couldn't care less about their customers.,"If you have any issues with your purchase, Best Buy makes it next to impossible to report or resolve the issue with anything less than an in-store visit. There is no point in even trying to call the store, as you are bounced around thru the IVR indefinitely. Sadly, I have made 2 significant purchases in the Downingtown store in the past 2 years and both times there were significant issues. After spending 2 hours on automated phone IVRs and then driving to the store, I really didn't want to hear about how their call lines are backed up. Best Buy's lack of respect for the customer is simply not acceptable.",0,1
Best Buy,TERRIBLE WARRANTY SERVICE!!,"TERRIBLE WARRANTY SERVICE!!! If your thinking of purchasing appliances from Best Buy and getting warranty DON'T!!! Save your money and time. It's not worth it! I purchased a LG Refrigerator in 2018 and on July 2020 called on to Geek squad for a fan noise and cooling issues. They contract out to some ""Special Forces"" who hires who ever is available looking to get a quick service repair check that genually do not know what the heck they are doing. Those guys came out 3 different times changed the board and what do you know it did not get it working. They passed it on to LG to have their techs come out. First tech on the LG side who contrasts out to Sears techs said it was the board or compressor had all that ordered again. Second Sears tech came and said it was the fan so had to order parts again! So long story short here I am Sept 10 2020 waiting another week with no Fridge. I have a one year old plus 4 other kids and I am having to purchase fresh meat or food everyday in mid pandemic because I don't qualify for a new unit because it's still ""repairable"" and It has to be over 3 months of repairs and 3 different times for each company putting me at 6+ months! Or Lg has to say it's unrepairable which they clearly never do until they have made as many repairs as possible. putting you out as many weeks as they like. That's the great customer service that Best Buy strives for. I was better off buying a new one and no warranty. I heard that Best Buy was going out of business not sure if its true but honestly see it happening in the near further.Update 9/24/20Sears tech have come out two additional times because they didn’t order the right fan. They ordered 3 additional parts to the 2 other parts they had already ordered and ended up not using any because the fridge is no longer repairable! Took this long and that many techs to get to this! Now I have to wait a week for LG to get the notes in their system from A and D repair service(Sears) and maybe then I will get my unit replaced.",0,1
Best Buy,Horrible Shipping Service!,"I ordered a Macbook Air on August 22nd, 2020. Once ordered, they told me the item would be delivered on September 4th. Two weeks pass by and still no email of shipping confirmation and the tracking number they provided wasn't being updated. Fast forward to yesterday, the item still hadn't arrived and the tracking number still showed no updates. I spent 2 hours on the phone with Customer service trying to figure out where my package was and why it hadn't been shipped yet. Best Buy rep. told me i should call UPS and see why they're holding it up. Ok. I call UPS. They tell me the package has not even been picked up from BB warehouse. Great! (not.) So I call BB back and after another 45 minutes on the phone with a customer service rep they tell me that they indeed still have the package and cannot tell me why it hasn't been shipped yet. At this point, it's been almost a month since I ordered the damn thing and it still hasn't even shipped! About an hour after I got off the phone with customer service the tracking information updated and my item is now set to be delivered today. Such a cluster, and waste of almost 3 hours.They shouldn't send emails stating the item has been shipped when it hasn't even left their warehouse yet. Super frustrating. -10/10. Would NOT recommend.",0,2

Best Buy,Disappointed,We purchased 3000 $ worth of appliances for our new house 5 months back from closing date. On the delivery date the driver called us way earlier than our delivery time but we were not home so he said we have to reschedule delivery as he has to go back to Denver. After that we tried to schedule delivery the earliest they can deliver is after 8 days plus the representative we talked to on customer service was rude to us. Really unprofessional of best buy. Now because of their drivers mistake we have to suffer. Never shopping here again. Wouldn't give even 1 star if there was option!,0,1
Best Buy,Still waiting......,"I purchased a television from Best Buy in Dover, Delaware, on August 14th.

I received several text notifications during the week to remind me of the delivery but never received a phone call the night before. I stayed home all day waiting for a delivery. As of 10 p.m. on September 9th the TV has not been received. After contacting Best Buy and remained on hold a total of 55 minutes. I was told that they missed my delivery and they would reschedule to September 15th. There was never an apology and an inquiry as to what they can do to make things better they just assumed that I would wait a total of a month for the delivery of my TV without any problems.

They call me from one house over on the main road, maybe 30 feet away from my door. I ask them if they can just park there and drop it off at my place, but NOPE they can't be more than 100 feet from their truck. It's literally 30 feet from my front door. No calls, no emails, I call the delivery crew, geek squard, etc. nothing. Finally after 6 hours I call Geek Squad again and they inform me that I have to call again tomorrow to setup delivery. I have to call.. Not them calling me. I say great, so i call tomorrow and get it delivered tomorrow? NOPE. They don't do same day delveries.

Best Buy,Cheated and stolen from…,"Wanted to purchase an insignia wine fridge. Original price was 599.99. It was completely sold out in store and online. I found a satisfactory open box open in Georgia. I paid for it online for 509.00 (total 635.00). When I picked it up it was completely packaged (couldn't check it). When I got home and opened the item the sticker was listed for 479. So was over charged. I attempted to reach out via phone and the agent was so rude. She said I would have to bring it back to Georgia so they can see the price. Then put me on hold when I asked to speak to a manager and was hung up on. I emailed customer service with the order receipt and a picture of the sticker price with the sku with lower price. My purchase, call and first email was 9/5. Today I get a response from best buy customer service. The new price for the item is now listed for 449. And 79 for the warranty (vs 89). I paid more money for an open box. The first email agent that responded me back tells me I can return it and get a price match of 381 for the satisfactory open item. I email back asked if we can avoid having to go to the store. Then get a response back from a different agent saying I can't get the 381 price. Then a response back completely contradicting that. Then a 3rd agent emails me back saying sorry no price match. I email back and again to no avail. Feeling completely defeated and I am just returning the item all together. If I can make the purchase electronically why not fix this, honor what the first agent said and provide a refund for the difference. I drove to another state for this cause there was no option to purchase online or near by. Nothing but frustration. I've never dealt with this at Amazon. I should have just purchased from them. Sorry and saddened as this ends my relationship with Best Buy and I will advocate that to family and friends.",0,1

Best Buy,Worst customer service and damaged products,"I have had the absolute worst experience with trying to buy an appliance from Best Buy. I bought a dryer, and it was delivered to me with a huge dent in it. The delivery guy tried to tell me, well, they'll probably just offer you some kind of discount or something. I said, no, I did not buy a dented dryer. So, they left that one and did a return/exchange. This was after taking off a whole day at work. Today, I spend my entire holiday waiting for them to deliver another dryer. They take the dented one out, bring in another one, and turn it on to test it. It makes a horrific noise like it is about to explode. The delivery guy said, it's not supposed to sound like that and even said he would not feel comfortable leaving it in my house in that condition. So, they take that one and bring back in the dented one. I have spent the other half of my holiday going around in circles with corporate trying to get some compensation for the dented dryer so that I do not have to do round 3 with taking off of work for a delivery. I was put through to 3 different people, and then finally told all they can offer me is a $90 in store credit. I said, no that is not good enough. The guy said he would talk to his manager and call me back. Of course, he never called back. I called again and got a totally different person who knew nothing of the situation. She said the best she could do was a $75 credit to my credit card. She was very rude. I think they should discount no less than $100 and maybe more to compensate for lost time. But no, that's the best they can do. So, now I am stuck between taking their paltry ""compensation"" or rescheduling yet another return/exchange. I am livid. I will never purchase even a piece of gum from Best Buy again.",0,1
Best Buy,The Price-Match Guarantee is a Joke,"I loooooved BB but this last incident made me a non-BB customer for life. I found a robot vac at Lowes for $250 marked down from $600. Because I could earn points on my cc if I used BB, I looked on their site. The vac was there for $600. I contacted BB customer service and two agents confirmed that the vac was qualified for a price match. CS said that because the discount was so large ($350) the way it worked was that I needed to buy the item (at $600) and the price match difference ($350) would be sent to my credit card as a credit. I bought the vac from BB. The NEXT DAY I got an email from BB saying they couldn't pricematch because the item was no longer available at Lowes. Like, of course it was gone NOW, it was 60% off! I wrote to them that the vac was available for price match when I bought it and that this was bait and switch. I never heard back from them. Btw they didn't cancel the sale, either. The $600 charge stayed on my cc until I disputed it with them. Obviously I didn't keep the vacuum.",0,1

Which went to a never ending ringing phone. I still don’t have the dryer installed. And the poor people who work there must be so used to being screamed at - they just look at you blankly. Stay away. Even if it’s free. Stay away. I love the box here that says they’ll notify bestbuy about my review. Good luck with that!,0,1

I then was told BY THE BEST BUY CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE that I had to cancel my protection plan on the camera.

A few weeks later, I get a call from the police department saying they recovered my camera. I call best buy to check on a plan coverage, and they stated they cancelled my plan since it was stolen. Then they told me there was no way to get it back. The representative refused to forward me to a manager or anyone else that could've helped.

I got transferred to that department and wait at least an hour on hold and no one answered, i called the following three days and got the same result; on hold for more than an hour so i just hung up and went into the store that Saturday and didnt get any answers so i asked for a contact in corporate and they were clueless. So i did my research and called the corporate office and asked to speak to the CFO Corie Barry and i get transferred to the corporate customer service which was no absolutely no help at all, i talked to someone named Scott and he told me he would look into it and called me back but never got a call back. So, i called back and asked to speak to him again cause geek squad made the decision to schedule an appointment without even talking to me. I asked Scott why did this happen and he had no answers for me and said he would look into and call me back but never got a call back.

Best Buy,Best Buy No Longer The Place To Shop…,"Best Buy used to be a store everyone wanted to shop at, sadly now it is just a shell of a business. You cannot get anyone to answer a phone, the service is inexplicably bad. I was always taught business attitudes come from the top down. It doesn't matter which store you go to, they are all bad. I took in my computer for repaiurs unknowingly that their policy had changed and you now had to make an appt. for that. With no one in line I approached the geek squad guy and was promptly told I had to have an appt. and the soonest was three weeks out, [still no one but me in line], then he found one a week out and btw it had to be shipped out, frustrated I stand there while he sets up the appt. [still no one in line but me] I explain the problem, get the appt. and turn to leave [still no one in line but me] and two geek squad workers standing there twiddling their thumbs. A week later I return for my appt. It took 9 days to ship my computer out per their emails, and then a week later I get a call my pc is damaged and they are giving me an in store credit. Mind you they no longer sell my pc and all others have to be ordered. Finally a week later I get my new pc, it doesn't work and I find out it is red tagged, so it was a computer that had been returned before or refurbished and I had paid full price for a new one. I no longer trust Best Buy and they have lost a customer who spent lots of money on Tv's, computers, and appliances with them over the years. Now trying to find a replacement for that one in all Houston stores and nothing in stock anywhere and I don't trust them to mail me a new one. Just another drop shipment business without my trust.",0,1

I told her that I will take my business elsewhere, her reply was she didn't care. I got the item for $50 less at Walmart. Best Buy really needs to train their employees in customer service.",0,1

Still never came. Filed complaint with BBB. Best Buy response promising to either fix it or give me a new freezer. Now I called in Aug for appointment. Still never came. Called them about this and they were very rude. So I filed another BBB complaint informing them Best Buy broke their deal we made. Called them again and they are still giving me the runaround.

Got a text message with 2 delays over 2 months and the third delay was another 2 months long. Best Buy would not honor the price and give me a similar appliance at same price. The only help they gave was asking me to cancel my order altogether. Oh, and the refund will take 10-15 business days so Best Buy, you're welcome for getting to use my $2400 dollars to earn income sitting in your account for the last 4 months while I waited for a double wall over.

Best Buy,I've had multiple bad experiences with Best Buy.,"I've had multiple bad experiences with Best Buy. First, I ordered a cell phone from them and the worker didn't scan it out of inventory so it was impossible to activate it. Best Buy wouldn't pay for me to return it so I had to waste time and gas to return it to the store. Then I had 4 installations done by Geek Squad. Due to a bug in their software, I couldn't add another installation to an appointment so they had to cancel it and start all over. The result was my installations were delayed by 2 weeks. Then when I wanted to cancel my Total Tech membership, I tried to do it online but the cancel button is just a ruse. They make you contact them by phone or chat to actually complete the cancellation. This of course is so they can try to talk you out of it. I unloaded my frustrations with Best Buy on the CSR and she didn't even bother to try to. I gave BB 3 stars only because the installations were done well and for $50 each because I was a member of Total Tech. My advice is to avoid BB unless you keep a close eye on them because whatever they can screw up, they usually will.",0,3

Count the number of times you are hung up on or routed to a different department.Evidence #3 We had a computer repaired for my daughter. She went back to school and it still did not work. She needs a computer however, the turnaround time for a repair is about 3 - 4 weeks. Evidence #4 Try calling them and select cell phone sales. Good luck! You will see what I mean.

Two days later, I received an email stating that there was a problem with my method pf payment and I needed to update my payment method in the next 24 hours which is very odd since I paid with the line of credit they approved my for. After spending 2+ hours on different days on the phone with Best Buy and Citibank customer service, looks like I got charged twice for everything and since my maximum credit line I was approved for was very close to my total amount of my purchase, there was an issue and my order was canceled. Now, Best Buy says is a Citibank issue and Citibank says it s a Best Buy issue. So, at the end, none of them wants to assume responsibility for this BS. The thing is that I wanted to take advantage of the no interest promotion and I bought much needed electronics for my children online school classes. So, I ended up with nothing and now the items are not available until September when I was supposed to pick them up today. This is unacceptable. Best Buy: you are a disgrace.

Just to have someone retrieve a item from the back or to unlock a case. In the time I spent waiting I purchased the items from different stores on my phone. Over $3,000 they had lost out of and I walked out the door. Today I saw associates helping customers but not in a friendly manner. You have to have pride and show friendliness in your job for people to want to come back. Today I witness this girl at customer service. She had no name tag and she was helping a customer in front of her. That did not stop her from turning her head and yelling across the room. “KEEP YOUR FACE MASK UP ABOVE YOUR NOSE”! You can’t get any more trasher then that. She showed no pride or concern to the customer that was right in front of her. How uncomfortable this customer must had felt. But again this is Best Buy and they show the ability to run off their customers. Thank goodness I did not need assistance. And thank goodness I did not need to go to customer service.

Best Buy,Never in my life have I had so many…,"Never in my life have I had so many problems with a businesses customer service!!! My order was shipped to the wrong state. They had my correct address, so it was not my error. The person who received it refused it. UPS attempted to deliver again, but to the wrong address again. It was refused again of course. I called Best buy to find out how this can be fixed. I spent hours being on hold, moved to different departments, and even hung up on at one point. They kept asking why I refused the package and sent it back. I had to repeat multiple times that it did not come to me. The person they were trying to deliver it to did. Also, I had used rewards points from my Best buy card that I had earned from my transactions with their credit card, to pay for part of the purchase. They told me they could refund my card but not the rewards. And, if I wanted them I would have to reorder them. I explained I should not lose my rewards when it was not my fault. Finally they agreed to let me reorder it for the price I paid, but actually it was slightly more. They said it was the least they could do for all of my trouble. Really? The least you could do is let me pay again, what I had already paid? I told them to ship to the store so I wouldn't have any more problems. Then I went to the store I had asked to have it shipped to. They told me they didn't have my order, it was at another store. Really!?! I didn't have time to go that day so I figured I would go another day. I did not know they had short hold times and planned to pick it up 4 days later, when I was able to go. It's a small item so I didn't think it would be a huge deal. The night before I planned to go, I get an email saying they canceled my order because I hadn't picked it up. What the!?!? So I called that store specifically. The line would ring a bunch of times then hang up. Then I tried messaging them online. Spent a half hour on there, and was told they can't help me. She gave me a number to call. I called, waited for a call back, got a call back was on the phone another half hour, and was told AGAIN, they could not help me. They would have to transfer me to another department. The hold time is just 20 minutes he says. I didn't have time to be on the phone any longer so I would have to call later. I have already spent so much time and energy trying to get this fixed! I am just astounded by how badly they're handling their customers! No actually I'm FURIOUS!!! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!! I decided it's not worth my sanity to fight with them anymore, so I am just going to let it go. But I will NEVER return!!!",0,1
Best Buy,If I could give 0 stars I would!!  No Customer Service,"If I could give 0 stars I would, the WORST, forget about returning anything or exchanging it even if it doesn't work, and the only help you get is off shore call center where they read from a script and do nothing for you. Spent $500 for wireless range extenders and one never worked, they refused to exchange one even though it was only one week beyond the 30 day return per. and we are in quarantine, they did nothing and just told me to use manufacturers warrantee. DO not Buy anything here, should be called DON'T Buy.....",0,1

When we check on delivery dates we are told we have to wait for another 3 months for a fridge (back-ordered again). At this point, we have no fridge so we have to lose the bundle deal and pay $800 more for the same fridge. We are promised a $100 gift card ... 3 hours on the phone, lies, and yet to see that credit or gift card 2 months later. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy’s awful customer service access,"Best Buy customer access through phone and website are the worst in the business. Phone calls (877 numbers) are answered by call centers out of state (country?) with people with accents you cannot understand and can’t get you what you want. If you try to buy through the website and make a mistake entering your information (easy to do with a small iPhone) unlike other websites that allow you to re-enter your info Best Buy sends you a verification number to your email. Make a mistake on that and it completely wipes out all your customer account data. I then got the same product through Amazon — no hassles! I have a Geek Squad plan for TV and Internet, When I finally got the number for the local store no one answered the phone!",0,1
Best Buy,Best buy is the worst company around…,Best buy is the worst company around today. They should fold soon. Do not buy appliances from them and never take geek squad warranty.

Also they have people that couldn't hook up a garden hose if their life depended on it.,0,1
Best Buy,Blame the Vendor when the Going Gets Tough,"I strongly suggest not purchasing an appliance from Best Buy. After my first order they rescheduled so the install would be 5 weeks after my purchase. Fine, that's no problem. Then two days before install, they call saying there is ""vendor problem"" and there are ""coronavirus cleaning procedures"" that have pushed back the install date another 6 weeks. I objected and the customer service rep offered a ""gift card"" for an unspecified amount (to be revealed upon delivery). Needless to say these excuses don't wash... Best Buy is supposed to have a relationship with their vendors and somehow they don't know the correct delivery times? And cleaning procedures? Why wouldn't you build that into the estimate the first time? This is clearly evidence of a poorly run company. If you are in need of a fridge or appliance install, don't shop here.",0,1
Best Buy,"Given fake order number, fake case ID number","I talked to 9 agents. The whole process took a cumulative 3 hours of my time. All I needed was someone to price match a keyboard and place the order for me to pick up at my local best buy. The first 6 agents disconnected me in the middle of trying to place my order (even after sending me a payment form). The 7th agent finally ""helped me"" place my order and complaint for the horrible customer service I experienced. I was waiting for the confirmation email (2+ hours of waiting) until it hit me, he never asked for my card information, there was NO way he would've placed my order. I call the 8th agent, who confirmed that theory and stated he could not find my case ID number and the ""order number"" I received was not a Best Buy order number. He was transferring me to his supervisor when he disconnected the call. I'm still on hold with the 9th agent who really does NOT want to let me talk to their supervisor. This experience has made me never want to buy from Best Buy again. What a horrible and inefficient customer service department.",0,1

Best Buy,Scammed on Treadmill order,"I ordered a treadmill over a month ago. It was ordered, paid for and going to be delivered and installed. Two times the delivery date was changed due to “scheduling conflicts” as I was told. I was never given another delivery date so I contacted customer service to set one up. Was told that the treadmill was sold out and then the treadmill was unavailable in my area. Complete scam. They never once notified me that the equipment wasn’t available. I wouldn’t have even known that I wasn’t receiving the treadmill this week if I hadn’t called them looking for a new delivery date. Best Buy took my money for both the treadmill and installation knowing THEY HAD NO TREADMILL TO DELIVER TO ME!!! Spent hours on the phone and on chat wanting some sort of explanation as to which they were UNABLE TO GIVE ME ANY EXPLANATION. After 4 hours they transferred me to a department that would be able to find another similar treadmill that could be delivered to me- only to be offered one option more than double the price of the one I had already purchased. I have never in my life had such horrible and deceitful service. I will never use Best Buy again- no matter what. You shouldn’t either!",0,1
Best Buy,Don't trust what customer service reps say,"I'm tired of talking on the phone with customer service representatives. I ordered a laptop on August 3rd and it was sent via FedEx. As of Wednesday 8/5 I realized there was an issue with the delivery, I contacted BBY via chat on 8/6 and spoke with J. Oliver. I specifically told him that as of 13:01 that day, I received a text from FedEx stating ""Unable to deliver"" and on their page it stated ""No attempts made, schedule for next business day"". I felt he did not listen to me and tried to placate me by assuring me the laptop would be delivered by the end of day. It was not. And it still has a pending status as of 8/10. First lie from a representative! On 8/7, I viewed status of package on FedEx and it stated ""Scheduled delivery Pending"". At 10 am (9:57 specifically) I called BBY and spoke to a Cherry for 18 minutes. After explaining the situation, she reluctantly resent another laptop but via UPS this time. I asked her if anything could be done due to the delayed delivery and frustration with previous conversation and the entire situation. Apparantly trying to placate me and get me off the phone, she stated she could refund 10% off the cost of the laptop. That's the second lie. On 8/10, I received the laptop from UPS (the one from FedEx is still pending). At which time I called customer service to relay the delivery and to ensure everything on the backend was proceeding with the 10% discount. Also, the free Amazon plug was not included with the UPS package. I spoke with Omar for an hour. He basically stated that reps were only able to offer $40 if a package was lost and subsequently resent. Omar was very professional and apologetic, but this is hogwash. He did process the $40 and the resending of the Amazon plug. Towards the end I was asking for an email for customer service. He stated there was none available but that he would process our conversation and have a manager contact me within a few hours. Unfortunately, I don't know if he got all my information for this to occur. The phones were cutting out and I lost the call. It's 6 pm and I haven't received a call. I spent quite a bit on this laptop and have replaced other electronics in the past year from BBY. Not sure what elite status means if a customer gets lied to multiple times. I have yet to unpack the laptop, considering whether to return it or not. I would like to be contacted and have this made right.",0,1

Management gets paid top dollar and does not help to resolve customer experience... Overall a good company but dropping the ball with a so call Elite Plus member status means something is going wrong... So when making a purchase make sure a representative sends you a copy of the invoice on your purchase so you do not have to verify through Citi on the transaction process... Thanks Citi Bank!

I clicked on the tracking number to see where the UPS driver left it and it said that it was left at the front door AND it was signed DLVD; mind you my last name isn't DLVD, DLVD stands for delivered, a signature wasn't required and I live in a Condo which means that either someone has to buzz you in, in order to get to any of the floors in the building or you have to have a key fob WHICH, UPS or any other delivery service does not have. When I contacted Best Buy they said ,"" Of course, common sense is that DLVD means delivered but, someone signed for it"". For one, a signature wasn't required and two, my last name is not DLVD. I want my money back and if I have to take Best Buy to court in order to do so, I have no problem with that. Their customer service is horrible, their standards are poor and any company that ships with UPS as their carrier, you should never do business with. If there are any other electronic stores near you, I consider ordering from them instead. Never will I ever do business with Best Buy or order from anywhere that uses UPS again.

Best Buy,Terrible delivery and Geek Squad Experience,"I ordered a washer and dryer at Best Buy a little over a week ago. They both came in last Thursday and the delivery and installation person could not put on the dryer vent. Not a huge deal, nice guy. He said he'd put it in his notes and that I'd have to call customer service to get them to ""send a team out"". I called and they said the order was ""still in transit"" so they could not send someone out until after 72 hours. What kind of ridiculous policy is that? I'm not even sure what that means. Anyway, they said I'd have to call back to schedule an appointment. Yes, they didn't mean they'd come in 3 days. They meant that that's when I could call to schedule an appointment. I called yesterday and luckily they were able to get me an appointment for today after having spoken to so many of their customer service reps. I received an email this morning titled ""WE'RE ON OUR WAY"". It said their ETA was 10:35am. It is now noon and no one showed up. No phone call, no follow up email, nothing. I've now been on hold with Geek Squad for 33 minutes.On top of this, I also had a TV coming in today.

Best Buy,WORST experience EVER with Best Buy.,"WORST experience EVER with Best Buy, I purchased a High end appliance to have it left on sidewalk by PILOT freight company and driver refused to bring this 250 pound item closer to my house not to mention it arrived late and the appliance name was all over the shipping box. The lack communication within their third party Companies was disgraceful. I spoke to several agents that was unable to help me with updated accurate information before delivery. First the Appointment for install was made before the range actually was delivered I had to call and tell Best buy they made a mistake they told me yeah that doesn’t look right and then they was unable to contact the install company so they just told me to tell them when they arrive. They also was unable to make me a new appointment in place of the first one that was made in the wrong date. The install arrived told me they can set things up and the delivery can just connect. I had to tell the install man that I know for a fact a freight delivery person will be liable and connect a gas range, not to mention this is an additional service I paid to install. He then said ok well if they don’t you can call us back and we will come back. Several call in between wrong information one agent told me she when I called because the delivery was late that she doesn’t see the order out for delivery as my email stated she told me she thinks this may not have been shipped yet. So they have hauled away my old range and you can’t find updated information on my delivery? Now for the finale PILOT freight, if you ever see this company being used to deliver you item and a third party company please safe yourself the stress and cancel the entire order. If they had not already taken away my range I would have cancelled but at that point I hand to endure the rest which was the driver arrived late took the appliance out of his truck and left it at the end of my driveway near the side walk...I asked could he bring it closer at least to my house he told me he is not Best Buy they do not bring in the house. Currently I have an expensive appliance out in the open for the neighborhood to see because this company could not care enough to put it in a safe position. I will never purchase from this company again and I am very disappointed that such and exciting purchase has no been ruined with poor service, incorrect information and horrible delivery. Go anywhere else I should have went to Home Depot or Lowe’s this was extremely stressful as a consumer no accountability for the companies they are affiliated with that renders horrible service and there internal agents that can’t help because they have inaccurate information. Overall I spoke to about 8 different agents over the phone and on chat and not one person was able to help outside of taking notes and adding them on to my account. I was told it was out of their limit to call me back or schedule me another appointment. One agent disconnected and never called me back which put me back in the que again for another 20 min each call not to mention I’ve been home for 2 days waiting for appointments that still have not been completed so tomorrow will be the 3 day of my time spending to rectify all the mistake that was made I.

I set up to pick up curbside but the store closed 2 minutes before I got in there and the workers were there, the doors still open but couldn't have the courtesy to hand me the small package in San Rafael, CA store what I begged then to do it. OK, someone can say they are closed and doesn't need to do that. Fine. Then, I asked to shipping very worry because all the shipping companies out there doesn't really work, right? They hired UPS to delivery my package 2 days later. The delivery person probably can't read properly and delivered to a wrong address and a person, that just signed the name ""LORE"" , and the ""smart"" delivery person didn't ask for ID and left my package with this person that I have no idea who it's. It was not in my house. I live alone and I was in my house waiting for this package. Contacted Best Buy and they said that is MY PROBLEM and I have to deal with UPS, so, I had to buy the same product again at Best Buy and picked up myself and now I have to fight with UPS with a claim that I don't even know if I'll receive my money back. Best Buy should be the one that should be dealing with UPS. I regret that I didn't buy on Amazon because Amazon would take responsibility for my package and send me another the next day for free. I'm a long time customer in Best Buy and I'm very disappointed. They should give me the waffle maker for FREE based in my history of many years buying from them and pay on time and after what I had to go through with this problem like endless waiting to talk with Best Buy and UPS, btw Best Buy I could only use chat, they never answered my call. I buy for many years in Best buy but I never use the shipping delivery, I always picked up at the store. First time using the shipping because they didn't handle my package when I was right there!

Best Buy,I bought an expensive camera from Best…,"I bought an expensive camera from Best Buy, and I could not get a single question answered about it. I just needed to know the first step to setting up the camera for live streaming with zoom for my upcoming class. I was continually put on hold, and sent on a wild goose chase. The geek squad guy would not even chat with me about the camera, and when I initiated a call request he hung up with me not once, but three times! I still do not know how to use the camera for live streaming and my class is approaching soon. I viewed every video out there, but do not see the first step to take me to the correct window. I do not recommend anyone buying anything from this store, since they take your money, and then leave you to dry, although I am supposedly an elite member. What a waste of money, for purchase of help I never receive. I cannot believe I was transferred around 10 times, and hung up on four times! Their customer service is a JOKE!!!!",0,1
Best Buy,The Customer is NEVER Right at best buy,"We have spent tens of thousands of dollars at Best Buy over the years. Every television, computer, cellphone, appliance, laptop, gaming system, you name it, all purchased a Best Buy. We have had minor problems with them over the years, but all companies have employees who need more training from time to time. My husband called to try to resolve an issue that had been going on for two weeks. He was willing eat the money that Best Buy misplaced via gift card through an online order and simply charge the balance. After being hung up on three times and lied to by three different associates, he asked to speak with a manager and was disconnected yet again. He simply wants the game that he has already paid for; that's all. It would be a simple resolution, but how much time should he have to spend on the phone with these RUDE, UNTRAINED, FOOLS? Bill Gates said, “Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.” Maybe next time my husband should yell so that they know how unhappy he really is. The young people who have these jobs do not know how to listen. TEACH THEM! The problem is still not solved and he will have to spend another day off to fix their mess. We are NOT spending another dime at Best Buy. JENNIE BARRY you should really look at the crybabies who are being hired and teach them to listen.",0,1
Best Buy,Rude customer service,"I'm giving one star because I can't give zero stars. First, I'm trying to support brick-and-mortor stores but I will no longer purchase anything from BestBuy.com. They lost a customer simply because of their call center. I ordered a DVD and the box came empty (strike 1). I then called customer service and asked to speak to a manager and they hung up the phone (strike 2). I called back and the support person had a bad attitude because I wanted to speak to a manager. Imagine that, I'm the one who paid money for something that he didn't get and the support person has the attitude (strike 3). Hey BestBuy, outsourcing your customer support has now lost you at least 4 customers as we're a household of four with income of 200K+ who love's electronics.

They charged my card immediately, but its not showing up in my purchase history and I never received a confirmation email. I had to Google my issue to find out that it might take them several DAYS before they send out a confirmation email. Thats not acceptable as I have no way of knowing if my purchase went through.The forum is useless. It says on a stickied post to keep your order confirmation number - not something you would normally think to do as its not even mentioned on their main website. You even need a separate account from your BestBuy to even post on their forum to ask for help - further showing how disconnected the forum is from the main site. I attempted to create a forum account to try and get help, but apparently you need to verify your email to post and they can't even send you the verification email in a timely manner. If I can't get Best Buy to confirm my order, they certainly won't cancel it, so I might as well call my bank and just dispute the charges as Best Buy has no way of giving me proof that my order went through.",0,1

Best Buy,What a bunch of incompetents,"What a bunch of incompetents! I purchased a TV online and scheduled delivery at the same time. Then I started getting calls to reschedule but none of the links they provided were good, so I had to go into the store to find out what was going on (the whole reason I ordered on line was to avoid going into the store, but so be it). After resolving this problem (which they couldn't explain) I confirmed a delivery date and time frame. On the day of delivery, the driver called to advise he was on the way, then called and said the TV wasn't on the truck. We were then told that the TV was just arriving at the store and would be delivered in the next two days. When that didn't happen either, and we didn't hear a word from Best Buy, we finally called. We were then told that they TV wouldn't be delivered for ANOTHER two weeks. They just don't care. And it's not the first time I've had problems with Best Buy. It's not even the first time I swore never to shop there again, but it will be the last. Worthless.",0,1

Best Buy,No customer service!,"I ordered a television and was told delivery would be between 12 pm and 8 pm. My thought was, you cannot give a closer time than 8 hour window? Since it was out of my control, I spent the day waiting for delivery. After waiting 8 hours, they failed to show. I tried customer service, but they have wait times of 1 hour and 17 minutes. Obviously the store is closed, so I can’t get help from them. Best Buy has almost no in store customer service anymore and you can’t depend on them to deliver products when they say they will. Once this pandemic is over, I predict someone can put Best Buy out of business with just a slight improvement to customer service. After waiting 1 hour and 17 minutes for a call back, I finally got the call back. It said press 1 to speak with a customer service representative, which I did. Then, I got the message that I had reached them after their normal business hours and to call back during business hours. So, I paid quite a bit of money to have a television delivered today, had someone who was going to help me install the tv stand by with me all day and Best Buy didn’t have the courtesy to call and tell me they aren’t showing up and no one is working to provide any information. Great way to run a business!UPDATE: Finally got through to talk with someone. The delivery driver claimed he attempted to deliver the tv and no one was home. He took a picture of the house as proof he was there, but the picture he took was not of our house. Despite evidence the driver went to the wrong house, customer service stuck by their story they tried to deliver the tv. So, they are going to try again, 3 days after they were supposed to deliver it the first time. I wonder where they will end up this next time!",0,1

I ended up calling customer service.The rep said UPS should pick up the next day (4 days later) and deliver the day after or two (5-6 days later). I asked if he could change the delivery to next day. He told me he couldnt. I then asked if he could give me next day shipping on a different item I want to order or a discount code. He then says he can give me next day shipping on the current order -_- . I took it, and plan to not buy online from BB again unless it's a sale deal. I'd rather pay retail price from B&H, Adorama, or some other electronics store.UPDATE: Still hasn't shipped the item.

This guy now tells me there is no next-day delivery (seriously..), and I just have to wait it out. He says my other option is a refund and to drive 40 minutes to a different city best buy to pick up the keyboard. I then say ""Can you give at least a decent option other than waiting till Tuesday? A discount on the item, a discount on a future purchase"". Nope! This guy literally can't give anything except a full refund apparently (so what can he do?). Whatever, ship it to me Tuesday. He then says an email will come later in the day. I respond ""I don't trust you guys clearly, I want the email right now."" Oh... he can't do that either apparently.

Supervisor said that because so much time had lapsed I was not eligible for a return, despite confirming record of all my attempts. She criticized the week in which I didn't try (vacation), because apparently 10 attempts is not sufficient. She refused to send confirmation of any return label sent as well. I think that's fishy. She then hung up on me. But not before telling me to go into the store (during COVID) and try a return there so they could call her centre and be told it wasn't eligible so I could get turned away there also.

Eddie told us that was the story and he trusted the 3rs party company called Advanced Video in Port St. Lucie just to get told we will have to reschedule and there's nothing they can do. I asked to see if we could drop the TV off at Best Buy and was told they were not taking appointments for this at this time. This is the second time this has happened to us with Best Buy. We insure the product and then end up having to pay to replace it or they deliver the wrong product and they refused to take the incorrect one and trying to charge is for it. I am so dissapointed in Beat Buy. We are now stuck trying to figure this out on our own and play ng for the repair because according to the manager they don't have control over the 3rd party contracts. Very sad.",0,1

Best Buy,Worst customer service ever and partial…,"Overland Park, KS Store, Metcalf ----Worst customer service ever and partial to the younger generation. I am deeply disappointed by Best Buy. My 86 year old Mother bought a tv online. After she received it, she decided it was too small. She went ahead and bought another tv online. She was trying to find out how to return the tv. Her and I tried 3 numbers to get a hold of a human being and the phone rang and rang. My main complaint is the only option they have during the covid-19 pandemic is having an app on your phone. She is 86 and doesn't have a smart phone. I went with her to pick up her new tv and see about returning her old one. We parked in the curbside slot. There was no curbside help phone number provided. Since she didn't have an app, the employees ignored us. We waited in the car for almost 30 minutes. I am high risk myself but had to go inside and ask customer service. The employee said we have to have an app to pick up and have to go inside to return. I told him my Mother is high risk and is 86 so she won't go in. The employee said sorry that is the only way to buy and return. So we left without the tv she purchased and unable to return the tv since they didn't do it curbside and never answered her phone calls. That being said after this experience, I told my Mother to just cancel the order and order from somewhere else. My point is, that Best Buy can't assume everyone is app savvy especially the older generation. I will never shop BEST BUY ever again in my life!",0,1

I did that within 12 hours, they were very helpful, gave me a case number and told me the refund would take about 5 to 10 days. 2 weeks later no refund, I called them and got a hopeless operator who took 15 minutes to tell me it could take 30 days. Now I have to pay my credit card with $4600 worth of fridges on it which I don't have yet! Thank you WorstBuy!",0,1
Best Buy,Need appointment 2 weeks out to drop off for service,"Went to Best Buy in Savannah, GA to have a tablet serviced. Was told I needed an appointment, when attempting to schedule I was told the next available appointment to DROP OFF (not have any service done, not have anyone look at it, just drop it off) was 14 days from today (07/21 appointment). When I asked why I could not just drop it off today and then have them get to it on the 23rd I was told that the Corporate office does not let them touch the service items for 2 days once dropped off. Now I am not that smart, but if an item is dropped off on 07/07 and they dont look at it till 07/23 that seems like more than a 2 day quarantine. When I pointed this out to both the employee who was scheduling my DROP OFF and the assistant manager they both said this was corporate policy and covid was the cause. I am so tired of hearing Covid caused this and that it when the issue has nothing to due with the pandemic.A 2 week waiting time to DROP OFF a product for service is absolutely stupid, I understand the service can take some time, but a 2 week wait to DROP IT OFF absolutely STUPID.",0,2

Best Buy,Save yourself a headache and DO NOT…,"Save yourself a headache and DO NOT PURCHASE APPLIANCES from Best Buy. I recently completed a massive home renovation and purchased ALL my appliances for the entire house from Best Buy. I purchased them in late Nov and was told by the staff that it would be no problem to get the appliances delivered when we were ready to install a few months down the road..... WRONG!! It has been a total nightmare. I spent thousands $$$$ as I needed appliances for 2 kitchens and a laundry room. To make a very loooong story short, it took a total of 8 weeks, multiple annoying calls to customer service, and 3 trips by the same delivery guys (eye roll) to actually get them to my house. I even offered to go pick them up myself, but no one could ever seem to be able to locate the appliances- I got several different stories from each person I spoke with. Oh and to top it off, I actually had to choose a different range because apparently they had 'double sold' the one I had already paid for in November. If you have ever done a major home renovation you know how an 8 week wait time can ruin your timeline :( I will no longer be using Best Buy for major purchases that require delivery-- it is not worth the time, money, or stress involved!!",0,1

I took off work both days and not even a call from the delivery service or best buy. They used the covid-19 as an excuse even though they said it was on the delivery truck being delivered both days. The Order Date: 06/25/2020 and it has been two weeks now and still have no REAL delivery date. They originally said it would be delivered in four days.

Best Buy,Don't waste your money or time at Best Buy,"About 8 months ago we bought a Samsung tablet with the extended warranty. Right after we went into lock down my screen got a small crack in it. Since the store was closed I decided to wait to get it fixed so it wouldn't void the warranty. Now they are open so I went to the store without an appointment and was told I would have to wait 30 mins to speak to Geek Squad. So I waited, for almost 3 hrs while other people walked in and went straight to the GS area. When I asked why I was informed that those people had appointments so I would have to wait. I walked out. Today I called to get an appointment and was informed that they would have to send it out to have the screen repaired and it would take 2 - 3 weeks minimum because the Geek Squad who supposedly know how to do their job, are incapable of doing something that a Dish Network tech can do. So, since I use my tablet constantly for my job and everything is on it, I guess I will have to continue to cut my fingers on it or give up the $200 we paid for added coverage. Thank you Best Buy. You have just lost a long time customer.",0,1
Best Buy,"Best Buy Customer Service will lie to you, and do everything they can to keep your hard earned money","On June 24th I purchased a Bosh 500 Series Dishwasher from Best Buy Online. It was supposed to be delivered on July 3rd. When the independent contractor arrived at my home to deliver, and install the appliance it was found that the door had been damaged to the point that it could not be repaired. The contractor agreed to return the appliance to the warehouse, and alert the staff that it was damaged. However, the contractor dumped the returned appliance in an undisclosed location and marked it as ""delivered"". After not receiving any calls from Best Buy to reschedule the delivery. My wife, and I began contacting ""The Geek Squad"" Customer Service as directed by Best Buy's Website. After speaking to many representatives, and having as many as 5 cases opened I am yet to receive my dishwasher (which was payed for in full on June 24th). In sheer desperation I have reached out to my local Best Buy Stores, but they are unable to assist me due to my order being ""an online only order"". During my latest call on July 6th I spoke with the manager of the call center who told me that I would have to wait 36 hours for her to launch an investigation into the issue. I asked if an investigation had been completed in the past, and she admitted that 4 others had been created. She again promised to call me back in 36 hours to update me on the status of my order, and delivery. It is now over 48 hours since I spoke with the call center manager, and I am yet to receive a call, or email from her. I will be ending my long relationship with Best Buy due to this issue, and I suggest that you do the same. Any company that will gladly accept $926 for any item, and deliver it broken does not deserve your business. Not to mention one that will take your $926, deliver the item in unusable condition , and then subsequently refuse to refund your money/deliver a replacement 5 days after the agreed delivery/install date. Word to the wise, DO NOT BUY A THING FROM BEST BUY (online or otherwise). Their customer service is awful, and they WILL take your hard earned money without rendering services or providing the item purchased.",0,1

They said no one was home and then left. I saw all of this on my home security camera but the truck that was delivering the appliance was an enterprise truck so I didn't think to even question it! I was on hold for 2 hours in total after being disconnected twice trying to reschedule. I had scheduled the pickup of the old appliance the day before the new delivery date and no one showed up for that although I have a confirmation email. When I questioned why the appliance wasn't picked up the second time they didn't show up was only that the appointment needed to be rescheduled. No reason as to why they didn't show.. I ordered my appliance from Best Buy because it was in stock and could get it within a few days. It has now been a week and a half and still no appliance. Next time I will order from Home Depot and wait for the product to be in stock. I will probably get it faster. Awful, Awful customer service and delivery!

Best Buy,If I could give 0 stars I would but,"If I could give 0 stars I would but, system requires to choose at least one star. the customer service in Best Buy in Lake Geneva is extremely UN-professional and they are very rude and DIS-respectful towards customers there. Their excuse for being rude and UN-professional that day was that they were (((*SHORT OF HELP*)))!!! Why would that be the customer's problem? There was a guy by the name of Arik who was too busy talking to his friend at the counter to help other customers and then he finally waved me over to ring up my merchandise. As he was waiting for me to fill out my check; he rudely walked away to go talk to his friend again at the opposite end of the counter and left me standing there!!! I said; excuse me; but, that is extremely rude to walk away from a customer in the middle of a sale transaction! Instead of coming back over to apologize and take my check and (((*FINISH WITH MY PURCHASE*))); his friend/customer had to get in on the act and defend his friend/B.B.employee for answering a question for him before he had to leave. Just then a manager (male) comes up behind the desk and heard me then say to the cashier that it is more professional and more polite to finish the sale of (*ONE CUSTOMER*) first; and wait until the transaction is completed before moving on to the next customer; and the manager (""NICK"") ""SCREAMS"" at me that ""It's fine now!"" It's FINE! He is the ""Only One"" up here taking customers and he is helping you ""NOW!"" ""WHAT?!"" I never seen such UN-professionalism and DIS-respect coming from a manager on duty that did not even know what happened (((*BEFORE*))) he even walked up behind the counter but, yet, decided to shout off his mouth at me and try to intimidate me. So, I continued to just deal with the male cashier; Arik, by telling him that next time it would be more professional and business like to finish with (((*ONE customer at a time and to ""FINISH"" with one sale before hoping over to do another one*)))! I was speaking softly and politely when Nick, the manager doing something under the cabinet behind Arik decided to (*BARK*) at me once again and (*INTERUPT*) me by making a comment in a very (*RUDE & INTIMIDATING*) way that (""he is helping you now;"" so ""DROP IT!"") I responded to the manager that I had every right to express why I was upset!!! Because he was helping me when he just merely walked away in the middle of a sale with NO explanation!!! that is when Arik's friend decided to ""once again"" try to put his two cents in and the manager just ""STOOD THERE"" and did nothing to ""STOP"" the rude customer friend from screaming in my face to defend his friend for helping him instead of me!!!! I am certain that this is not the first time these employees have acted this way towards women and females.

(refuse to give full name), saying nothing can do, need to call back again after ""status"" in system change. Questioning why can't process tomorrow since already called, answer is nothing can do because it's not his fault. Asked to speak to supervisor, said he is the supervisor and even their CEO won't even resolve this, because he is the dept. and even I compliant, he is the dept. to handle it. Never ever had anyone that rude and unprofessional.",0,1
Best Buy,wish I could give no star..,"wish I could give no star... Worst customer service. waited 6 weeks for a dishwasher, it was defective! so tech took it back, after already removing my old one and cutting all the lines so he couldn't put it back. The tech broke the casing of my disposal and cut the hose so now I can't use the sink because water pours out from where the hose should be attached and now I have to wait 3 more weeks so I can get a different lower quality dishwasher. And they are not refunding me my total tech support which is only for one year and started in may and I don't even have the product!! I hate best buy never shopping there again",0,1
Best Buy,Wont return GIFT.,"Bought a gift for my husband a month before fathers day, thinking I was ahead of the game and not waiting till the last minutes. Well my husband decided he wanted a gun instead, so I went to return the item which cost me $300 and they said they could not help me because it was outside the 15 day return window. Father's day was after the 15 day window! How would I know he would want something else instead. It was a gift! Last time I shop at Bestbuy. All my Home appliances are from Besbuy, but I guess I'll start shopping at Costco instead.",0,1

Best Buy,Sent my same-day pickup order to a closed store,"I ordered a $150 item same-day pickup. They sent my same-day in-store pickup order to a store that wasn't open, so obviously I couldn't pick it up there same-day. Their online support phone number gave me a runaround and vague answers when I pushed them for specifics on what they were suggesting to resolve it. Having a driver come by and drop it off *sometime* does no good when you can't provide a window of when they'll be there. ""Some time"" is not a valid response when I ordered the drive through a service that stated a one-hour window. The only solution that you offered that you were able to put any guarantee behind was for me to drive an additional 20 miles past the 20 miles I was already going get to a store on the far west end of the Denver Metro area. You guys offered me a $15 credit for the inconvenience of the drive already being late at that point, then needing to spend an extra hour on the road plus wear and tear/gas for driving 40 extra miles, to get what you had already accepted payment for under different terms.Your level one tech was just mindlessly repeating themself ad infinitum without putting any actual thought into what they were saying, then you just left me on hold for 20 minutes when I asked for a supervisor, until I eventually hung up. I tried chatting in to file a complaint and was repeatedly advised to call the CLOSED STORE THAT WAS NOT ANSWERING CALLS to try to get my problem addressed.You guys can't even honor a simple transaction on your website. I bet your company is out of business within the next 5 years.I cancelled the order, I suggest anyone else doing business with Best Buy also cancel their orders and find a competitor. Any competitor can do better than this bumbling mess. I don't care that I had to spend $10 more from your competitor, they got me the item when they said they would.",0,1
Best Buy,I’m extremely disappointed with Best Buy,"I’m extremely disappointed with Best Buy; I bought a IPad for my daughters birthday and had it sent over night for Saturday. Nothing ever showed. I contacted Best Buy twice who told me both times my order would be there. Sunday comes and nothing. I called again and Best Buy said I could be refunded. So I agreed and decided to go purchase another one at the store. I get there and they are sold out, which is fine but they tried to push a “open box” for the SAME exact price I got the new one on sale. They would not honor my sale price if I bought another one while waiting on my refund from the iPad they claimed they lost over night. I sat over an hour while management confirmed “my story” as they put it and I was In fact correct. The actual associates at the store were nice and tried, but they had me deal with headquarters who first, you could barely understand and the manager was extremely rude to me over the phone. The associates at Best Buy were NOT happy with the outcome but could not override corporate. I won’t shop at Best Buy anymore, in August we were going to buy a MAC (Apple) from Best Buy. Unfortunately we will take our business elsewhere because I shouldn't of been treated like I was a criminal trying to pull one over on them, when they verified all my information. I had everything they needed documented and the FedEx carrier confirmed this information plus the Illinois distribution center confirmed it too. Suggestion: treat your customers with respect and not like everyone is out to steal or get something for nothing. If you would of just been honest and said it was a miscommunication between you and the distribution center, I would not be writing this post.",0,1

No one is picking phones inspite of 1 hour plus wait time each times and I actually kept on holding the phone. 4. Delivery of June cancelled abruptly... I was only told we will reschedule (not sure why) 5. On chat for three to four times for over 40 minutes to 1 hours. People just change over and no responses. 6. Now, they give delivery of August ....I cannot wait till August for delivery. I cannot wait for 2.5 months for a simple washer and dryer!!!!!!!!!! How to wash clothes for 2.5 months????? 6. I can't cancel online, I can't talk to anyone, no one responds on chat the moment you say cancel order, and I dont get my delivery..... what to do???????I already got the same washer/dryer from HomeDepot and nicely delivered and installed BUT yet no way to cancel and get my money back from Best Buy!!!Honestly, I don't have time still I spent more than 10 hours reaching Best Buy. If Best Buy cannot deliver why are they taking orders in May? I am so much dismayed that I have to use PayPal's help to to cancel my non delivered order and get back my money. This (PayPal protection of money) is usually for fraudsters and yes, I have to use that to get back my money. PayPal Case ID : PP-D-73575671I assure you I will NEVER EVER AGAIN BUY FROM BEST BUY!

Well Best Buy, it used to be enjoyable doing business with you but lately this is the service I have been receiving, I'll go to Amazon, they are at least closer to their delivery dates, and when I need to reach one of them about this kind of moronic service, I can actually reach someone in less time that I am going to be on hold with you all, 57 minute wait time L M A O.

Best Buy,If only I can rate this no stars,"For about a month I had attempted to buy a laptop from their website and I had paid for express shipping. Throughout the time I waited to receive my package I had not received an email for an order confirmation. The day for the package was scheduled to arrive I still don’t receive any information on the laptop and decided to check online like I usually did to see the update since up to this point it had a status of “Getting Prepared”, turns out the package was delayed and at first I understood because of the COVID so I assume some problems could be realistic to happen at a time like this. So I figure another few days I would get my package....boy I was wrong. Days turned to weeks and with no information about the status of my order, wasn’t able to reach a representative from Customer Service and even worse couldn’t get a refund because they closed that option out for me. Next I go do a little research online and it turns out the laptop was not available to be ordered online because it’s on backorder and the only way to get this laptop was to go to the store. I go to the local BestBuy personally to purchase the laptop and I asked the employee if he can cancel the online order for me since I have been blocked out from canceling since I first purchased online. The employee said he cancelled the order, so I thought I had everything solved. Thought...the next day I see that BestBuy.com decides to all of a sudden ship out the laptop that I just bought from the store, the same laptop I had been waiting patiently weeks for without a single attempt of communication from the retailer. I tried to call customer service to tell them that I cancelled the order in-store the day prior, turns out the employee was clueless and now I can’t even cancel the order with the representative who also seemed like she was a bit clueless. I didn’t had a tracking number and still no confirmation number for the laptop I no longer needed!TL:DR I bought a laptop at store and tried to cancel an online order that was delayed for weeks with lack of commission. Now I’m being double charged for the same laptop.Been going to BestBuy since the late 90’s and I think after this entire encounter, it will be my last doing business with them.

Best Buy,Unfortunately negative numbers are not…,"Unfortunately negative numbers are not available. Try calling Best Buy to talk to a human. Have your finger limbered up to push buttons on your phone to get through. However, it will make little difference. I got a message regarding a 32 minute wait and left my number. I got a call back but no one answered. I called again and went through the same crap but to no avail. Well actually that is not completely true, ""Irving"" came on the line but could only say one thing. Hello my name is Irving how may I help you. Repeated over and over. I personally believe that there is no-one in India by the name of Irving, but who is to say. I spent over an hour of my life waiting to get verification of a billing charge. I am now forced to drive to Chattanooga, TN and hope to be able to verbally interact (I'm sure the word talk is now a forbidden word) with someone there. In my opinion, Best Buy has probably the most complicated and useless telephone assistance at this time in the country. In fact, it is so bad I don't want to buy my next laptop there, or anything else that is too expensive to just toss when there is a problem.",0,1
Best Buy,Worst customer service department ever,"Let me start by saying I am not one to write reviews but I have never had such a bad experience with a company's customer service. I ordered a new tv from best buy on June 8, 2020 and scheduled the delivery for June 13 between 12 and 6 pm. My wife took off work to be there since it needs a signature to be delivered and after waiting around all day, nobody showed up to deliver the tv with no calls or emails saying they wouldn't make it. I log on to my account to see if that can tell me where it is and it says it was delivered even though it never arrived at my house. I called customer service right away to try and get it resolved asap and waited over 2 hours to ever talk to anyone. She told me that she submitted it for review to look into what happened to it and I would hear back in 24 - 48 hours. I wait over 48 hours with no calls so I called them back and waited another hour on hold to talk to someone. They told me that it was dispatched and still waiting to hear back from the delivery company but could not get into contact with the company. I called back every day to try and get it figured out but they tell me the same thing every time. To wait 24 hours, but I never hear back. Best Buy needs to find a better delivery company to use and hire people that know what they're doing. Nobody can actually help you there and every one of them just transfers you to someone else that is clueless and of course you have to hold for a long time and reexplain everything every time. It has been two weeks now and I still don't have my Sony 65"" tv but they were quick to take my $1060. I advise anyone thinking of ordering anything through Best Buy to shop elsewhere because if there is any kind of issue with it they will not be able to help you and will make you jump through hoops to get a resolution.",0,1

I later realized that I still end up paying $170 interest fee even though I paid my account in full over the phone as a One Time Payment to get rid of those extra interest fees. The zero interest fee if paid in full within 6, 18, or 24 months sounds very catchy but it is filled with deceptions that will be revealed once you can no longer return the item you purchased and once Best Buy credit card knows you do not have any other options but to pay everything in full.

I had paid an extra $8 for this expediting shipping, only to see that it will be delivered tomorrow, which is 2 days late. I contacted Customer Support and asked if I could at least get the $8 back since I paid for faster shipping and didn't get it in time and they could not help me at all.

I ended up hanging up after 5 minutes of silence. My fiance called and had the same experience! I tried contacting someone through the chat and i explained my situation....they asked for my information and i saw that they kept typing and deleting what they wrote. Finally after 20 minutes i asked if they planned to answer me (all i wanted to do was reorder my item as I had cancelled it due to it being so late past the delivery date and literally no one could tell me where my item was). They disconnected me from the chat and never got an answer. IVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE IN MY LIFE. Ive never had so much trouble giving a company my money.

Best Buy,First off please institute zero stars…,"First off please institute zero stars as deserved by Best Buy‘s. I just finished reading the reviews wish I had read before I ordered. Obviously the coneheads that manage this business don’t.

Five days later I received another email stating that my order couldn’t be shipped to my address which is a complete lie as I have had many things shipped here UPS FedEx and USPS. In that same email it also stated that it may take up to 10 days for them to return $1047 they are in possession of at this time. My only advice is to stay away from big box stores not only Best Buy’s but Home Depot and Lowes and many others. These operators are using COVID-19 to eliminate the term customer service. you now do not have the ability to call or email to any of these businesses for resolution of a problem. A phone call can easily consume an hour of your time with no results. Please utilize your local merchants as they deserve your business much more than big box stores And they’re under paid employees.Believe me you’ll be money ahead. I see you at the bottom of this page there is a box to check to let Best Buy know about your review this makes me laugh as they would treated the same way as they do their customer service.

Next day comes and no call o email from best buy, I did get a call from a number that I wasn't familiar with and they did not leave a message, they called again 15 minutes later still no message and I called them back, it was the delivery driver who says that he tried to deliver my freezer but because no one was there he rescheduled it, I asked who did he reschedule it with bc it wasn't me, he tells me he put in an order to reschedule and someone would call me. I then call the customer service line (I held on average every time I called about 25 minutes) I spoke to someone and explained everything then she says to hold on and puts me back on hold where I held for another 30 minutes and someone else answers as if this is my first call and I explain again what's going on and get either hung up on or disconnected. I then call back again and speak to a guy who says he sees everything that is going on but he cannot help me because the system isn't updated he tells me I have to wait 24-48 hours. I called the next day and speak to a woman who says it shows your package was delivered, I explained the whole thing and ask her to look in the notes, it wasn't delivered, she tells me she will have to put in a new order but she will call me back in about 20 minutes, I go NO call back.

I received an email from their Senior Specialist Executive Resolutions, Karla Bastida and she did offer a reship and $25.00 discount on the item I ordered. At first I did refuse it with a nasty reply. After talking to friends informing me that UPS was shorthanded with delayed deliveries, I sent her an email asking it the offer still stands that I have changed my mind.

I called them again but this time they told me that they could not give me the full refund after I had been waiting on the line for 2 hours and being transferred to 5 people!!! They even told me that I could leave a bad review, but they will never issue the full refund! Be aware of Best Buy customer service! And their scam auto-renewal subscriptions.

I bought a defective MacBook Pro full price at Best Buy and within first time using it there was an issue with a piece of hardware that was causing display abnormalities.

Then another hardware issue which was causing the screen to glitch out and had to send it in again for repair. At the same time, I had issues with the keyboard again which they ""fixed"". That all happened within the first 12 months of owning this brand new laptop that cost half of my school tuition ($1,500+). Fast forward 2 months later and I am having the same issue with my keyboard. I asked for a replacement because, at this point, this is ridiculous and I shouldn't have these problems and be out of a computer for 7 days at the time. I was on the line with the manager for 1 hour and all he kept repeating was how we could get me set up for a repair when I made it clear I wanted a brand new computer that was not defective since this one clearly is. So now I got to send it in for the 3rd time in 14 months for another repair which will take up to 7 days if not more. I let the manager know that he lost a customer and he showed no care whatsoever.

Best Buy,I purchased 5 LG appliances for my…,I purchased 5 LG appliances for my kitchen. I bought ALL the extended warranties. It was a big chunk of change but I thought it would be a good investment. After only 1 year 3 months my fridge broke. I called Best Buy (waited on hold 2 separate times for over 2.5 hours) and they said I need to call LG because they have extended their manufacturer warranty. So I called them and they want to charge a service fee for coming out and repair fees if they determine that it is not covered on their warranty. UMMMMM NOOO! I already paid Best Buy for a warranty and they should come fix it for no money. I'm beyond upset and I can't get ahold of anyone through phone or email. This company is crooked! Don't buy your appliances from them.,0,1
Best Buy,Must read for laptop buyers!,"Everything is great until I buy the laptop. I bought HP Omen laptop on June 15 which is supposed to arrived on June 20 at Westland, MI location for store pick up per the app/website. On June 20, I got an notification that my order got delayed, and they will cancel and refund my order if I don't get it by June 27. On June 21, I got another notification saying that I need to update my payment within 24 hrs, or the order will be cancelled. I am sure I saw the charge from Best Buy on my credit card on June 15, and saw continuous charges on June 21. My credit card bank didn't approved those new charges because the system thinks it is a fraud. I called the best buy since online chat is unavailable at that moment for some reason. The representative told me that the charge I saw on June 15 was temporary hold which was released(give back) because they are not allowed to hold the payment for more than 5 days. That's why they charge again on June 21. I saw no return charge from June 15 on my c.c. She told me that it was because banks takes several days to clear it up. The rep told me to call my bank and approve the purchase. I know that my bank won't fo that best I have no more credit limit on that card, and the hold charge releasing was also haven't processed it yet. The bank will just told me to wait a few business days for the return charge to post on my card again and purchase again at that time. The only way to proceed is to make a payment with another card which I did online. The order is still not ready on June 22 around 2pm. So, I called elite support again to change the location because the irony is that if I buy that same laptop today, I will get it within 2 business days for free shipping, or tomorrow for a fee. Or I can pick up at other location within an hour. So, I told the rep to change the location which she did. I got an update from the BB app to pick up today and will notify when it is ready. I waited over 3 hrs and arrived to BB an hour before they close at 6 pm. The staffs in the store checked it for me if the laptop is there. Sadly, no even tho the laptop is in stock according to the app when I check it before changing the location. I feel very suspicious so I called the elite support again. The rep there told me that it is because they, for some reason, forgot to approve the payment. I saw everything including payment is fine in my app before, so I believe that it is the human error mistake from BB team like warehouse staff or payment team. The rep makes the call to the warehouse to manually approved the payment and told me that it will be available to pick up by tomorrow, Jun 22, 2020 at most. It has been so much hassle to get this one laptop even when you are paying thousand of dollar with elite status!! I am very very frustrated and disappointed by this experience because this is Covid period, and people need things urgently! I also have to wait in the store for long time before I got my order checked with the reason that it is probably not gonna be available since I don't get email/text confirmation. If I hadn't called the BB rep team, I would have still stucked wondering if I will ever get my laptop. I still haven't got the laptop yet today since the store closes. I will see if I get tomorrow. But I won't get my hope up. I have been buying small things like charger, hard drive, fridge at BB and everything is fine until the laptop experience! Best Buy needs to make up something for this horrible & awful experience! I had bought the ASUS laptop before this HP at BB which is a defective unit and I had to return it.

Best Buy,Best Buy – A Very Bad Idea!,"In my opinion, Best Buy has always provided rather poor service, but now that it has eliminated approximately seventy percent of its workforce, thanks to COVID-19, service is nonexistent.Three years ago my wife and I purchased a complete set of Samsung kitchen appliances from our local Best Buy store and I am currently regretting the purchases. Though they make wonderful televisions, for some reason LG and Samsung can not seem to make decent kitchen appliances. At one point we owned a full set of LG kitchen appliances, which had several design flaws and presented us with numerous issues, and the Samsung appliances we have presently are no better.Fortunately, we purchased extended warranties for all of the Samsung units, but when our dishwasher sprung a leak it took an act of congress to get a service appointment. Even then, Best Buy could not properly coordinate the appointment with the third party contractor that it utilizes for its appliance repairs in our area.In order to even schedule the appointment I had to contact Best Buy’s sales department since there was no one to answer the phones for service. A very nice sales representative told me that the local store only had one remaining Geek Squad tech who was not in at the time of my phone call. She told me that she would leave a message for the tech to return my call and when he did he told me that I would need to call yet another number to schedule the service, given that Geek Squad techs do not service large appliances.This experience has left me to believe that I will now need to shop at Amazon for larger items – possibly even a new car some day – but, no matter what the future holds, especially given all of the changes that are currently taking shape in our society, shopping at Best Buy for anything at this point in time seems to be a very ‘Bad Idea.’",0,1

Best Buy,Worst of Worst,"Worst of Worst! Wow! I wish I read all the bad reviews wrote here, before I expected it myself! I went to the store at Rockville, MD and I was looking for a fridge, I didn't find what we want, but one manager was very nice and found one for us! I purchased it right away, paif for it on a debit card + protection plan + the hose or what needed + the cost for taking away our old fridge! I ordered it Friday, the manager checked with me if 9 am on following Thursday would be good (first delivery available) and I confirmed! Thursday came woke up and took all what we have in our fridge/freezer put them in coolers and containers around 8:30 am thinking they would come around 9! Checked the Email and message gave time window 7 am - 1 pm, then waited...no call no message and all the ice we had was melted and we lost all the food! It was 2PM and nobody showed up, we tried to call on hold waiting time 52 minutes... no human to talk to! I tried to call the nice manager, but went directly to leave a messag and I did! Then I was about to leave to go to the store and as I was leaving I saw track slowing down, so I went to the passenger side because the driver stopped on the road instead on our long driveway. I saw the passenger door opened, I said hello sir, are you here for the fridge delivery?he said yes, and I said finally you arrived, I was just about yo go to the store it was after the time window! The guy immediately said: DO YOU WANT THE FRIDGE OR NOT? and I was surprised how bad attitude he had! And said why do you think we ordered it if we don't want it? And he immediately was going back to his truck and said you were disrespectful and wanted to leave, so I opened the door so he won't leave and I asked him, what did I say that you felt disrespectful!?? Because I asked where were you??? He kept repeating same thing and I said you can't just leave without delivering the fridge! I called my husband to come outside as he didn't know they arrived and missed the scene! And this is not the way you treat a customer. I asked him to call his manager. He called her and I can hear he was telling her I snapped at him?? And was was disrespectful?? And I said I want you to tell me in front of your manager what I did that you felt that? He started to speak not in English and I said, you have to speak English so I can understand what you are saying and then he wanted to hung up and I said I want to talk to your manager! Have her call me, and thankfully she did! She was very understanding and I was making sure to talk in front of him what happened! He started with his colleague taking the fridge down, but he start saying I was lying and while I was still with his manager, he puts the fridge back in the truck and asked his colleague to leave! We really got annoyed for how unprofessional and bad attitude! And I immediately told the manager and she asked me to stay on hold while she can call him. She did and he was lying right before our eyes and told her he is deliver it?! Then she talked to me back and I told her at that point we really were not comfortable having him getting inside our house! He accused me of being disrespectful, lying and wanted to create a situation from nothing because the way he act? And he kept saying if we wanted the fridge? I said we paid fully for it? What this business that you talk like this? The manager said if we are not comfortable, then they can deliver it for us tomorrow same time window and I agreed. She said we will see it on our email at night. So Friday -today - came same thing we woke up early, no word from the Best Buy, we have only few things inside the fridge as we weren't sure when they were supposed to arrive and I got few otems from Giant put in the fridge! We waited waited and pushed work meetings yesterday and today because the delivery.. then it was after 2 no word from them. My husband tried to call the delivery nice manager, she didn't answer! Its all good to be true!!To be contacte-",0,1

Best Buy,Terrible customer service and misleading info at purchase,"I purchased 4 piece kitchen appliance set on May 9th. I was not notified that the refrigerator would be delayed until July 2nd. My first week of purchase my original delivery date was 5/12/20 for all 4 products. I noticed an delivery update email that changed delivery date to 6/29. I immediately phoned best buy and was told I had to wait for system to update 24 hours later and to call back following day. I called following day and still was not able to get answers. I called 3 times the same week with 40 minute hold times at the advice of service reps to try to get sooner delivery date. Finally after calling for two weeks I was given a 6/12/20 delivery date for my microwave, dishwasher, and range. Range arrived damage and I was told by the driver that it had been dropped prior to being placed on truck and item was not level to allow install. I was told I would once again have to phone best buy 1800 number for support. I phone 3 times on 6/12 with 30 minute hold times each time. By the third call I was extremely frustrated because my 3rd party vendor arrived to install dishwasher and it had water in the tub with black smudges on the back of product. It was very clear that it was not a new product. I was told that because it was listed as a open work ticket that the return/exchange of the dishwasher would be be completed for 24 hours. I asked if I needed to phone back in and I was told no I would receive an email. As far as the new stove being delivered I was given a 6/18 delivery date. So I phoned today 6/18 to check status of exchange/refund of the dishwasher and delivery of stove since I was not given an delivery window only to find out that neither order had been put in the system. I purchased the stove due to my old range going out, so her it is over a month later and I still do not have working stove, but have paid for a new one that should have been delivered 5/12. I have a dishwasher sitting in the middle of my kitchen floor with no update of when they will be picking up the used dishwasher that was supposed to be new. I spoke with a supervisor regarding all of my issues since 5/12 and was told a rep was working to fix this issue. I was just emailed a refund of $2.99. What a insult. I will be phoning best buy again today for the second time to notify them that they can cancel the entire order and I will take my business elsewhere. This has been the worst experience and customer service has been terrible. No Rep has put in appropriate notes from previous calls and all I am being told is to keep calling back in. I will never shop at best buy again.",0,1
Best Buy,"Very slow shipping, bad website descriptions, inaccurate delivery estimate, restocking fees","This review is for Best Buy online ordering. Whatever shipping arrangement they have with FedEx and UPS must be for the absolute slowest, most unreliable option there is - slower than traditional ground service. I've ordered five things from Best Buy Online in the last year (four of them pre-COVID) and not one of them arrived anywhere near the estimated delivery date. Some items were as much as a week late. I also received an Intel CPU in a box that looked like it had been run over by a forklift. Not a fun discovery after already having a delayed delivery. Whatever estimated delivery date is listed on the site, just add about a week to that to be safe. If you need something faster, look at Amazon or B&H Photo. They manage to (usually) meet their estimated delivery date.Their return policy on some items is also absurd. I ordered an iPhone and they sent the wrong model. I wanted the SIM-free version but was sent the Verizon version. This matters because Apple won't support LTE signal issues on the Verizon model if you aren't using Verizon even though the phone can technically use any carrier. Thus why Apple suggests ordering the SIM-free model if you use an MVNO carrier such as Cricket, Ting, Total Wireless or Visible. Because I opened the phone before noticing this (the Verizon SIM preinstalled gave it away), I was charged a $45 restocking fee and had to pay return shipping even though the mistake was theirs. They don't stand behind their promises and have a lot to learn from other companies who are doing online ordering right.",0,1

I call UPS, USPS and Best Buy and am not given the option to provide address information. Best Buy expects me to wait until the item is sent back to the store and re-order the item. Why, so it can be delayed & never arrive again? Yeah right! I’ll be purchasing directly from the manufacturer, which guarantees 2-day shipping. I should’ve ordered from them originally.

The machine has a factory defect and after 2 repairs from Samsung the refrigerator has been deemed ""Unrepairable"". It is technically out of warranty. I've called and chatted with Best Buy Customer Service to no avail. It's not OK for a $1500.00 Refrigerator to last 5 years? They should at least stand up to Samsung rather than turn their back on people. Samsung refrigerators have known defects and Best Buy still sells them.",0,1
Best Buy,"Best Buy going the way of Circuit City - Lousy execution of service agreements, and Customer Service.","In March of this year, we purchased a washer and drier. We chose Best Buy due to the Free Set up and Delivery. Because of ""COVID"" they said they had to just dump it in the garage, and good luck. Then in April I purchased a Cannon TR8250 Printer. Today (June 16th) is is not working correctly. I took out the service agreement when I purchased it. I called to make an appointment to get it serviced. The Geek Squad said I had to do it on line. I tried for 2 hours to get to talk to someone (no talk, on line chat). Then when I finally did, they gave me advice that I had already gotten from the Cannon web site. He told me I could just take it to the store. I told him I was told I needed an appointment. Then they made an appointment. I thought it was for 4:20 today. Turned out it is for 4:20 on June 23. So now even with the service agreement, I am without a printer for a week. That is considering they will even be able to fix it, and how long will that take? When I realized it was for 6/23, I thought i would take it to the store. They told me that there were no appointments until that time. So I asked if I could just leave it? They said I would need to wait until the 23rd. They really push the warranty when selling, but they are pretty bad when it comes to execution. Come on BB, you can only blame your lousy customer service on COVID for so long, it gets a bit tiresome after a while. You are that backed up and we are in a 20% unemployment situation. Hire some unemployed folks to supplement your work force until you get caught up.",0,1

Best Buy,Awful customer service for Best Buy…,"Beyond awful customer service for Best BuyWe bought a microwave a month ago, paid to have it installed. Because of Covid19, we let the installer do it without supervision. He called us from his car as he left and said there was a defect--a scratch on the handle, and let him know if it wasn't acceptable, and they would take care of it. Well it was a wide and obtrusive scratch on the handle and looked horrible. We wanted it replaced. But BestBuy customer service has been HORRIBLE, stalled us, beyond the return period. The manager who was supposed to call me about it, never did. The number the installer gave me for him seems to only have a generic message (no name or store name), and my calls never got returned.When I left him a message and threatened to call the credit card company to contest the charges, they called and said they'd order a new handle, but it would take two weeks. Two or a bit more weeks later, the service was scheduled, and the service guy (third party) called and asked us if we had the part. No, BB ordered it, we assumed he had it. He said normally they would send it to us, which they didn't. Also, he said it was listed as a CUSTOMER PAID replacement. We would need to pay to have it replaced, even if we had it.We are very unhappy, and will NEVER EVER buy from Best Buy again. I suggest you look elsewhere as well.",0,1

When I took it out of the box I found it had a big bump in a corner. Possibly during shipping. Getting in touch with customer service is a nightmare. Every time you call the waiting times are over one and a half hours. If you try to chat online, it kicks you out because the systems are busy. They have no customer service email. When I finally made contact, they wanted me to take the freezer to the distribution center, over one hour away. They would not send a delivery truck to pick it up and send a replacement. Feeling so desperate and helpless, I sent an email to the CEO, VP of Operations and VP of Customer Experience. None of them ever responded and nobody contacted. Now I have to get a truck and drive over an hour each way to the distribution center to return the damaged freezer. Never thought anything like this would happen to me.

Best Buy,Best Buy deliver damaged goods and forcing an upsale,"Venting here, and preparing to write letter to the BBB.Sadly it seems as if best buy is now a dishonest seller and warranty store.Our previous dishwasher failed, sprang a leak. We went to best buy and purchased a Bosch 300 series, new cash. They delivered a couple weeks later. the delivery service left it wrapped on our deck. I placed two tarps over it, one plastic, one heavy canvas. No reason to allow damage to a new machine.I worked on repairing/replacing our kitchen floor. I had reached the point to connect the Bosch supplied electrical system. I took off the cardboard cover, the plastic wrap, and found a large dent right rear top corner. I looked inside the dishwasher and the dent protruded inside and made it difficult to open the top rack.I took pictures, printed, called the 800 number that best buy had provided. I was put on hold, the recording stated i f I put my number in they would call back with the estimated 32 minute hold time. I did. I was called back 35 minutes later and put on hold. The hold rang, told me I was still on hold. 35 minutes I was still on hold. I hung up and we went to best buy.The appliance salesman worked with us. He said he would call as soon as he spoke to the department.We went home, he called an hour later and told me what a great deal he had for me. The 300 series we wanted would probably never be in stock, but if I pay the difference he will sell me the 500 series display model. Already saw it, the display is missing the install components, the silverware rack and tray. My wife does not want the 50 series.Then he tells me it is the only thing available and I have to pay the difference or they will not replace the damaged dishwasher. SO I ask him this, If you purchase a car cash money, it is delivered, the seats don't match, it doesn't run, but the salesman tells you all you have to do is pay the difference for the more expensive model, that you don't want, then you will have a great exchange and see how good it is.He told me I shouldn't put it like that, I asked him how I should put it.So now, I have to return the damaged unusable dishwasher to best buy, I do not own a truck, that they delivered before best buy will even consider returning our cash money, if they have it. The upsalesman will not say when they will pick it up, or if they will. He wants me to buy a truck? We might have to wait until they have the money.",0,1

I ordered a birthday present for my daughter during the pandemic that was not what she wanted. Due to stores not being open, I waited three weeks to return the product when the stores reopened in my state. They refused to accept the return or the exchange because it’s past their 14 day policy. I can’t even get a store credit. They are completely inflexible. What major company has such a restrictive return policy? It’s basically like they don’t have one.

Best Buy,Bait and switch again!!!,"I sat at my computer for five minutes trying to circumvent the system...like I wanted to leave NO stars...zero, zilch, nada. I am steaming, more than furious with Best Buy and myself. I vowed years ago when they charged me a ridiculous restocking fee that I would never buy from them again. I did and I am sorry.I went online to buy the video doorbell The Ring. After reading many reviews and comparing prices I decided to wait for the third generation ring which was advertised to come out on June 3rd. The Second generation was $99.00. The third was also $99.00. It was the same price as the second-generation. Wanting the newest version with a removable battery I decided to pre-order and wait for the debut of the third generation. Also, I thought $99.00 was some sort of promotion to wait for the few weeks until the third generation was released. In the interim, the Chime which was sold separately was $29.99 so I ordered that day and waited for The Ring to arrive. It just arrived.As I have problems with my hands I hired someone to install the Ring. While they were busy I sat and read the box. It stated clear as day under contents...2nd generation. I went through all of the specs checked everything and, thinking it was an honest mistake, I called Best Buy and related this story to them. I was told I probably selected the wrong one, it was not possible that THEY had made that error and that I ordered that Ring.OK if 2nd and 3rd generation were the same price and the same quality why would I wait for the third generation....because it's an upgrade and they said I could pre-order. Jump ahead to my interaction with Best Buy. Yes, I could take back everything and get the third generation but I would have to pay the price of $149.00. Of course, I balked at that suggestion as, in my opinion, it was their error. She refused to budge, said bring it back pay the rest of the money but they did NOT have the third generation in stock. So, I asked...""Is that why they sent me the second generation?"" We were NOT friends by then. I asked for The Ring's corporate number to verify the difference in the editions (there is), the date the third generation was released (I was right) and should I just accept the one I received because they refused to bend. The young man I spoke to agreed with me said he saw some glaring problems from what I related to him and he would go there and get my third generation when it came in and not pay any more money.I decided to forget the money, forget their shady corrupt bait and switch tactics and never shop there again and do my best to turn the whole Geek world against them. So, I have to go so that I can put my review on all of the other review sites. Best Buy is probably the worst store I have ever dealt with. Stay away...even if they are the cheapest...you'll get screwed over in the end.",0,1

The webpage just says it's getting ready, the same thing it has said since I ordered it. Since I couldn't reach them by phone, I called a local store and was told they dont really answer those phones anymore and they have moved to chat. So I try chatting and the 1st person was not able to help so they got a supervisor involved. He basically said that I need to return it once it gets delivered and he couldn't cancel it before it shipped. Best Buy customer service is a joke and I will not do business with them anymore.

So the next day I call again, wait on hold almost an hour again. This time I'm told they are waiting on the manufacturer and I'll have to call back again tomorrow... So now after being on hold for over 4 hours, I have no new dishwasher, no old dishwasher, no estimate on when I'll see my new one, and a gaping hole in my cupboard with loose wires and tubes hanging out. O and I just had to make the first payment on an appliance I DO NOT HAVE!! This is absurd! No one I've talked to has been able to give me any idea of when I'll receive the product that I ordered! I will never but a single thing from this terrible company again!",0,1
Best Buy,I am so disappointed in Best Buy and…,"I am so disappointed in Best Buy and the geek squad help line. After purchasing a Refrigerator (NOT CHEAP) I have waited for two six hour delivery windows. NOT COMPLETED. When I purchased the refrigerator the salesperson explained that I would have wait for a 4 man delivery team. Waited for 1st delivery. NO 4 man team, NO phone call to reschedule , NOTHING FROM BEST BUY. Call number (no chance that if they screwed up they would call me?) wait on hold for 40 minutes and the smug geek squad guys explained that the salesperson screwed up and they would need to re schedule. 2nd appointment window 12 to 6 pm . At 4 pm I call wait 30 minutes on hold , no show on the delivery again they explain the SAME THING need a 4 man team and even though the paper work shows it needs a 4 man team they only sent 2 so THEY DO NOT SHOW UP –DO NOT CALL –??. Now I have to call back to schedule another appointment. They have made me sit at home twice now for two 6 hour windows and they cannot even give me a phone # to bypass the 30-40 minute wait on hold ??I would expect at least a phone call with someone trying to make this right. NOTHING !! I am now sitting on hold AGAIN 6 hour delivery window x 2 and now getting close to 2 hours on hold phone calls waiting on hold. Very disappointed and would not ever recommend anyone use them for anything.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy store is a rip off,"Best Buy store is a rip off. Their customer service is non existent. They do not honor their price match offer. My item arrived one week later than promised. Then on top of that, their internet price went down $20 before my item arrived. When I called Best Buy to get my $20 price match guarantee... They would not pay the reduced price as advertised on the same company website I originally used to order the product. I'll not shop at Best Buy again. Deceitful store with deceitful policies.....",0,1
Best Buy,I purchased a stove,"I purchased a stove, had it delivered, and installed by Best Buy approximately 2 yrs ago (2018). As of yesterday it stopped working. No error codes no nothing. I pulled back panel off and one of the 3 wires attached for the power cord was burnt crumbled in half. I had an electrician come out to take a look, and was informed that this is not cause of faulty appliance, nor wiring. This was caused by poor workmanship on the installers. They had not tightened down the wire properly causing some sort of arch which then in turn caused it to burn down to a chard black powder. I promptly called Best buy, recording advised I was to expect 18min hold time, I gave up after an hour and a half. Today I called yet again I was informed I would be on a 22min hold. I am 3hr 53min into this call. One gentleman answered for less than 5 min. Said he would have to place me on hold for another 2-3 min to see what could be done. That was 45min ago. I understand short staffing due to Covid-19, however this is unacceptable. Again this is not a warranty issue, this is an installation issue. I am still on hold as I type. There is no way to email them on their website. The live chat ""to busy"" try later, and the phone call i am stuck waiting for some resolution going on 4hrs. I have been a loyal customer for years, and have never had such a disappointing experience. After 4hr and 18min the woman on the phone asked if I had my receipt while i was looking, it sounded as though I was on mute. Then she hung up.",0,1

Furthermore, the money will not be returned for up to 30 day billing cycle so I cannot afford to buy another one for my birthday. I have been a loyal customer for OVER 20 years and I feel this was a terrible handling of customer loyalty, money and product transfer. Insurance will pay for their losses.

Point is I should not have to guess, I should have been sent an e-mail receipt when charged. A phone call to Best Buy gave me the COVID-19 excuse and ended up hanging up. I went online and there was that COVID-19 excuse again. Told there was a very long wait time to talk to a person and I should use the online web site. Wonder if they knew that was where I just came from. I hope I get better service when I drive 40 miles to the nearest Best Buy store. I am sure I will not do any buying!",0,1

I contacted the Best Buy customer services several times during this CoVid-19 stay-home order period to discuss alternative ways for non-members to return product(s) as none of the local NYC stores are open yet. Their final response was 'no' and I was suggested that I should return the product at the nearest store (located in another state) that accepts the in-store returns. Clearly, Best Buy are not concerned about their customers' health, safety and well-being during this pandemic. Very disappointed.",0,1

Best Buy,"Very poor delivery service, cancel on me same day and reschedule after 16 days","I ordered a Samsung washer almost three weeks ago. It was scheduled to be delivered today 5/30/20 between 7am to 1pm. I waited all that time with no one showing up. I tried to call to inquire about my delivery, unfortunately wait time is over 3 hrs. I tried to chat with an agent and also wait time is over 50 min. I then received an email informing me that my delivery was cancelled and that I have to reschedule it, they provided a link for reschedule. First appointment available is June 16th, i.e. I have to wait another 16 days without a washer. This is really poor service and a nuisance to wait close to 6 weeks for a delivery.",0,1
Best Buy,2020 and Incapable of Handling E-commerce,"I really can't recall the last time I've had SUCH a terrible experience placing an order with any retailer, so much so that I sought out a place to post a review. I placed an order with some freshly issued e-gift cards and a credit card. Moments after the order was accepted, I received an email stating there was an issue with the payment. The link in the email to correct the issue led to a page that didn't exist. Checking the order manually, everything looked fine though the credit card was listed as Awaiting Authorization. The next morning one gift card showed Authorization Failed. Why does Best Buy not validate payment details before the order is accepted and completes the checkout process?I started a chat with a rep from Best Buy's website, and after waiting half an hour, I was told chat reps can't assist with payment issues. Okay, odd and irritating, but why not filter these out before connecting, or mention that on the website? After calling the number provided by the chat rep, waiting for a call back, re-explaining my issue and being placed on hold at least 3 times, I was told that I didn't call the right number. I was transferred to another rep and waited in another queue, re-explained my issue again, was placed on multiple more holds, and was told the gift card failed to authorize. I explained that was indeed why I called and instructed that rep to check what order the balance had been applied to. She responded the full balance was applied to the order in question. As confused as I was, she explained that the gift card should automatically reprocess overnight, followed by the credit card. Skeptical, I explained that in the email I received, it stated that the order would be canceled if payment wasn't resolved the same day. She assured me there was nothing to worry about and the order would sort itself out, implying there wasn't anything she could do anyway.The next morning, as expected, I woke up to a canceled order for an item that is now out of stock. In addition to this canceled order, funds for the failed gift card were not returned. Based on the briefest of web searches, I was able to find HUNDREDS of posts from people previously in the same situation as me, going back YEARS. Why has this common issue not been resolved if it has existed since at least 2016?Following up with now a FOURTH support rep and explaining my frustration with the whole process, I was told that even though funds for one gift card were returned immediately, the failed gift card might take longer to process and to call back later if the funds aren't returned. At this point, I'm left seething and livid. Should I have to contact at least FIVE SEPARATE SUPPORT REPS and expend multiple hours of effort in order to place a single order, due in full to multiple failures on Best Buy's behalf?Most of the reps I spoke to seemed to provide their best level of assistance and I understand that problems happen, but clearly Best Buy has no interest in resolving them in a satisfactory manner. Best Buy's support reps are either ill-equipped with inadequate systems, overwhelmed by the number of requests, inexperienced, or simply don't care (likely due to a combination of the other potential issues).Having worked in numerous customer service roles myself, up into management, the glaring incompetence displayed here on multiple levels has solidified the fact that I should never purchase any items from Best Buy in the future and disparage friends and family from doing so. Granted, those with whom I've spoken were surprised I even bothered to try shopping with Best Buy in the first place.Best Buy has been providing an online shopping experience for decades, and at this point, issues such as mine should be inexcusable; simply no longer existing or being resolved on a first-contact basis. Should Best Buy fail to stave off domination from other online retailers, it won't be because of actions from those retailers, rather the inaction of Best Buy.",0,1

So lesson learned, DO NOT purchase the extended warranty Best Buy offers, it's only for minor hardware. So I called a local computer repair business and they got my laptop in and out in 24 hours.

Best Buy,Incredibly difficult to get Customer Support from BB these days.,"Until recently, I was a fan of Best Buy, spending hundred or thousands of dollars each year. Their phone service was weak, but in person, the store staff was always helpful. However, their COVID business policy, especially now at the end of May, is ludicrously terrible for customer service/support! Unlike their competitors, we still cannot enter a store in person (without an ""appointment""), and we essentially cannot talk to anyone who is capable of assisting us with online purchase, delivery, or technical issues. Their phone support is absolutely TERRIBLE -- both for regular Best Buy support -AND- for Geek Squad support. Yesterday I purchased an ""Open Box"" Refrigerator from a nearby store, hoping to take advantage of their free delivery policy. The web site would not allow me any option other than ""store pick-up"", even though a store employee told me they would deliver if I requested it. I called Best Buy Customer Support and waited over 1.5 hrs to speak to someone, only to be told he couldn't help me. He forwarded to Geek Squad (appliance delivery), where I waited another 2 hours on hold. When a GS rep finally answered, he seemed sympathetic, but he had to investigate. ""Just hold on for 5 minutes."" He NEVER got back on the phone with me!!! I waited on hold another hour, before giving up. Lastly, I tried calling the store again. I waited on hold 15 minutes. Then somebody picked up and immediately hung up on me. I cannot deal with a franchise that will not provide any communication/support to their customers! I canceled the order. I will not return to Best Buy for any big ticket purchases.",0,1
Best Buy,Update,"Update: I just filed a complaint with the Attorney General's office. I told the supervisor at Best But that when they go out of business, do not blme amazon or online shopping. BLAME YOURSELVES!! They sad just pay the $16 and it's done with. I told them that's extortion. I never received a product, I never authorized their charge, they credited $61 of the unauthorized charge, but it's UNAUTHORIZED. No product, no consent. Just BB saying ""Give us $16."" For nothing! That's because they can't make their money legitimately so they have to extort it from their customers. PLEASE file with the AG's office. I intend to direct them to the reviews here so they can see the pattern. Honestly, I can't wait until BB goes out of business.

No matter which shipping carrier you use to deliver your products, nothing can prevent those inevitable bumps or accidental drops as something gets transported from Point A to Point B so you will need to bubble wrap. You risk spending a little more time to bubble wraps, will result in more customer returns and product replacements due to damaged goods and losing valuable customer loyalty. I'm very disappointed in you Best Buy that you knew better to pack people purchased better than just throwing inside a box without any bubble wraps for protections!

Best Buy,"Wow, so bad, there are no words.","Wow, wow wow, Best Buy just does not want to stay in business. Over the past month I've tried to order a number of things from the website to be both delivered and picked up at the store and the items never arrive. Due to porch pirates, I have things delivered to my UPS Store where I have a box. The first order they said it couldn't be delivered there, so I chose to have it go to the store so I could pick it up. The small item was there but the other item, the one I really needed, was delayed. They couldn't say for how long, they didn't know where it was or how to track it down, just that it wasn't there. So I didn't bother picking up the smaller item and never heard back from them about the larger one.A couple of weeks later I figured I'd give them another try so I ordered a camera battery. For some reason, picking up at the store was not an option but I could have it shipped. Why it couldn't be shipped to the store for pick up is anyone's guess. But still, they would not deliver to my UPS box when I put in the #. What is interesting though, is that they have Access Points where you can have items delivered for pick up and guess what? My UPS Store happens to be one of those places!! How is that possible? Was it the box # that was throwing the system off? Who knows, but I chose that as the place to have the battery delivered.More than a week later, and of course after hours so I can't call them back, they call me to say they can't deliver to the address because it needs a box #. HUH? WTAF? When I tried putting in a box # they couldn't deliver it, and when I choose it as an Access Point from their own website which states that you don't need a box to have it delivered there they are asking for a box #. When I got them on the phone he said the system wouldn't allow them to change anything and they couldn't even cancel the order, so there is the battery, sitting at the store ready to ship but they can't ship it to an address THEY SUPPLIED!!!!He then told me that I could cancel the order and reorder it to be shipped to my local BB store, which is odd because it wouldn't let me do that before, but whatever. But I'd have to use the Help button on the site or call customer service to cancel the order. He was actually very nice and helpful. When I contacted customer service they said they couldn't cancel the order but guaranteed it would be here today. Well, it's today and the site still says it is delayed. The people in the chat window say there is nothing they can do and that the order can't be canceled and keep ending the chat when I ask them if they have any idea where it is or when it will be delivered. Seriously, I'd be surprised if this company doesn't file for bankruptcy before the end of the year.",0,1

On the morning of the delivery, they called to complain and the manager of the Indianapolis office hung up on us with no delivery date arranged. We then called the Bloomington store and spoke to managerwho assured that someone would call us the next day to arrange delivery on that day. We called the store and they had no idea if when it could be delivered. He became upset when we complained about the service. He was relieved when we suggested cancelling the order.

We are now 1 day before the product is supposed to be to me with this revised date and this still has yet to be shipped out. If an order is back ordered or special product this should be advertised . This should be made aware so the shopper can go else where if not. You take my money and then process the order further with no acknowledgement from the customer and here the customer is inconvenienced with a order that does not appear to be moving at all. You would think from a customer service perspective if a customer Calls in numerous times in regards the company would reach out to the manufacturer to see what the status is.

The manager is Michelle.This is so frustrating for a first time apartment owner.",0,1

Best Buy,AWFUL Customer Service,"I posted on the customer support forums trying to get my money back for expedited shipping due to a shipping delay, and instead of acknowledging me and helping me, they simply deleted my post. TWICE! I asked for a refund of 20 dollars, that's all. Nothing more. Should be simple. Nope! The only reason I went to the forums was to try and free up call space, but I guess I'm going to HAVE to call! Amazing. Why even have a customer support forum? I'm not shopping here again. The very first time I had an issue with this company, and this is the service I get? We are going to pay off our card, cancel it, and never, ever shop here again.",0,1
Best Buy,I just visited US for a business trip…,I just visited US for a business trip excited to get LTE unlocked Samsung Galaxy smart watch. They are totally unprofessionals and unreliable retelers since they are misguiding the customers. Although I have show them the model number and I show them the picture.. Upon my return I realise at the box of the watch is written a different model. I paid 299$ and I don't even know if the one they gave me cost this much or I can have the same features exactly with the one was my choice. It is honestly big dissapointment and I can't believe at the receipt they gave me they put the model of the watch I requested them but they gave me different one. They are not trustworthy and they do not deserve ti have people preference when it comes to electronics shopping. I will make sure to write an official complaint towards Samsung for allowing them to misguide consumers and not properly representing the Samsung products.,0,1

Best Buy,Customer service not empowered t fix issues.,"Placed an order for a computer on a Friday, noticed the same day that when I clicked on my email address the auto complete changed the already filled in address to the one I moved from last month. I went to there web page and tried to correct this issue, however the option was locked out. So I contacted a customer service agent, spent about 40 minutes with him as he tried to correct the problem, then he asked me when I placed the order. When I told him it was about 2.5 hours ago he told me they could not fix it the day it was ordered and had to try again in a day or two. I contacted another agent the next day and spent another 10 minutes and he said they could not fix until it shipped. (That would be a day I was scheduled to work, so I now had to find a way to trade shifts with some one so I would have time to deal with this) I then got a hold of another agent on Tuesday when it was in transit so he could attempt to do an intercept. He told me it was done after another 45 minutes with him and a 2 hour wait time. UPS attempted to deliever the package to the uncorrected address when that failed it was returned. According to UPS tracking the shipping label was not printed until Monday. So correcting the shipping address Friday, Saturday or Sunday should have been easy as updating the information in the system it would have been a simple thing that would have minimal expense on Best buys part. If they would allow customers to fix issues like this up until the shipping label was printed I could have fixed it myself with no cost to them. If they had empowered their customer service agents with the ability to fix issues like this before the shipping tag was made it could have been fixed with minimal expense. Instead I am now waiting for them to to get the item back and refund my money and despite having purchased computers from them in store in the past I am now boycotting them from all future purchases. All because they do not empower their customer service agents to fix issues before the shipping label is printed.",0,1

Best Buy,They lost a customer.,"I just carefully chose computer components and accessories at Best Buy, and arranged for some to be shipped to me, while others would be picked up by my husband when ready -- a week and two days. I was dumped out of the system while typing for taking too long. But I had to hand enter my husband's every time for the pickup at store option. Of course it took forever!Worse, I set up the account using my email, and I created the password, and it's my phone on the account, and the shipping is to me, personally. But because his name was on the credit card used ... the account switched to his name instead. When I called the customer service number, after listening through a bunch of fluff, they told me their customer service line was closed and to go to their website. I did that the first ten times I tried to fix the account name; nothing helpful there.",0,1
Best Buy,Beware BEST BUY Customers!,"Beware BEST BUY Customers!I purchased an LG front loader, LG dryer and two pedestals on March 15th. The customer service that I experienced in the store was excellent and Mr. Ernest G. was very helpful. I had to wait for my order due to Covid-19. No problem. I received email on April 23 that I can now call to reschedule delivery appointment as Best Buy has started back making deliveries. My first delivery attempt was on April 30th between 7am and 1pm. One of the guys came in to check to see where the appliances were going. I decided to go outside to see what they were doing. I notice that both the washer and dryer were on its top. I told one of the guys that they were not to turn the appliances on its head. The guy said it has bolts in it. I let him know that after he install the appliances and something goes wrong he wont be anywhere around nor would he be paying the bill. I told them again that is not how the pedestals are to be installed to the LG washer and dryer. I politely told them they could leave it on the truck and take it back and that I would be calling Best Buy. Before I called Best Buy I placed a call to LG customer service. I ask if at any time was it okay to have the washer and dryer on it’s top. The gentleman said, “No, absolutely not. That is not how the appliances are to be installed. “I called Best Buy and told them what happen and asked that they not send the same guys back out. I was told I would have to call back the next day to get order rescheduled. I did just that and was able to set up delivery for May 8th. Now that I know some of the delivery guys like to take short cuts, I go down to meet them and ask if they know how the pedestals are to be installed properly. The guy said yes. He goes on to say there is a washer and 2 pedestals. I told the gentlemen that there was a dryer with my order. They checked and said there is no dryer. I’m thinking to myself what good is a washer when there is no dryer. I again call Best Buy and was told its showing in cart so they would have to wait till tomorrow and asked me to call back. I call back on May 9th and explained the situation and the guy said he would call me back that evening. I wanted him to know how frustrated I was and that the appliances cost more than a penny and the pedestal were $279 for each. The guy stated again that he would call me back and that he would send out a gift card for my troubles. The evening came and went. On May 11th I placed a total of 3 calls to Best Buy for total hold time of 56 minutes and no one came to the phone. Since I put the purchase on Amex I called them and asked for reverse in charges. I explain what happened and at this point I would like Best Buy to come and get their washer and two pedestals. As of May 18 I heard nothing from Best Buy but when Amex reversed the charge on May 19th the same day I get a email from Best Buy to call and reschedule delivery. I called and let the lady know that they need to set up a day and time for them to come out and pick up what they dropped off. Of course I was on hold for a long time. After she gave me a day and time I asked to speak with a manger, she said okay I will bring one on the line. At this point I’m 52 minutes into this call and what did they do... They showed their customer service skills and hung up on me.I decided to post my experience instead of perhaps inconveniencing them when they come to pick up their load and not be home cause I’m at HOME DEPOT getting my washer, dryer and pedestals.Sent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphoneSent from my Galaxy Tab® S2",0,1
Best Buy,A cruel kick in the teeth - I will never buy anything from Best Buy again.,"I applied for a Best Buy Citi credit card in September 2019, and I was approved, after which I bought a TV and cables from them on that card.All of my due payments thereafter were made on time, and last week I completely cleared my balance (it was over $300 that was still owed).I hadn't been planning to make any further purchases, especially given the present situation due to COVID.As a pat on the back, and with outstanding sensitivity and a knack for retaining customer loyalty (yes I'm being EXTREMELY sarcastic), I was sent a note today saying that my account had been terminated due to my credit score?My credit score was WORSE when I originally applied for credit, another issue I have is that I have only recently moved back to the USA after being away for many years and have been working hard to build my score. This was a very unnecessary gesture and NOBODY at Best Buy's customer service could help or give me a reasonable explanation, other than reading from the letter that I had also received, and already read.This will have un-necessary and avoidable negative impact on my credit score, and I would have expected greater sensitivity and understanding in this matter.I will be disputing this to the fullest extent possible. Absolutely appalling on ""Best"" Buy's behalf. I appreciate that they will probably have implemented measures in order to mitigate losses and credit vulnerability in the face of an impending recession, but alienating and punishing patrons who have used credit responsibly hardly seems the right way ahead. I will certainly never do business with them again.",0,1

We picked a TV on wed and we were promised delivery on Fri May 15 between 7 am until 11 am. I got up early and did a good covid cleaning to protect the delivery people. Then I waited and waited. I drove over there and was told delivery was on June 12th!!! ( It was written on the paper work but I just took the salesman’s word). I drove back over there and asked for a refund. When I got home my husband told me that they had not refunded for the Geek Squad and delivery. So I had to go back AGAIN. My husband and I finally got a wonderful TV at Sams Club. We saved 500.00. And will never return to Best Buy. I would rate them a zero if I could.,0,1

The second tv did the same thing. When I went to the Best Buy in Independence the manager, Stephanie, offered to have the tv shipped to the store so she could test it herself and call me to either pick it up, or choose another tv if it did not work. She called saying she received my tv, would check it and call back. When she didn't call back I called myself only to wait on hold for fifteen minutes and then be told they lost my tv. They said they hoped I picked my tv up because they no longer had it and must have given it to someone else.

No package revieved, called several times on 12th- no customer service available to take call. Called my local post office because USPS is also not taking customer calls. Advised that package had only been scanned upon pick up. All the other info on USPS tracking was bogus. Stated that for over a month deliveries that pass through MIchigan have been "" hung up"" many times for weeks on end. Best Buy was aware of this when they sold the item and falsely guaranteed delivery by a specific date. Today, May 13th, I recieved another email stating in BOLD LETTERS that my package was arriving early on May 11th?? Further down the page it said delayed until USPS provides another delivery date! Really? I tried to click on cancel and get refund but it was greyed out. Clicked on ? More information only to get a message that it was past cancelation date and could only be refunded after delivery. What a messed up company. NEVER TRUST AGAIN.",0,1

I wait another hour in chat, I explain everything to the rep and tell him I would like a replacement. He says it’s scheduled to be delivered tomorrow 05/12. I tell him OnTrac has been saying that for almost a week. He gives me an auto response and ends the chat. Great to waste over an hour of my time and now I get to do it all over again tomorrow. Thanks Best Buy.05/12Came into chat again for the third time. Let the rep know what was going on and asked if I could have a replacement sent out. He checked the tracking and said it’s out for delivery today. Let him know it has been saying this for the past 6 days.

Best Buy,Best Buy GM treats customers like criminals...,"I wasn't sure if Best Buy was open but in an effort to try and do business with them instead of Amazon..I swung by to see. There were tents and a line with a few people so I walked up not knowing what the procedure was so I attempted to inquire. I was told to get in line to which I said ""what is the procedure? Can I go into the store or how does it work"". This big guy...the general manager it turns out named John came storming over...through out his arm and pointed telling me ""get in line like everyone else"". I said that I wasn't cutting line that I was trying to find out what the situation was to decide if I wanted to stand in line. He informed me later that I had to get in line and then he'd tell me what the procedure was. How outrageous! It was like dealing with the German gestapo...he was arrogant and acted like I was a criminal or had broken some law. In my entire life I have never been treated with such animosity while trying to business with a store. I walked back up and asked a young man to speak to the manager and he informed me that the guy who just treated me like a criminal was the GM. Then this John came walking over...arrogant and said something to the effect...Oh look who's back. Does Best Buy approve or endorse this kind of gestapo behavior? Unbelievable....and until I know what your attitude is about this type of behavior from a GM I will never buy a thing from BB again.",0,1
Best Buy,Worst Customer Service,"I ordered a full appliance set from here, they shipped me 2 of the products immediately, and had the rest scheduled for delivery. My delivery date was a month out and I had a date scheduled. The day before delivery, I had gotten rid of all the old appliances to make space I was never contacted about approximately what time the delivery should arrive so I contacted customer service chat and the rep guaranteed me that it would be coming tomorrow. I waited for 6 hours and no one showed up. I then called in and the rep told me again that it was on the way and she would call the delivery truck and call me back. Never called me back so I called in again. It takes about an hour to get through to a rep or for a call back. When I finally reached someone, they told me that they had an error in their system vs the delivery system and my delivery would not come for a week. This was their fault and they were not willing to make and reparations other than a $100 gift card! I had no appliances to make food I asked for $100 credit per day that I had to wait so I could buy food due to their mess up and they were unwilling to do anything. I was so fed up I cancelled the order and ordered from Home Depot instead. They had originally sent me a gift with purchase and did not tell me that I needed to return it or else I would get charged for the full price. A week later, I saw the charge show up so I contacted CS once again and they would not take the item back or refund my money since it was out of their 2-week return window. How am I supposed to return and item that you sent out a month before the rest of the delivery if the return window is 2 weeks???? The customer service team is rude and condescending and they avoid any direct question you ask them and just apologize for nothing. It is so frustrating talking to anyone in their CS department because they will try their hardest to put the blame on you and have no resolutions for anything they just constantly apologize even when you explicitly tell them not to.

Best Buy,TERRIBLE isn't a strong enough word to…,"TERRIBLE isn't a strong enough word to describe Best Buy. Our son had been hospitalized all winter so we closed up his house and unplugged his refrigerator; when we brought him back to his house, we plugged in the refridg and it didn't work. We called around and Best Buy said they had one in the store and were making several deliveries in his area. (He lives in a remote area so we were excited that he could get it the very next day.) We made a special trip to their store in Duluth, MN to pay for it to ensure its delivery. Our son even got a phone call the next day saying they would show up between noon and 2:30. About 5 he called to say it never arrived and no one had the sense to call him and let him know. No one can be without a refridg in the summer; he had just spent over $500 to restock food in his house. He is still convalescing from his lengthy hospital stay and could not do anything on his own and we, his mother and 82-year-old step-father live 275 miles away from him. His sister and brother-in-law made a 6-hour trip one way to get him a refridg all because Best Buy said they could deliver his the very next day. We were so excited that Best Buy could deliver this, we quit looking for a different store for delivery. If my son had been strong enough, he could have taken care of this himself, but they were told he was on disability and couldn't do it himself so it was imperative we got the refridg immediately. We paid for delivery and removal of his old refridg; they, however could not fulfill their end of the deal. They put us all through a lot and I can guarantee I, nor any of his family, will ever enter a Best Buy store again.

Best Buy,Bought a Google Nest Wifi Mesh on line,"Bought a Google Nest Wifi Mesh on line. Guaranteed next day delivery. Item never showed and is now pushed out 4 more days.

Their guarantee is not a guarantee at all. I'm buying all my products somewhere else for now on. Best Buy let me down and did not fulfill their end of the deal.Update: The product finally showed up 4 days later. The package was delivered at 930PM, left Just outside my porch in view of anyone who would like to be a porch thief. Luckily the package was not stolen when I saw it the next morning.

Best Buy,Unscrupulous/Dishonorable,"Be aware of Best Buy’s unscrupulous activities. I have proof and fact that they have double charged my account when I placed an online order during this COVID-19 crisis. May 1, 2020 they charged my account the day I made the purchase online as I waited for my purchase they charged my account again for the same amount May 7, 2020. Here’s the caveat Because of COVID-19 there’s no way you can get anyone on the phone. now does anyone find this remotely interesting? Would you want to place your online order with the company that secretly double charges you? Do you find that to be a company with integrity and honor? Do you find a company that you cannot resolve this issue to be Unscrupulous? Dishonorable?",0,1

I requested for a refund after I dropped it off at UPS but unfortunately I have to wait for days before I can get a refund.

Best Buy,My favorite toy store,"I’ve bought a lot of stuff both large and small from BB over the years and never had a bad experience (other than the occasional know-it-all new clerk who insists on passing on incorrect information. I now make most of my purchases from the BB website. When I do visit one of their brick and mortar stores most of the clerks are knowledgeable and helpful.) BB as a company - I have no complaints, only kudos. I’ve had to return a few items and have NEVER had a problem with the process. I don’t remember any of my returns being faulty merchandise - honestly, just my mistakes or changes of mind. One shipment was lost by UPS/USPS somewhere between here and there and BB customer service shipped me a replacement with no hassles whatsoever. Their prices are competitive, the selection is good and I often make use of their financing options on larger purchases and reward points on the rest. When forced to do so by bottom-of-the-barrel customer service (I’m talking to YOU DoorDash and WalMart) I’ll sometimes leave a blistering one-star review, but I much prefer leaving good ones. I’m glad companies like BestBuy and Amazon make that so easy to do.",0,5

The next day, I received an email stating the phone wasn't available and if they couldn't get it by May 1, they would refund my money. On May 2, I received an email from Best Buy stating they were not able to fulfill my order and were refunding my money. One would think that with all the technology that exists, Best Buy would know their inventory and would have ceased taking orders or, at least, would have known how soon they would be able to replenish their inventory fulfill an order should a customer place an order. In stead, they held onto my money for ten days and the soonest I can now get a new iPhone SE from Apple will be May 20 and not May 10.

I was planning to give these to my baby cousins.Where it went terribly wrong...first, I receive an email that there was a delay. Fine. This can happen. No worries. Then, they email me weeks later that the delay email was sent by error and it will be sent by the original delivery date. Good news. Then, I get an email that both my orders were cancelled for no reason. Keep in mind that I placed my orders about ~5 months ago and only now do I hear about the cancellation. Given the demand of this product, it is now sold out everywhere, in which back when I placed the order, I could've ordered it elsewhere while available. Now, Best Buy screwed me big time. Insult to injury, I just received another email that the cancellation was made by error and I can reorder the products through a link. I click the link and it says the product is sold out. How does a company your size not exactly know the quantity of how much your customers can order and you joke and tease by back and forth emails, which in the end you say, ""thanks for pre-ordering with us almost half a year ago, we can't match the demand so we'll cancel your order for a full refund.

To this moment the app still says that the order is being processed. Days after receiving the email that the order had been shipped I could see that the delivery was changed to the Wednesday before, but as of Monday night (right now) UPS still has yet to receive a package to be delivered, so I’m not hopeful on that. Also, I only just realized that only the power supply is showing as shipped even when clicking the link in the email. I have no idea if the RAM will be in the same package or shipped separately since so far it seems that Best Buy has not been able to communicate one thing accurately to me. I’ve ordered things from China several times, all of which have been better at informing me where my package is, which, if you’ve never bought anything from China, is saying something. I’m just hoping my items make it to me, as I can’t cancel the order. Overall the worst online shopping experience I’ve ever had. If you’re looking for any electronics buy from B&H. Their customer service is amazing and since most of the items you’d buy are above their free shipping rates you’re almost guaranteed free two day shipping.",0,1
Best Buy,I am livid,"As I type this, my fiancé is currently on the phone with your customer service call center for the 6th time. I have never, in my life, experienced worse customer service from a company that I have been a life long customer. Let’s start from the beginning.We recently purchased appliances (a washer and dryer) with matching pedestals to be installed in our home. Your company delivered a product that was faulty (dented), and then asked us to request a new one through your call center, which we did. Upon this request, we were told that you no longer have the pedestal we purchased in stock (which we found online still in stock). We then proceeded to go to the store in which we found the pedestal in stock, and had conversations with the manager regarding the item. They asked us to once again call the phone number we previously called. In this instance, I asked if we could just take the floor model that was in stock, which the store manager allowed. However, we had to install the product ourselves and were given zero compensation. In short, Best Buy delivered a faulty product, and instead of them fixing the problem, we, the customers had to do so ourselves. If this were the end of it, I would not be writing this review. However, in purchasing our washer dryer, we also purchased a new TV for our home. This TV was not in store, but we were told it would be delivered to us. I (at this point) did not trust Best Buy, but my fiancé still had faith in your business. He agreed, and on the date before delivery, we were told it would arrive between 7AM – 1PM and were asked to be home between these hours. We stayed home, and as 2PM rolled around, we once again call your customer service line, asking where our product is. They tell us that it had not been shipped from the warehouse, thus would not be delivered. In speaking with your customer service, we ask to speak to a supervisor, and are denied that request. How this occurs is beyond me, but we reschedule a delivery date for the following week. Once again, we received a text reminder, but this time received a specific time of 9:45 AM and a delivery driver name. As 10:45 AM rolls around, we call your customer service, and AGAIN are told that the TV has not been shipped from the warehouse. The sole cause of this frustration is that fact that we received multiple texts and emails saying that the delivery is scheduled for a specific date/time and at no point did we receive any communication that it would be delayed. I am not sure what to do at this point – go through the process of a full refund or continue to schedule delivery dates that are not being met. We both understand that these are strange times, but the lack of communication on Best Buy’s end is completely unacceptable. The amount of work they make their customers do if Best Buy creates a problem is also unacceptable. The lack of compensation for our hassle/troubles is downright poor customer service, and the number of loyal Best Buy customers has shrunk by two. In typing this, I am floored by the fact that we have yet been able to speak to a supervisor or manager regarding the issue, and downright advise anyone thinking of buying products from this company to seriously reconsider their choice.",0,1

Best Buy,Today I called Best Buys and the…,"Today I called Best Buys and the recordings said BB opens at 10:00 am. I live 40 miles away from the Chico, CA store. Upon arriving I was met by 3 young males outside of the store. They asked what I needed. I told them that I wanted to purchase 2 Samsung tablets and a large screen TV. They told me I had to go back to my car, use my phone to order the items on line. I told them that I had no idea what I was ordering, that I wanted to see what was available. I'm a senior, I get by on some limited computer knowledge. Nope, they weren't going to help me out with that either. The discussion got heated and insulting. I asked them what their plans were when the store closes and they're out of a job. The way you are treating me, a CASH customer, that the store won't be open for long. One of the millennials said ""you're 90- years old, I'll last longer than you!"" WHAT? I asked for their names and they refused to give me their names. I drove over to Costco and purchased what I wanted, was helped out by knowledgeable people. I also used my credit card to receive 3% cash back. I'll never step foot into Best Buyer ever!4/4/2020",0,1

Best Buy,I hate that I have to leave a star,I hate that I have to leave a star. Used to be a great place to buy electronics and household items and used to have a wonderful warranty program but not anymore. We bought a computer for my daughter with a warranty that was almost the cost of the computer that covered all damage to the computer. We were told when buying the computer by their sales rep that if anything happened you could bring the computer in and they will replace it. Not true you have to take it to Geek Squad and they have to look at an then make a determination if they are going to replace it. You have to call geek squad which we have tried to contact for 2 Days been hung up on several times and been on hold for hours on end just trying to speak with someone so they can send us a box so we can send the computer back and then they can return it to you 3 to 4 WEEKS LATER. I called to the cooperate office to Corie Barry the CEO and I was told by her staff this is their process and sorry. I said this not very good customer service for a company that makes 42.88 BB in revenue and his response was sorry that is how we do business. They obviously do not care one bit about their customer service and DO NOT BUY THEIR WARRANTY it is a HUGE SONG AND DANCE trying to get them to replace the broken item. GEEK SQUAD IS A JOKE. I will never buy anything from them again. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,0,1

Best Buy,Best buy and geek squad corrupt,"This story is far too long to list details but I can tell you that two Best Buy or geek squad con men came out to my house to hang a TV and install a home theater system. They threw away the television stand hardware because it had too many parts and would be some work. He went and got four bolts and screwed the TV in that way. Now it is hanging over and I am having to hold it up with cut two by fours. He said my router was Not strong enough to reach the television so he had to sell me a $200 erro system. He said my $49 Amazon fire would not work and give me Dolby Atmos so I had to buy $175 Apple TV. He’s sold me an 8 footHDMI cable when I only needed 2 feet and had four extras laying right here, 50 bucks for that one. Thing is I just disconnected the eero unit and my router is plenty strong without it. I disconnected the Apple TV and installed my Amazon fire, it works just fineAnd gets Dolby Atmos. All this stuff is laying in the corner and I am not driving the 35 miles one way to return it. I have sent five letters to corporate, call store manager, call regional manager and absolutely no response. They screwed me to the boneAnd refuse to do anything about it. I am not paying for the extra BS they sold me and didn’t need, nor am I paying for the $4000 TV. Yup, it will hurt my credit but no way I’m giving into these corporate crooks. Please stay away from Best Buy and there geek squad! Conns Or Nebraska furniture Mart is far far better,Anyplace is better than Best Buy. Cost me $960 total and I absolutely needed none of the things they sold me, none of them. Now TV is falling over!Even their CEO at this company is under investigation for inappropriate relations with an employee. Corrupt from top to bottom!!!By the way, if you look at other review sites they have a little over one star review. So I am not the only one. Just please don’t go to Best Buy or you might end up like meOh yes, they will be quick to tell you these guys don’t get commission, but that is BS, they get incentives for how much they sell you.

Best Buy,Best Buy has been going downhill in…,"Best Buy has been going downhill in service for some time now. But my latest visit after COVID-19 was so bad that I had to write a review. They have closed the store and only provide online or have you stand outside and place an order through an employee under their tent. Okay. I get it. Protecting both the customer and employee. But the system is outrageously flawed. It took me more than an hour to NOT get my order. After standing curbside for 15 or so minutes. I placed the order and was told they would call me when my order was complete. I left and picked up a few things at Home Depot came back and waited in front of the store. I received a call saying they didn't have the headphones on my order (that they previously said they had). Okay, I still want the other items. In the meantime my daughter-in-law started searching for a headset that BestBuy didn't have. She found them at Office Depot. We went there. She picked up her headphones. Still no call from BestBuy. Seeing the ease of shopping at Office Depot, I went inside and found the item I needed for $14 less. I made my purchase and left in less than 10 minutes. Still no call from BestBuy!Once I got home, I checked my texts and they had sent a text confirming my order was ready for pickup. IF YOU WE'RE GOING TO TEXT ME DON'T, SAY YOU ARE GOING TO CALL. I cancelled my order my order of course. They should be refunding my purchase amount minus $10. That's a lie. I want ALL my money and an apology for the inconvenience.",0,1

No installation, just leave on porch.1. They did not deliver even though the website claimed it was 'out for delivery'2. When I I called on the 28 the inquire about the TV I got the worse agent possible. She didn't want to help me and I feel she didnt even want to be on the job.3. They are having me wait 3 more weeks WITH NO EXPLANATION of why they did not deliver on the 27th like it was scheduled. When asked to speak to a supervisor she refused claiming that the supervisor would tell me I have to wait 3 weeks for delivery.4. There was ABSOLUTELY no attempt to help me out at all.5. There were NO emails telling me they could not deliver, there were no emails to say even that something happened and they were sorry they failed to deliver on promised date.This the worst experience I have ever had with ANY retailer. Bar none.There is no excuse with not trying at least to help me out.I am handicap and planned to hire folks to assist me getting the TV from porch to house. They along with me waited til 9PM for the TV that was never delivered with no reason as to why delivery was not made.I wish I had remembered the name of the agent so I could with Best Buy Corporate as to why she was so short with me. Horrible horrible experience. If I had not wanted this TV so bad I would have cancelled the order.

Best Buy,BestBuy Ripoff During National Emergency,"Our refrigerator stopped working on 3/15/20, so I ordered a new one on the same day with free delivery, hookup, and paid an extra $25 for haul away. I chose the earliest available delivery date/time which was 3/23/20 morning. After it past the time of delivery and not receiving an update, I called back on 3/23/20 afternoon. I was told that because of the Coronavirus situation, now they only do delivery at the doorstep. Since I had been over a week without a refrigerator and desperately needed one, I said fine and rescheduled the next earliest delivery on 3/25/20, knowing that it would be heck of a job for me to move it inside my second floor condo unit. At the time, when I asked about the haul away, I was told that if I brought it outside they would take it. On 3/25/20, the delivery truck came, dropped off the refrigerator outside the condo's front door in the rain. When I asked about the haul away, I was told that they would not take anything back to the warehouse in fear of bringing back the virus. It took me 1.5 hours to move the refrigerator into my unit. Worst yet, the next day, I saw a $69.99 charge on my credit card for the delivery even though on the product page it still said free doorstop delivery. Now I have to spend time have the $69.99 charge reversed and BestBuy still owe me the haul-away of my old fridge that I paid $25 for. I think it is extremely unethical for BestBuy to take advantage of its customers in a time like this. On the other hand, my neighbor ordered a new refrigerator on 3/23/20 from Costco and it was delivered inside the unit, hooked up, and with his old one hauled away on 3/27/20, just that simple. I would avoid buying anything from BestBuy like the plague from now on.",0,1

Best Buy,I rarely write online reviews but I was…,"I rarely write online reviews but I was recently so outraged by Best Buy that I had to warn others so they don't have a similar experience. I recently purchased a 65"" flat screen from Best Buy. It was on sale and seemed like a pretty good deal. I ordered from their online site which went smoothly and included free delivery. The TV arrived in a few days and I accepted delivery after carefully examining the outside of packaging for any obvious damage that might have occurred during shipping (there was none). A day later I carefully unpacked the TV by simply removing the straps and lifting off the carton cover - I never tipped the tv in any direction - it simply stood in an upright position in my living room from the moment it arrived. After carefully removing the packaging, I discovered the screen had been severely damaged at the very bottom - below the protective styrofoam shipping sleeve. There is NO WAY that happened during shipping (unless it was dropped???) because the protective packaging was in perfect condition and the damage occurred behind the protective sleeve. To be clear - the damage was not a slight crack - it was smashed in a fashion that looked like someone had struck it with a hammer. Of course I immediately called my local Best Buy retailer expecting to simply exchange the damaged set for another. After being transferred to the manager, I was stunned when he said he would not accept any return or exchange - claiming I must have damaged the item myself. I couldn't believe it until I READ OTHER REVIEWS of BEST BUY and discovered that the same thing has happened to MANY of their customers - especially with TVs. My entire family has been loyal to BEST BUY for decades - but no more. I will never buy anything from them again - even if they are the lowest price. The money the will lose from my wife and 2 teenage daughters will far exceed what they made on my broken TV. So, consider yourself warned! BEST BUY clearly does not care about individual customers, despite their claims to the contrary.",0,1
Best Buy,Disappointed customer,"I have been a costumer of Best Buy for many, many years. With my kids growing up I have bought computers, laptops, games, electronic devices etc... 2 years ago I bought a new home and I bought my 2 smart tvs and a washer and dryer from Best Buy. In less than a year one of the tvs quit working. I called the store and I was told I had to bring it in. Once at the store I had to carry the 50 inch tv in by myself because no body offered to help me. My kids are grown so it's obvious I'm of age. So the tv had to be sent out for repairs and they couldn't guarantee it's return prior to 3 weeks. I requested a loaner tv they offered to sell me another one but was denied to put it on the credit card. I have never been late on any of my credit card payments in the 5 years I've had this card. I came back to the store 3 weeks later to pick up my tv and again I had to carry it out myself because customer service is not available to help. They only time they help is to sell you stuff like in a car dealership. Once I got the tv home it still was not working. Geek squad came to my house 3 times before this brand new tv would work. So now that the world is in a crisis due to this pandemic I lost my job. I've noticed how so many people and companies are all helping each other but not Best Buy. I called Best Buy credit card to see if they could help me and after being on hold for over 30 minutes they told me they would hold off on this next payment but I would have to pay it the following month along with that months payments and the late fees. What type of help is that? I told them that I will never shop there again and I will let everyone know how greedy and selfish they have become. I'm tempted to post this on Facebook.",0,1
Best Buy,In January of this year,"In January of this year, I bought an Oral-B refill at Best Buy.

I complained & he said go to customer service. I went to customer service & spoke to the manager. He did as I requested. He deducted the $5 & charged my credit card. So, I was charged twice for one item! I filed a claim with my credit card company & the claim was denied. The extra charge was initially removed but Best Buy charged my credit card again. I called my credit card company & was told that the claim was denied & that there was nothing that the credit card company could do. So, because the 1st cashier at Best Buy screwed up, I was charged twice for a single item. I called Best Buy & was put on hold. I hope that it can be resolved.If I could rate Best Buy with zero stars I would. The disputed charge was $42.11 but suppose that I had bought a computer & was charged $1,000 twice.

Best Buy,Best Buy continues to be the worst,"Best Buy continues to be the worst retailer out there - I can't wait until they go out of business, and honestly can't believe it hasn't happened yet.Their ""Price Match Guarantee"" is totally bogus - they only price match against a select few sites, so even if your product is available elsewhere on the internet, they won't price match it (I wouldn't care but I was unlucky enough to receive a $150 gift card at Christmas that's basically unusable if you're not interested in overpaying)Secondly - I did manage to find an item to purchase, however was an open box listed in ""Excellent Condition"" with ""No accessories missing"" - it was a Playstation 4 Pro Bundle (includes a game) (no SKU for a non open box was available) - The list of items missing was longer than the list of items actually included: No Power Cord, No Game, No Controller - Like what the heck? Who inspected this thing and listed it that way - only came with the PS4 and an HDMI cable.I then called into customer support - obviously busy, so requested a call back - they did within the timeframe they stated, however I then waited on hold for another 15min. I then explained the situation to the representative and he did his research to find out what can be done - surprise, nothing other than returning it can be done. I even offered to keep the item and for them to just give me the missing accessories, seems kind of like a win-win, but no. Since this wasn't an option and the bundle I wanted is no longer available my only option is to re-purchase the PS4 pro at full price and then the game at full price - perfect, no thanks!I gave up shopping at best buy years ago for reasons similar to this one - the only reason why I had this recent experience is due to a gift card.

My delivery window comes and goes with no delivery and no text. I get online to check status and get a message stating my order cannot be found. I call and wait on hold for 1 1/2 hours to find out Best Buy cancelled all weekend deliveries and will reschedule; however, all deliveries will be drop off outside the front door only. They will not deliver inside or install due to COVID-19. I understand delaying deliveries to help prevent the spread of this virus, but I should have received a call informing me my delivery was canceled. I should not have had to deal with the inconvenience of emptying my refrigerator and freezer and waiting on hold that long. When asked how they would compensate me for this inconvenience and lack of customer service of any type I was told they could not offer a discount until the order was completed. As a result I canceled my order and will never purchase from Best Buy again.",0,1
Best Buy,I had a delivery scheduled and they did cancelled the shipment after having to pay contractor to wait,I had a delivery scheduled and they did not show up. It was rescheduled for the following Monday. I spent hours on hold on the phone and on chat at the same time. I understand that they are changing some procedures due to the pandemic but since they are delivering outside the door now. Anybody can plug in a fridge and stove. I did not ask for installation only the parts for the install. This is the excuse on the phone. Totally unacceptable. Had to pay a contactor extra hours as they did not show up.Will never buy anything again from Best Buy.,0,1

Best Buy,"After purchasing from this company for over 10 years, I will never place an order with them again.","To preface, I understand that with everything going on in the world right now, there are WAY bigger problems to worry about. I am definitely NOT angry at the fact that my package will not be delivered on time. I'm a grown man, and I can handle that. Also, as a former support rep, I understand that it's usually not the rep's fault, so nothing personal there for them as well. What bothers me is how this issue was handled (or, in this case, not handled), as they had about a year's worth of time just to update a simple shipping address!I pre-ordered an item back in June 2019. 2 months pass, and I move to a different apartment. Obviously, I need my shipping address changed.I give Best Buy a call in August 2019, they tell me that they cannot modify the shipping address until a few months out from the ship date (March 20, 2020).I call again in December 2019, they say they cannot update the shipping address until a month out.I call back in Feb 2020, they say that they cannot adjust the shipping address until a tracking number is generated.A tracking number is generated on March 19th 2020, I call them again. They tell me that the shipping address has been adjusted, and it will be sent to the correct address on time.On March 20th 2020, the item is still in route to the wrong address. Spoke to a rep, they just said 'Sorry! We'll fix this so that it will not happen in the future'. Okay? How about right now? You think I want to come back after this? I do not have an ETA for when the package will be delivered.I would understand if I waited until the last minute to change the address, but I've been trying to get it updated for about a year. You're telling me a big company like Best Buy doesn't have the resources to fix this issue within that time frame, let alone, give the customer an option to update on their end? Every time I tried, it just told me to contact support!",0,1
Best Buy,Don’t uphold warranties,"My husband and I bought a Sony 49 inch flat screen TV in June 2017 and bought the 2 year extended warranty from Best Buy on Hwy 280 in Birmingham Alabama and here it is March 2020 and now our TV is messing up. I called to get the TV repaired and they say that it’s not under warranty .when you buy an extended warranty that means extends the warranty for X amount of years , they don’t tell people that they do the first year of your extended warranty in coincide with factory warranty Makes you wonder how many people they have cheated money out of buying extended warranty tell them that it adds on to the manufacture warranty and then when you need it they don’t want to cover your TV that’s pretty sorry on Best Buy’s and they need to have better customer service instead of having people that are not honest working for them . We are in the COVID 19 virus all over the world nearly, if the president call for state wide quarantine and out tv goes completely out , we won’t have anything to watch",0,1

Best Buy,Look elsewhere online for your…,"Look elsewhere online for your electronic needs!Enthusiastic floor employees. Their website and registers at the store are very slow.Here are some shady things I have noticed:-General bait and switch tactics-Advertised prices change often, even during business hours-Warranties are not always as long as shown on or in the boxI purchased a ASUS computer from them back in 2017 during the gpu crisis. The NVIDIA GTX 1070 GPU in it died one month later. I paid to have it shipped out only to be quoted $600 for out of warranty repair of the computer. The computer was only $800 when I got it!. They shipped it back cause I didn't respond that day and in the 2 months it took to get it back I had already purchased a new computer. When it finally got back it was fixed. Sold it cause I already had a new computer.Pre-orders are charged before the sale and again when you pick it up. Then, the first charge is returned a few weeks later. Make sure you have at least double the available credit needed on the card you use.Car remote starter install kits are purposely sold with missing parts needed for the installation to try and get you to use their install services. They hide these parts in the back, forcing you to come back to the store multiple times with them trying to convince you that you aren't capable of installing one yourself. My remote start works just fine after I got the parts for it. I'm not that dumb and am capable of safely installing one. Anyone who goes out to an auto parts store and replaces their brake pads has arguably more dangerous possible outcomes.I saw online that an SSD I had just bought a few days before was half the price it had been. The person at the customer service told me that it was a bundle deal and that I had to buy these other cheap items I don't need to get the price. In the time it took to obtain the other items, the bundle deal was gone and the price of the SSD was now four times as much. All they could say was ""Well that's weird, do you still want to buy it all?"" Do they really think I'm gonna buy extra stuff just cause I came to the store?",0,1

Next thing I know, I am getting an automated( of course they don't have a real person with a heart calling) stating my payment is LATE. I used the automated help on the website because I was on hold too long for a real person. Obviously, they only have one person working on phones so they're always busy. Hannah would not waive those late fee on a bill I never received. This has to be a desperate a=act for a company that is barely surviving. Gee, I wonder why everyone is going to Amazom.

Best Buy,If I could give this company negative…,"If I could give this company negative stars I would. 3 Weeks ago my fridge stopped working and I went to Best Buy to purchase another Refrigerator. I agreed. to have someone (From Best Buy) come to my apartment and measure the space the fridge would go into. According to the sales rep, after measuring my home the in home consultant would have a list of refrigerators I could choose from. After coming into my home and measuring, he left and said he would be right back. After 20 minutes, he did not show up so I called him with no answer. I went to the Best Buy store and made a complaint that this guy left and telling me he would be back. After waiting in the store for an hour, the manager got a hold of the consultant who gave he my measurements. I was able to purchase a refrigerator that night. That night we agreed on a delivery date. My refrigerator was scheduled to be delivered on a Thursday from 12-6pm. I received a text message from best buy. They would remove my old refrigerator and deliver my new one. I received a text that the delivery would be form 1200-2pm . At 2:30 after they did not show up, I called customer service. According to customer service they did not show up to my house because it was raining. No one called me to say they were canceling. Again (2nd time) I Went down to the store and talked to customer service. I explained to them that I worked evenings and they could deliver my refrigerator anytime before 1pm. NOPE the only times they could come is 12-6pm. After failing to deliver my refrigerator, I redeived no apology. They did not work with me, They told me these were the days and Times they could deliver my refrigeratorAnother date and time to deliver my refrigerator and remove my old one. The delivery person came one time and entered my home. After taking a snap shot of my refrigerator he left and told me he needs to talk to my partner. After waiting 20minutes I walked to my parking lot and they were gone. (This was the second time a BEST BUY delivery employee left without saying anything. It turns out they did not want to remove my old refrigerator. i went to Best Buy (3rd Time) upset, after 3 weeks I still did not have my refrigerator. I spoke with the assistant manager, I was upset that my refrigerator was not delivered. I was more upset on how these delivery employees just left without any communication. I was upset in-store customer service did not care. I was crying and left the store emotionally exhausted. I wanted to purchase a refrigerator, I did no think that it would be as mentally and emotionally taxing",0,1
Best Buy,I will not shop here again,I will not shop here again. I was told by text that my order was at the store for pick up. When I got there they asked me to wait because my freezer was behind alot of other orders and it would be a minute. I waited 20 minutes. The sales person came back out and said..Your order is not here. We are not sure where it is but you can come back in a few days to see if it's here or call us. Well I tried calling and they won't answer. So I called their 1-800 number for assistance. They couldn't even get a hold of the store. I was on hold for 35 minutes. He said all he could do was send emails to reach out and find out where our item is. This is an inconvenience. I still have no answer to where my item is. This is the Best Buy in Knoxville TN.

Best Buy,"WORST BUY, HATES HANDICAPPED CUSTOMERS","Due to being recently disabled, unable to drive and needing a walker had to order a Panasonic Microwave online with a 4 year extended warranty. After much searching their various stores in my area placed the order from what I thought was my local Best Buy (that stated it was in stock) on March 5. Wrong on all counts. Best Buy sent an email 7 hours later in the middle of the night stating the order was delayed indefinitely and they had until April 3 to deliver and after that I could cancel the order. WHAT?! Called the customer service that morning and was told their computer was “locked out” of my order for 24 hours and to call back the next day to cancel the order. Called 24 hours later and was assured the order would be canceled, credit would be posted in 24-48 hours. Only the extended warranty was canceled. The next day, another email stating my package was shipped via UPS from a store over an hour away. Microwave arrived in a badly damaged Panasonic packaging with shipping labels slapped on it. Unbelievable! Had a huge hole in the one side of the box and three of four corners were crushed. Struggled to unbox the microwave only to discover the area with the hole went through the manufacturers packaging and into the back of the microwave. The open door button was also damaged and would not release. Called to return it and was given the same “locked out” of my order. Called the next day and was told to give UPS the return authorization and I could arrange for the date of pickup. WRONG AGAIN. When I typed the number UPS asked me to PAY for the pick up. Yup ANOTHER customer service call this time I was told I had to buggy lug a 47 POUND damaged box to the front of my apartment building with NO ADVANCED WARNING so UPS could pick it up. I am disabled, can’t walk and now have to drag this very HEAVY box the length of my building or PAY FOR THE RETURN! I am also a widow and have no one near me that can help me. Injured my shoulders and back dragging that 50 pound box to my lobby. Still waiting for my refund. I will NEVER patronize Best Buy again. I share this MISERABLE experience with EVERYONE I meet. Stay away, STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM BEST BUY! They should change their name to WORST BUY, more appropriate.",0,1
Best Buy,not adhering to safety recommendations for corona virus protection for at risk population,"I ordered a freezer for pickup. It was ready to be picked up today. I called store manager, explained my husband and I are in high risk and self-quarantined population. I asked her if she could meet me outside to verify my ID so My husband and I could retrieve the pre-paid freezer. Manager Melissa said corporate policy would not allow to do so and gave me the number for corporate office. I called, got ""Tom"" who said he was the switchboard operator. He said corporate policy would not allow my ID information to be outside to avoid my being exposed to corona virus contamination inside. He was rude. i asked for his supervisor. He denied having one. I thought I heard his name as ""Paul"" but he declared it was ""Tom"". This may have been his afterthought after I told him I was sure he had a supervisor. I told him I was going to let the news know of Best Buy not complying with the recommendations to avoid exposure to corona virus. ""Tom or Paul"" hung up on me. i called Manager Melissa back. I was told all the managers were in a meeting. We went to Best Buy at Hotel Circle location in Albuquerque to retrieve the freezer. The pickup office is almost immediately after the entry way. All the clerk asked for was to look at my license and my phone number. Then, he took the freezer outside. Manager Melissa, if she wanted to, could have apologized or even taken my id from the entry way which is 5 seconds away from inside pickup counter. The person (Paul or Tom) who answered the switchboard at the corporate was insolent and rude ensuring that no member of my family will ever shop at Best Buy again.",0,1

I heard nothing from them and when I log in to track order it just says there is a delay and that if they can't get it to me by April 9th they will cancel the order. I understand that from the time I ordered it until now, the demand for these went up in light of people stocking up for potential quarantine and there may have been supply chain issues. However, they have indeed charged my account and I at least feel like some info is in order. Even just where it may be snagged up, an estimate on ETA but nothing, just ""hey, we may have it for you, a month behind schedule or maybe not"". In addition, it is damn near impossible to talk to someone. I don't have time to be on hold for 2 hours or wait in a chat queue. They clearly do not care. If I would have known it would be like this I would have ordered from a place I've already worked with. This is the first time I have ever bought something at Best Buy and I can say without doubt this will be the last. I would just cancel the order but by now every other place in the country has sold out. Now totally in limbo.

Best Buy,I ordered a laptop through Best Buy,I ordered a laptop through Best Buy. I ordered it in store because they didn’t have any in stock. I ordered it February 18th and was told I could pick it up on March 5th. I go to pick it up and they said they don’t really know when it’ll get there but to at least wait 3 more business days. And that they would send me an email once they get my laptop in store. I told them my email was no longer working and I have a new one. I asked them to update and they said they would but they have no promises I would get an email on my new one since I put my old email on the order. I left the store and I wanted to at least know a guesstimate of when I would be receiving my laptop. I track my order through their website with my order number it told me if my order wasn’t there by April 4th it would be canceled. And I called into customer service multiple times asking if they could at least see if my order has been shipped. (At that point I could at least have a clue of when it would get to the store) they told me they didn’t know but assured it would get there as fast as possible. I called back in to customer service and explained to them I wanted to at least know if it’s been shipped or if not refund my money and I’ll directly order it through Apple and get my laptop in 2 weeks not in one month. I’ve talked to multiple people and multiple customer service representatives at this point. I call back in and this time I spoke to Leann in the mobile order support department. Leann needs a raise and I give her a 5 star rating. I explained to her what was happening and she said we can figure something out for you I just need to do some digging. Leann called multiple stores and figured out that my item was actually lost. I’m so grateful for Leann and if she didn’t do that I would just be waiting for an item that would have never gotten here! So she transferred me to someone else stayed on the phone the whole time to make sure they got the information they needed. I appreciate her. She then hung up but I was on the phone with another representative this person then told me they have to file a claim and told me my refund would take a billing cycle. I asked them how long that is. The person told me a month but said it would probably be about 10-15 business days. I told him no I’m not waiting that long to get my refund especially for something that wasn’t my fault. I asked to speak with a manager and told me it would take about 7 business days because they have to file a claim. I told them I wanted my money back right now and even if it’s an ACH transaction it wouldn’t take 7 business days. He told me he couldn’t do that because he has to file the claim. I told him to cancel my refund and I’m going in the store to get my money back. I go to the store and they are showing that my item was shipped out! I told them what I was told over the phone. He told me I could get a refund or look at other models in the store. I informed him I didn’t want a different model. So he did the refund and told me it’ll take 3 business days. Which I am okay with I know it takes a few business days. But for a refund to take 10-15 business or even a month that is ridiculous. I’m so frustrated with Best Buy and not impressed with their customer service. Leann and the guy who finally gave me my refund were the only ones to really help. I was on the phone for 2 hours and then eventually just went into the store. When they should have just refunded my money and told me in the first place that my refund would be there in a few business days. I won’t ever order through Best Buy again. But I do thank Leann for all of her help and actually trying to get this figured out for me. Give this girl a raise!,0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy's customer service is…,"Best Buy's customer service is atrocious. A true joke, with nothing but contempt for the fools who buy from them. Recently purchased a preorder of a Nintendo Switch game. (Bundle of the game and a separate related toy). I preordered the physical cartridge version of the game. Weeks later, but weeks before the game released, Best Buy emailed me an ""update"" about my digital download. Never ordered a digital download, just a cartridge. When called their ""customer service"", they refused to discuss directly, instead transferring me to the (pretend ?) digital download department. After 15 minutes on hold, they hung up on me. Contacted ""agent"" through their website. Who regretted to inform me that their policy is can't change digital orders. So no, would not change my order to the cartridge actually ordered. And no refund. Despite both versions being the exact same price. And both not available for weeks anyway!So their ""customer service"" ""regrettably"" tells me am screwed. What nonsense!

Best Buy,Best Buy customer service is a joke,Best Buy customer service is a joke. I purchased headphones and when they did not work I tried to return them as they stated I could. I returned them within 30 days. Because I purchased them in Canada and tried to return in California they did not honor. The return policy. They took the product and said write a letter to customer service. This I did and three months latter I received a letter back asking me to call them . I spent over an hour and was finally told that there was nothing they could do. So I am currently out the money and they have the head phones. I have spent over 5K in the last 3 years with em and this is how they treat good customers. DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE. Shop somewhere else !,0,1
Best Buy,Do Not Shop at Best Buy,"Unfortunately, I wish I could score the company no stars. I reach out to Best Buy for assistance with fixing a TV I purchased from them and discuss how much it would cost. I called the store three times to every time I was on hold for 30 minutes and then hung up on. I went online to chat with a rep who I explained my situation to. The rep told me that the issue would be covered by a warranty. Advised me to go to a store with the TV and I would get help. I asked him twice if he was sure this was correct and he agreed it was. That was incorrect information and I learned that after driving to the closest Best Buy which is an hour and 15 minutes away. The store rep told me that I should have called them first. When I explained I tried three times, the store rep told me that the number online is incorrect and the correct phone number isn't anywhere online. The store rep told me to call the warranty line which then, I learned the warranty couldn't cover the issue. When I complained, I received a $25 gift card. Since I was not happy with the response, I placed a BBB complaint due to the fact the $25 gift card didn't even cover my gas to get to the store. Best buy then responded that they couldn't do anything for the lie I was told. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND never shopping at Best Buy. I have always purchased my TVs and sounds systems at Best Buy but after all the hoops I went through that they told me to do and I still didn't get help, I will never shop there and will spread the word to others to never shop there.",0,1
Best Buy,DO NOT shop at Bestbuy,"DO NOT shop at Bestbuy! Zero customer service or common sense. Ordered an item under my Bestbuy account, my wife paid for it with her card as a birthday gift. They notified me (not her) that it was ready for pickup.I went to pick it up, and even though it's my account, listed under my purchases, my phone number, notified my cell via text, and even with both wife and I listed under ""Friends and Family"" as pickup persons, they refused to let me pick it up. I then logged in, right in front of them, while they watched, since it was under my account, and added myself as primary pickup person.Doing that created a new order number, and when I showed them they said it wasn't ready for pickup?With the item paid for and sitting there in front of them no less, but because I added myself as primary they didn't even know if they had it in stock anymore because the one they had was listed ONLY for my wife to pickup (which was not true, it only showed her as paying for it with her card) and now that I changed primary pickup person even she could not pick it up? All this coming from the ""manager""?When I said I would just cancel and order on Amazon, the response ""oh ok, that would be fine, we would be glad to cancel the order for you""Ummm ok, so I can cancel the order, change primary pickup, both wife and I listed under ""friends and family"" yet now no one can pickup the order? I hope the store manager reads this, as I'm sure my business won't make or break them, but it might make a difference to this location and the store managers bonus program if this is the kind of resources they hire as associates and managers, not able to see what's going on, happier to see you cancel and order and go somewhere else.I'm now closing my Bestbuy accounts, and credit account via Citybank, and will NEVER buy anything from Bestbuy again. This is why next day shipping and top customer service from Amazon is hurting local business, not the price or convenience",0,1

I buy from Amazon all the time with no issues and quick delivery. I have spent over an hour on the phone trying to resolve my order and they just want me to place the order again to get it out to me.

I called back again the following day and this time was told I couldn't cancel the order.

Best Buy,TERRIBLE Experience,TERRIBLE. I have experienced nothing but problems dealing with this store. The customer service is very distasteful to say the least and the managers that are around and on duty aren’t looking to resolve any actual problems. They were more concerned with getting me out the door and passing the issue on to the next than actually fixing the problem. This store (WHITEMARSH #159)allowed there employee on Duty (Alexander) from Geek Squad to Argue with the customer (ME) with the actual Manager on duty present (Marvin) In front of employees of Best Buy and other potential customers of Best Buy. With minor interjections from Marvin stating “Let her speak “ which I appreciate but nonetheless still very unprofessional.I urge anyone thinking of going to this location NOT to. This post is just a *** DISCLAIMER *** to inform other potential customers of the type of environment that you’ll be walking into. KEY TAKEAWAYS:What to expect from Best Buy Whitemarsh store #1591. Poor Professional 2. RUDE Discourteous behavior 3. Lack of Urgency 4. Lack of Manners5. Long waits in line (Even with an Appointment Scheduled doesn’t matter specifically Geek Squad) They make you wait !6. Extremely Long wait on the phone (They use a Phone Hub in which all calls go to.

Things do change with Amazon especially with the one day delivery.We looked at a sound bar during president day and this was lowered by $100 to $299. We opted to check prior to purchase and that evening did commit to a online savings from Amazon by $70. Yes they have price matching, but why bother to call, and prove you can get a better price.

Best Buy,Don't Waste Your Time,"I wanted to send a present of an item I saw on Best Buy. When I ordered it online, I guess I hit the option of having it delivered to the store instead of the address of the person I wished to have it shipped to.I realized my mistake immediately and went on the chat line to correct it. The Rep didn't understand at first and then said she did and that it was all taken care of. Then I checked my email and saw that it was now being delivered to my own home.So I called CS and the man (very nice, but English was definitely not his first language) took so long in getting the information that the half hour they give to make corrections ended while he was trying to spell the name and get the address of the person getting the gift. So I have to have it shipped to me at home and deliver it myself. Nothing can be done after that magic half hour.Ridiculous! Since when did Best Buy begin to think they are Amazon?!

However, we are unable to re-attach the cable based on where it is located.

Are you kidding me? For a faulty installation, we now have to wait for them to fix it for SIX days? They say their goal is to provide excellent customer service and from this lack of urgency I give them the score of ""royal f**##k up"". I will NEVER buy from BEST Buy again and suggest you don't either!!!Next Day, Feb 21st update: My husband made 2 trips to the store in Wellington, FL where we purchased the TV, and after speaking with the General Manager, Mr. Ramos, he arranged for the installer (Geek Squad agent) that installed our TV to come by our home and fix the problem.

The store said I could make the purchase out of pocket then get the card replaced within the 15 day return policy for the purchase and bring it to the store and they would issue a return (refund) then resell the item using the gift card.Long story short customer service is a total joke and completely incompetent. They tell you one thing, it doesn't happen, then theyapologize and tell you something else. When that doesn't happen they apologize and tell you someting else. They can't even track the replacement card shipment or tell me who the carrier is. First it's UPS, FED-EX OR USPS. Then it's supposed to be one of their own little delivery vehicles ( ha ha ).

Best Buy,Geek Squad or Lost Squad(My 500 clients will know Lost Squad),"I have to say, I have bought product in the past at Best Buy and the product performed at the value it represented. However this time, my wife purchased a laptop the Lenovo 731 as to be used in my business. Fine machine, but the work performed by the GeekSquad here in North Chula Vista.nearly put me out of business after 40 years. I prepare tax returns with 500 to 550 returns each year.I had had some connection problems with the internet on the previous computer, a Dell. With the charged protection policy purchased, I had confidence that the Squad would do correct work. The 'SQUAD' loaded my new computer with the programs that were on the Dell. When I received a email they were ready for pick up I rushed down BB. When I got to my office to set the computers up I freaked out when I did not see the three years of tax software programs with client returns on them.. I opened files everywhere. By the way the Geek Squad ICON with my saved files was on the opening screen of one computer and not on the other one. There were some programs saved on both computers but no tax programs. i had between 1,200 and 1,600 tax returns completed and saved on those machines. I spent about five hours trying to retrieve them. As I was panicking that these clients will be very angry that there info was lost, and i would be out of business. Very upset, but respectful, I rushed down to Best Buy for a solution. I explained what I knew and was immediately asked if I had an appointment. I said no and had to make an appointment three hours later. When I came back and explained what I was missing I was told that no files were deleted,that all files that were on my original laptop were then copied to the new computer. The 'tech' did not even try to look for my files on either computer, and if I did not see them, I needed to reload the programs. i couldn't do that; as I did not want to lose the tax returns that I already had on the programs. So he said there as nothing else he could do. I went home frustrated and worried that I had lost (I should say, The Geek Squad) my 1,500 tax returns. I could have serious issues with the IRS over this problem. I went back home and called my software company and explained to them what happened. They told me they could not help me bring back any returns unless I had the program on the computer(not reloaded). So I spent another five hours trying to solve my problem. Then I thought, I will make another appointment with ""The Geek Squad"" and when I go there which was two days later, I would have my software tech talk to your techs. When I got there I got the same ""tech""? who talked to me before and he asked me if I was in for the same problem. I said yes, but one of my software techs to talk to you to tell you what needs to be done. He took the call went in the back room, came out five minutes later, telling me my tech told him for me to reload the prgrm back up. I told him I couldn't believe he said since they told me not to do it. He gave me the phone back hung up. So I said, ""then you're telling me you can't help me and I might as well go home"". He said, I didn't say that"". But I said, ""if you can't help me isn't that what you mean?' And he said, ""i guess so."" I was so upset. I went home not knowing what to do. I then looked at the original computer and saw the Geek Squad Icon on the desktop. This computer had no tax prgrm icons on it either since they reloaded that computer also. I opened the Icon on old computer seeing the tax prgrms among others. I was happy till I opened the prgrms and saw there were no returns on it. Now, I'm really upset. I go back to the new computer looking thru many files as I can to find the geek squad info, icon or something. I found the words in a file geeksquad. I right clicked and got the Icon on desktop. I opened that file I saw the prgrms with no returns on them. After 31 hours I had the tax icons back. I called my softward co and 5 hrs later we got the returns back. A lot more to say",0,1

Best Buy,Exceptionally poor customer service,"Exceptionally poor customer servicePurchase the Harmony Elite remote on 1/31/20. Immediately noticed that the remote would not charge correctly, a result of a faulty electrical cord that connected the base charging station to the outlet. Called both the store and the geek squad (who I paid to both deliver and program - assuming they would check everything to validate it was working correctly). Both phone calls resulted in them pointing to the other to solve my problem. Ultimately I was directed to disassemble EVERYTHING (by Rashida in ""Customer Care"") and return it to a store. I could then schedule another appointment to have someone come out and re-program. Had I waited another three days to call it would have been out of warranty (15 days). Best Buy customer service is horrible. Buy it on Amazon and save yourself a ton of trouble.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy Jacksonville-Not The Best Customer Service,"The Geek Squad guys are for the most part knowledgable and very capable. However, if you have to deal with customer service you may be disappointed. The Geek Squad setup and transferred data from my old computer to my new computer and notified me when the job was completed. Unfortunately, what was not known was that a pickup appointment was necessary. The Squad called to let me know they were finished but said no openings for pickup could be scheduled for several days. And that if I were to pick up the computer on my own (without a schedule) the Geek Squad may not be able to proved the required support even though I had purchased a years worth of computer support. The following day I went to the store and picked up my new computer. The store was virtually empty - the only people in the store were the employees. The Geek Squad rep was friendly and very knowledgeable. The issue was with Customer Support; the rep was rude, arrogant and offered very little support. She simply didn’t want to be bothered and did not attempt to provide any answers to any of my questions. She was negative, simplistic, and verbally aggressive.",0,2
Best Buy,Best buy has policies that prevent…,"Best buy has policies that prevent proper customer service through Geek Squad. After in to the store for a phone repair covered by Geek Squad I was refused assistance on my insurance, unless I was to make an appointment. While standing for 20min, alone. I was repeatedly explained policy how this new system is more efficient and beneficial to the customer. Even though the two appointments did not show, I was still not helped. I made an appointment and spent less than 10 mins being helped. I clearly could have been helped the day before. So I received the replacement phone 2 days later and the phone does not work. I updated every possible update and it still drops calls, I can't be heard will on a call, and cannot connect to the internet. After trying all I could think of I called Best buy for assistance. After going through a phone tree, I was asked if I wanted to wait on the line or receive a call back to avoid being on hold. I received a call back, a representative took my info then transferred me to Geek Squad. I remained on hold for over 45 min. Only to have the call disconnect shorty after the representative answered. The first representative, took my info in case I were disconnected, but no one called back. I called Best Buy again, waited another 15+ minutes to speak to a representative. At that time I was told I can only be helped by going back to the same store that I initially visited. So why leave me on hold for a combined time of over an hour to get nowhere. I asked to speak to a manager and I have been on hold for another 20mins. I give up. I paid $1100 for the phone from them, I pay monthly for the protection, and I paid the deductible.",0,1

Around 80k in sales a month. If you do not hit their sales numbers, you are fired. I quit as I was tired of the kids sitting around chatting, so they will tell you sales does not matter, yet they track your sales for Kudos or rewards. A Product that they make, costs 80% less than you pay for it.They put fake Google Reviews online by Activating Phones and putting in a 5 star rating on the phones they activate. False 5 stars. The door greeter is watching you 24/7 on Camera and not there to say Hi.The more sales you get, the better hours you get. Sales dont matter though. Company runs a sales commission setup without paying the employees. Hired a new CEO who is trying to rebuild a dying company. Amazon has better deals and delivers on its promises. Geek Squad is a joke, literally normal employees with a stupid shirt and fake badge meant for the 1990s.TVs are delivered Sideways on Pallets... and on the backs.

Best Buy,I have been buying Computer equipment…,"I have been buying Computer equipment for 40 years. I needed to update my system last December. I spent 3 months researching it including several trips to Best Buy. I was given good and helpful information by their sales people. After deciding, I ordered the system online after being assured by sales people that that was OK. There the disaster started. I made at least 3 trips to the store to get the order right. Time spent on each trip was at least 1 hour. On one of the trips, I was told I had not ordered all the services I needed to implement my system. I had previously told the order taker that I was an not qualified to undertake an install as I could not install a light bulb. The additional charges added up to about $200. dollars. When the installer came out, he did not completely install my printer. I went back to the store, and after another hours wait was told they would come out in about two days to correct the problem. After a week I went back, and was told because I ordered online, there was poor coordination as a result. But he would update on an expedited basus. I waited another 10 days without any results. I went back to the store and this time did get a date scheduled. Recently, IFound out that I had a coflict with that date an called to reschedule. After waiting a while for a human to answer, I was asked what my problem was and I explained reschedule an installation. He told me to wait and placed me on hold again. After a long delay, I hung up and am writing you to say that my experience with this transaction has been horrible, and I do not plan to extend my service agreement upon renewal. This is the worst experience I have EVER had with a computer purchase.",0,1

If they get one I might get it in a month... if not, I just won’t get it and my order will be automatically cancelled.

Best Buy,Non working Fridge with warranty for more than three months...,"I just want to provide a closure on my previous review written in Feb, 2020 (see below). Best Buy exchanged my Fridge to LG Model LFCC22426S/01. I paid for the price difference and another 3-year warranty. This model doesn't have the outside ice water dispenser, it should minimize the cold air leak into the fridge section problem. The exchange happened at the beginning of March 2020. Just in time for SIP! Can't imagine staying home with a nonworking fridge. I started shopping at Best Buy stores in Minneapolis when I was a graduate student in the early 90s, WILL CONTINUE to SHOP at Best Buy.""I don't even think I want to give Best Buy Service one star, but there are no other selections. We bought a LG Fridge Model LFX21976ST/07 in 2017, and a 3-year warranty with it. Started from Oct 2019, the fridge section began to freeze delicate vegetables like lettuce, mushroom, bell pepper etc. I have endured 8 repair appointments with 3 no shows. Each appointment required 8am to 5pm waiting time window. My vegetables are outside fridge all this time. Last Thursday 1/30/20, I had a confirmed repair appointment, but no one showed up. When I called Bestbuy Service, a representative was very compassionate when I shared my story. He told me that the fridge needed to be replaced since there were so many failed repairs, and he spent 45 minutes while I was on the call to setup the junk out procedures for it. He promised that I would only require to endure one more appointment for a technician to write up a report and provide a RA#. The confirmed appointment is today 2/3/20. I have been waiting at home for the technician to show up since 8 am, and was just told no one will show up today again. When I referred to the representative who helped me setting up the last appointment, no one even knew who he was! If nothing resolves soon, the 3-year warranty will be expired next month... - A very disappointed long term customer""",0,3

I have witnessed Best Buy going downhill over the last few years and will never work with Best Buy again. In recent corporate purchases Best Buy repeatedly shipped to the wrong location, then when we gave up on shipping and scheduled a in store pick up, Best Buy totally screwed that up as wellThis past week I purchased a very expensive TV over the phone speaking with William Holmquist. I had limited time as I was on my way to a business meeting, when called with the model number and simply needed to place the order and schedule the install. This process took 45 minutes. I could have purchased the same TV online on Amazon in 5-minutes. William Holmquist had problems; placing the order, scheduling the install, figuring out what to charge for the install, and taking a credit card over the phone. The process of just taking the credit card took 20 minutes, William Holmquist kept blaming the Best Buy computer system during the entire process. During this long process I noticed that Best Buy had the wrong business address for my company, so I provided the updated address. When I was sent the receipt, I noticed that William Holmquist did not update the address. This entire process of working with Best Buy and William Holmquist was extremely frustrating and is reason enough that I would not order anything from Best Buy again but there was more. During this 40-minute process William Holmquist confirmed the install date to be Saturday February 2nd. On Friday February 1st I received a call from Best Buy to confirm my delivery and install for Wednesday February 5th? When I explained to the representative that I had a firm date of Saturday February 2nd he said well he had nothing and could not do anything about it. I then called William Holmquist again and he once again blamed the Best Buy Computer system. I then asked to speak with a manager and he said his manager Angela Grund did not take calls that I would have to e-mail a explanation and at some point she would respond to the e-mail. Never at any point did anyone from Best Buy accept blame, apologize or offer any solutions other than scheduling another date. Best Buy also has offered no compensation or all of my time that they have wasted. If this is the level of service, you are looking for then you are in good hands with Best Buy. If not, there are a lot of other options and I would avoid working with Best Buy at all cost.",0,1

Everything she said, all high pitched and rapid-fire, sounded more like Chinese than English, and she wouldn't slow down or transfer me to someone I could understand. I did manage to gather that she was telling me to contact the person who had given it to me - the one whose feelings I didn't want to hurt if I was stuck with the item anyway.

It was at the store that I was told I can't cancel the existing order and if I wanted to pickup the watch I had to pay again. I ended up buying the watch from Apple and then returning the watch that finally arrived 24 hours later to Best Buy only to find that they shorted me $5.99 in the return because they applied the previously refunded shipping cost against the product. It took me 2 hours on the phone with 5 different people to get them to understand the issue (basic math is not a job requirement for managers) and now I have to go back to the store again to get the refund (they claim the system will not let them refund the money). Simply put, I have been to the store 3 times over the course of 4 days all because I needed same day shipping. Customer service reps are rude and will not let you talk to management, and the managers are lacking basic skills in mathematics and customer service.

Best Buy,Its all about customer service,"Its all about customer serviceI am reviewing Best Buy in Chico CA, the only store I have had any experience with. My fridge went out during the holidays--Black Friday. in fact, when the crowds are nuts. Absolutely everyone, from the sales guys to the delivery guys, were thorough, answered all my questions, friendly and seem knowledgeable. The sales folks could explain why one fridge might meet my needs more than another one, but didn't add a pressured ""up sell"". The prices were so good I bought a TV. The products are not made by BB, and if there were product issues, all BB can provide is customer service. Several years ago I bought a phone whose battery ran down very fast. The most patient woman in the world helped me file a claim with Samsung and get the phone shipped off for repair under the warranty. The waits to get to a clerk can be a little tiring, so picking the right timer is advised. This review lost a star for the computer sales (and computer peripherals). I am not young (over 40), and the young guys in the Computer section can be a little condescending. They are right. They know more than I do. Ignorance is not stupidity. I catch on quickly. Geek Squad gets, I am sure, a lot of questions and I understand why their patience can run short. I just wish that would not happen just as it is my turn.",0,4

Best Buy,Bad Customer Service,"Bad Customer ServiceI needed to upgrade my cell phone and went to Best Buy to see what they offered. I was talked into a Samsung S10e phone with Sprint as the carrier. I did research the phone and checked coverage for Sprint at my home witch their web site rated at excellent. Once home the phone showed 3 to 4 bars for reception, should be good. After a couple of days I noticed I wasn't receiving all calls, the caller would hear the phone ringing and eventually go to voice mail even though the phone would not ring at all to alert me. Once a message was left, I would get a notification (bell) that a message was left. That's how I found out the phone was not working properly. I spent half a day with Sprint (online) and could not get it resolved. Was told to go to a Sprint store and all they did was look at the phone and change some settings. 4 times I went back to Best Buy to get this resolved and only on the 4th trip did they say Sprint has bad reception in this area and they cancelled my Sprint contract and got the phone unlocked. I told them I would go to a different carrier and they told me the phone would work fine with the new carrier. I left and was told by the new carrier that phone would not work. I had to buy a new phone. I take the S10e back to Best Buy and get into an argument with supervisor Elizabeth over the return because she can tell it's not the phone's fault. She is charging me $49.95 restocking fee. I don't care what the problem is, they recommended these products and it did not work and they could not fix it. Something else they forgot to tell me was by cancelling Sprint so I could unlock my phone I lost my phone number I've had for 20 years. They got their 50. bucks but lost a customer and I will convince every one I can to not shop at Vero Beach Best Buy",0,1

The manager was rude and dismissive. Would not even look at the laptop. I wil do whatever I can to spread the word about their failure as a company including public notices and complaint lines.

Best Buy,Duped by best buy,"In early November 2019 I purchased a new laptop at the recommendation of a young man who worked in the geek squad at best buy. The laptop was an HP Laptop 15-DY0013DX. Since purchasing the item I have had to return to best buy three times. That is three times in a little over two months. The laptop is not an item I use everyday. On the contrary, I use it every couple of weeks due to my schedule. Yet each time the machine freezes and will not let me log out or go to a different page or application. When the machine is not freezing it opens a different page as the home page even though I have set google as my home page. The first time I went to best buy i was told that it was a fluke that the laptop froze. The young man corrected the home default page so that it would open to google. He also put the chrome icon on my desktop since it could not be inserted to the shortcut bar at the bottom of the page. Why, I do not know because there was no explanation as to why the computer would not open in chrome or allow for the icon to be posted to the task bar. A few weeks later, I returned because the computer would not accept the wifi at my house and it froze. The gentleman at geek squad desk was able to get it to function and had to reset the default page on the internet to google because the internet would open to several different pages in one sitting such as bing and yahoo. Again no understanding as to why the machine froze and of course it did not freeze while at the store. Today the laptop froze again, and again there was no idea as to why a brand new laptop would freeze. The gentleman at the store tried to be helpful but could not explain why it froze and went on to try and sell me coverage for the software. $200.00 for one year and he could send it out to see why the machine froze. This is a brand new laptop it should not freeze while being used. Again he had to reset my home default page because it would not open to google. Yahoo was the preferred page today. Worse, he explained to me that had i returned my laptop before the 14th of January it would have been replaced with a new laptop. So in the meantime I have a brand new laptop that is garbage because it does not work. No one in my previous two visits to best buy thought to tell me that I could return the damaged machine for a new one. I am told today on my third visit and I believe that I was told only because the time to return the garbage product has expired. Yet, best buy was trying hard to sell me their $200.00 software coverage. I do not know who is taking advantage of me more best buy or HP. This garbage laptop should be replaced with a new one. It is hard to believe that a new laptop barely used to cause so much headache and frustration. I have not visited a best buy store so often as I have in the last two months. I have been duped by best buy and HP. Beware, if purchasing an HP laptop and the geek squads lack of disclosing the ability to return a new damaged laptop until the return period expired.",0,1

Best Buy,TCL Roku Tv,"I bought the tv from a big box retailer and had to return the first one because the threading on the screws was off and the stand would not attach properly to the tv. This should have been my first warning that the quality control was subpar.This tv was replaced because it was brand new. I proceeded to set it up and was initially impressed enough to buy an entertainment center and the Roku speakers. Fast forward 15 months. I'm watching the tv and it cuts off and will not turn back on. I tried some troubleshooting and then called customer support. They took me through the same steps without success. At the end of the call I was informed the tv was out of warranty and my best bet was to sell it for parts to a local TV repair shop. So now I have a setup including the entertainment center, external speakers and tv that I have over $2000 invested in and not a lot to show for it. This is unacceptable and I would advise others to stay away from this brand until their quality control standards improve drastically. Roku is a quality company but their partner TCL needs to step it up. I say that because when I tell others of my experience they think this is a Roku problem and I have to explain that the built in Roku and speakers would work if the TCL tv would power on. The TCL components make the Roku components worthless.",0,5

Best Buy,The Worst Customer Service Experience of My Life!,"I have an ongoing horror story with Best Buy. I was in the market for a new tv for a while. Just before the holidays, I had one of the BB home consultants to my house to review my situation. I have a surround sound system wired through the walls and I wanted to make sure they could install a new tv and connect everything to a new stereo receiver and DVD player. The consultant recommended the tv for the job and, since I do not have an HDMI cable wired through the wall, he said a wireless HDMI would work great. Shortly after that, I visited the story and picked out a tv and set up an installation time. Everything has gone wrong since. Best Buy only gives you an eight hour window for its visits, until the day before the scheduled visit, when they narrow it down to a few hours. This is inconvenient from the start as more lead time is needed for planning than half a day. On the day of my installation, the technicIan showed up and right away he had an issue. He started talking about how the wireless HDMI I purchased (which was selected by Best Buy’s consultant) wasn’t right and would not do the job. I was very disappointed as the holidays were coming and they obviously would not be able to reschedule for a while. We called the initial sales consultant again and he instructed the technician to install the tv with the existing HDMI, knowing there would be some glitches, and we would change to a wired approach with an Ethernet line and another device I’d have to purchase (video balun). It took all day for the technician to install plus another visit to the store to buy a new wall mount because mine didn’t work. Just after the technician left, the tv started exhibiting all sorts of glitches. The wireless HDMI would spontaneously disconnect, the sound and picture would get out of sync, the expensive remote control would seemingly do nothing and the stereo receiver didn’t work well with any of it. On top of that, my speakers which were already mounted in wall were not functioning properly (don’t even know if this is BB’s fault).I had to call Best Buy back the next day and report the problems. After going through the voice prompt system, this is no easy task. I got ahold of the installation technician and he stated he thought there would be problems and that I really needed that video balun. After some additional effort to get in touch with the sales consultant, we agreed again to order the balun and it could be installed after the holidays. I agreed to be patient with the glitches until then. After the holidays, I heard nothing from anyone about the status of my order. I had to, again, make multiple calls to Best Buy and finally got in touch with the sales consultant again. He behaved as if we had never had the initial conversation, asking me what the problem was exactly. It was obvious he had not even ordered the video balun as of yet. He ordered it over the phone and took my credit card information again, charging me $200 for the device. We set up another appointment to finish the installation, which was yesterday. Again, the only timeframe I was given was between noon and 8 p.m.. I never received a message providing a more narrow time. I waited all day and heard nothing. I finally started trying to get in touch with Best Buy customer service again, and that was a nightmare. Nobody at their toll-free number knew anything and I encountered some rude employees during this process. At one point, I was told they needed to transfer me to another part of the store and I was put on hold for 20 minutes before finally hanging up. Finally, I was told the situation was escalated and, again, nobody could really tell me where the technician was exactly. Even BB management could not reach him. Finally, towards the end of the evening, I received a call from the technician (a new one who did not perform the initial install) and he was trying to tell me he couldn’t get there that day, but could come the following morning. He said he’d pick up the tv and bring it by. I said, “Pick up the tv? No, I already have a tv, you were supposed to finish the installation and install a video balun to allow me to avoid using a wireless HDMI. He was absolutely clueless about this and said there was nothing in the notes about it. He indicated this happens a lot. Part of the problem is the installers are third parties and they’re only paid for what’s in the order, nothing else. He was to follow up and get back to me. I never heard from him again.It has now been a month since that initial installation and I’m still dealing with an expensive tv that doesn’t work quite right. I paid additional for a video balun that is not installed. Every time I try to call Best Buy, I get nowhere on the phone. People at the store are either clueless, rude or just don’t really care. My initial sales representative, who organized the whole thing, is AWOL. I would never recommend Best Buy for anything like this again. This has been the worst customer service experience of my lifetime and it’s not even over. I’m going to have to visit the store in person again and find a manager, or anyone who can provide help. I dread that. Best Buy is horrible.",0,1

We have not had a fridge in over a week now. They took our new fridge back to the warehouse (they planned on leaving both in our small kitchen, neither working). Nothing can be done now until the fridge is checked in there. The whole process is ridiculous. Why did Customer Service not warn us of everything we needed to do before they came?

They did make an exception for us and give us store credit, but they did their best to make us feel badly about it. I know it’s corporate policy and not the poor sales clerk’s fault, so I feel it’s unfair for the company to put the poor employees in the position of having to be the bad guys.

Best Buy,Same disastrous experience as others,"Same disastrous, dare I say more disastrous, story as other customers of Best Buy. My elderly mother bought two top of the line dishwashers to be delivered on the same day and installed in two locations about a mile apart. They showed up with one dishwasher for one location. Receipt clearly indicated same day delivery for both. Rescheduled two weeks out for the other, then they cancelled and pushed it back another two weeks. When they finally arrived, we had an installer, but no dishwasher. Same old “blah, blah, blah” from the installer, “thought the dishwasher was already here”. My mother and wife spent all afternoon at the store where the purchase was made (Niles, Ohio) after waiting all morning for the installer who was empty handed. Store manager (corporate) assured them he would get to the bottom of it and contact one of them by the end of the day, already being late afternoon by then. After a week went by without hearing anything at all from anyone, I spent over ninety minutes on the phone trying to get in contact with someone, anyone! Several hours combined on phone, mostly on hold or being transferred around. Eventually made arrangements to go back to store to get delivery straightened out at which time they gave us $100 off for inconvenience (back to that in a minute). Rescheduled another week out between seven a.m. and noon. Of course no one showed up at all. Started calling again at one in afternoon. After all that inconvenience, I was informed I would have to make another trip back to the store (fourth trip now). At that point it was four in the afternoon and I just asked for a refund as we’d given them all the time under the sun to get the job done. It was then that they arranged for a refund by mail MINUS the $100 off for the inconvenience that they were TAKING BACK. We had spent three full days waiting on our own time not even including hours and hours on the phone, and still never even got the product.Mind you, this was a nearly two thousand dollar dishwasher (2) order that was already paid for in advance. Absolute and total bungling and incompetence from top to bottom! Would never ever consider buying anything from Best Buy ever again! I would rather pay a few bucks extra for a legitimate company and no headaches. It defies logic that this is one of the top retailers in the country. Worst customer service ever, and I am over a half century old and have dealt with my share of poor service. This takes the cake though. I would encourage any consumer to look elsewhere for your purchases. Keep in mind that Best Buy doesn’t sell anything you can’t get somewhere else. Save yourself the grief and keep in mind that Best Buy could care less! If I could rank with zero stars they would get a minus ten.",0,1

Best Buy,Don't go to Best Buy,"Don't go to Best Buy, especially the one on Arden Way - Sacramento. They advertise price match, and it dangerous to shop there.

When I shown to the sale man the ads, he said oh, no way, it got to be mistake, the price can't be right, it can't be that low. I called Fry's, and they confirmed the price was correct, but the Best Buy sale man refused to price match it. He just kept saying Fry's price was wrong. I told him to call, he refused. I then said, your ads for price match is a lure for customer, I called the store and I was told you do price match, but because you think Fry's price was wrong you refuse to price match and you even refuse to call them to confirm, that's all I said, then here is the scary part. As I started working out, another sale man approach me, he was about 15 feet away from me with nothing in between, as he was going to attack me. I quickly walked away/out, he still take a few steps toward me, his face looks like he was offended or something. To be honest, this guy had traumatized me by the way he talks, the way he approach me. By the way, he looks like middle east people (muslim?)",0,1
Best Buy,Buyer BEWARE!! Best Buy is really “Worst Buy”,"Buyer BEWARE!!! Do NOT buy an appliance from this company unless you’re installing appliance yourself. Otherwise, I guarantee Best Buy’s installation subcontactor, XPO Logistics is going to cost you valuable time and cause you frustration like you’ve never experienced before. Bought a top of line $1100 Bosch dishwasher from Best Buy in November ‘19. Installers, XPO Logistics, not only caused a leak under my kitchen sink upon installing dishwasher, but they also left me a lemon of a dishwasher since they didnt bother checking out it’s operation prior to hastily leaving. Attempt at rectifying bad situation has literally been like pulling teeth. After weeks of complaining & ataying on top of Best Buy, finally got them to send me a new dishwasher. Unfortunately, given XPO is their only delivery & installation company her locally in the Beavercreeek, OH area, another young, inexperienced, unprofessional crew from XPO shows up with my new Bosch. Unfortunately, they tell me the previous installers improperly installed my dishwasher, and therefore, there was absolutely no way they could remove the defective one without someone taking up the floor tile directly in front of the dishwasher. They said I’d need to take care of the tile work and could reschedule delivery when finished/ready. I told them that was unacceptable, and that aince it was their company that installed the diahwasher, it was up to them to get it out. Then they tell me they’re not allowed to do tile work, and that my only option was to remove the tile myself and then reschedule them to come back out. At this point, I just want their dumb, unprofessional a$$es out of my house and just tell them to uload the new dishwasher and I’d take care of everything myself. They say OK, asked me where I wanted dishwasher left (I say in my dining room), walk out the front door, start up their truck and just LEAVE. No explanation, no replacement dishwasher on my front porch, no clue as to what just happened, no nothing:-( Multiple calles to my local Best Buy store went unanswered, and calls to their 1-800 customer service line resulted in being placed on eternal hold every time and getting the complete runaround. So needless to say, I’ve still got a defective dishwasher in my kitchen that thankfully does at least work occasionally. Will never, EVER step foot inside this shady company’s front doors.Absolute worst customer service experience I’ve had in my entire 50 year lifetime.

Best Buy,I shopped Best Buy for the first time…and horrible refund experience,"I shopped Best Buy for the first time and customer service was rotten service for my refund experience. I am extremely upset😡. I returned an item on 1/4/2020 for a refund. They say it will take 3 to 5 business day, well,I still haven’t received my refund yet, it’s 1/11/2020 and nothing. Plus, I paid with a debit card which it’s also used like cash. Why not hand me the cash and get on with life 🙄 I’m not ever going to shop there anymore. Now I see why I shop at fry’s, which I also return stuff and next day my refund is in the bank. What a sour experience.This place is at s Gessner and 59 . Houston Texas",0,1
Best Buy,Absolutely the worst,Absolutely the worst. If you can find any other place to purchase the item you're looking for... Do it. Their customer service is abominable. It's like a bunch of children who don't know how to do business nor how to handle customers.Every time I need help with something I purchased at Best Buy... it's unprofessional and hands off on the part of Best Buy. I feel like I'm dealing with a bunch of children Who don't know how to take care of business. It says there's expert Service as I'm listening to the robo phone right now at Best Buy... There's nothing expert about it. I spoke to Mel who was going to email the manager and CC me on the email to call me because I'm very sick and cannot get to the store on time to return within the return period. That was an hour ago and I never received any email. Mel did not honor her word and follow through. Then I called the store back. Customer service person by the name of Dago answers. I asked for a manager. She asked me what the problem is... I tell her... She tells me to call 888-237-8289. I had already spoken to them 2 times. They told me that they can only help with online orders and this was an in-store purchase ...and I just keep going in this circle with these people over and over and over and over again. I'm too sick to even go into the whole story this way. I need to speak to someone who is a professional and knows how to handle business and take care of this ... and understands what real customer service really is.I avoid Best Buy because of the awful experiences I have nearly EVERY TIME I purchased from them. And here I am again feeling the same way about this company. There's a reason why their reviews are so bad. They need some ethical business professionals in there ... and they're nowhere to be found. Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe the magnitude of bad experience. And as I said this is not the first time. The consistency of bad experience is outrageous. I find it interesting that they have so many people employed in their stores who stand there and welcome you at the door vs taking care of you the way a professional company takes care people.,0,1

Best Buy,Order appliances over a month ago,"Ordered appliances over a month ago. They use the worst delivery company in Harvey Louisiana. Dumb delivery guy unpacked my $4000 refrigerator with hub screen in the rain then got mad when asked to cover it up. Then the dummy rocked the fridge hard to a hand truck denting it all up. Best Buy has scheduled me 3 more times had me wait at home only to find out my order was not loaded even sending me constant emails and texts” we are on our way arriving in 30 minutes etc” don’t shop Best Buy they don’t care. Now I have to wait in a refund check in mail that they won’t even have the correct name on because I abbreviate my name on my account even though I paid with a check with my full name. They have a geek squad and couldn’t correct this so says one of the managers. More craziness. I also like to add I’ve spent at least $15,000 in best over the last two years cash and this the treatment. Wow!!!",0,1
Best Buy,i had the worst shopping experience…,i had the worst shopping experience with best buy as I had gone to the store to buy an iphone 11 Pro max but since they dint have one they convinced me to have it shipped. When it was shipped the package was damaged. Somebody had stolen the phone but left the ear phone and charger. Best buy Customer service online and store associate started playing games by not resolving the issue but trying to blame me as if I was responsible. I have spent thousand of dollars as I'm an elite customer but this is the last time I will ever do business with them. When i was finally able to file a claim with best buy l was told after 48 hours that best buy wont replace or refund but instead to file a claim with UPS or go to law enforcement agency. Now after all that I tried to contact UPS and learnt you guys have some stupid SOP with UPS trying to trick innocent customers. When you try to file a claim by putting the tracking number on UPS website or call their CS team but i was turned down multiple times. This is because as a customer who bought their stuff from best buy you can't directly file a claim with UPS unless the shipper initiates that. Even after calling best buy and informing them about what i was seeing on UPS website or talking them they continuously denied and said to reach to UPS. NEVER EVER DOING BUSINESS AGAIN WITH A COMPANY WHO HARASSES THEIR CUSTOMER FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IN MY CONTROL. For me to go to LAW enforcement i need some kind of IMEI Number but you guys wont even provide me that information,0,1
Best Buy,Just shop at Amazon and save yourself some hassle,"I ordered a toaster oven on Jan 1. Their site said it was in stock. Supposed to be delivered Jan 8. This is Jan 9, no toaster. Tracking still said it was in transit but UPS shows they never got it from BB. I called BB and their very English-impaired agent said I should be able to get one around the end of January; I have to assume they advertised something they didn't have. I opted for a refund. After giving me the refund for the toaster oven, she had to transfer me to another agent for a refund of the ""protection plan"" I bought. All told, they cost me over a week waiting for the toaster oven and then about a half-hour sitting on hold or saying, ""What?"" because I couldn't understand what she was trying to tell me.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy has the worst customer service ever in the history of customer service,"I ordered an elliptical on 12/2. Delivery was canceled on 12/31 and rescheduled for 1/7. I took off work during the time frame it was to be delivered. No one called. No one came. After several calls to Best Buy, it was rescheduled for 1/8. I took off work again. No one called. No one came. EIGHT frustrating phone calls later, with clueless employees telling me it should be at my house ""soon,"" I reached a lady who asked me to verify my address. I did. She said it was the wrong address. Uh - no it wasn't. She said if I couldn't verify my correct address, Best Buy would have to cancel the order. I told her my address was correct. She put me on hold, and while on hold, she canceled my order. When she came back to me, she said it was my fault because I could not verify my correct address. I hung up, thinking I must have somehow given Best Buy the wrong address when I placed the order. But then I found my original order, and NOPE. I gave them my correct address. It clearly and accurately appeared on the order form. I called back and was told Best Buy could not reinstate the order or honor it because it had been canceled. It did not matter that it was canceled by Best Buy due to their own stupid error. Not only that, but I was told the elliptical was on back order and wasn't coming anyway yesterday. SERIOUSLY? This is the worst customer experience I have ever had with any company ever.",0,1

The second time they didn’t even tell me it was cancelled, they just never showed up. I called their customer service line and they refused to make good on the delivery. They also refused to give me a refund so I can’t go somewhere else to buy a tv. They also refused to reschedule my delivery until they get the tv back to their warehouse, after arbitrarily deciding to not deliver it. They also refused to let me speak to a manger, saying I have to wait for them to call me. Truly a frustrating experience.",0,1

They say “pack up the product, send it back to the manufacturer” even when it’s under warranty.Don’t wast your money buying through Magnolia, other than throwing away $2000 for installation of a single TV, there was no reason for me to buy from them. Sound bar popped and stopped working under warranty and they said “we don’t do home service”.I have spent tens of thousands of dollars at Best Buy and I will never buy from them again.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy completely screwed us over,"Best Buy completely screwed us over. Bought a brand new washing machine less than 6 months ago that is now flooding the laundry room when in use. Called Best Buy who flippantly told me that after 90 days it's not their problem. No apology, no customer service, just an integrity depleted response. Now I'm paying out more money for a repairman to come fix a problem that should not even be occurring in a brand new washer. Never again will I set foot in a Best Buy store, they don't deserve ours or anyone else's hard earned money. Shameful, greed.",0,1

By the end of December it kept saying order processing. When I called, they couldn’t find my order. 30 min later he found the order, and told me they didn’t have the item. I had to go to the store on the day of stocking with the hope that they would have it. When I explained the situation, the kid at the counter stated, with a strongly condescending tone that they would not simply honor the order, which was not explained to me on the phone, and that I would have to make a whole new purchased for the same item, cancelling the previous order, and now running up my card balance until they decided to reimburse me. He couldn’t event tell me how long the reimbursement would take. I made the new purchased. The kid held his condescending demeanor through the rest of the transaction, stating that there would be a restocking fee if I returned it, using the following tone “AND it does not matter why you opened it, of you return it, you will be charged for it. No exception! I explained that I would only bring it back if it was defective. I am not impress with the staff, their of communication, and attitude.",0,2

Best Buy,Don't trust BEST BUY insurance plans,"They had a great deal running for Black Friday on Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. My wife and I both got one. My wife also opted for the monthly insurance plan through Geek Squad since she has a history of cracking her phones. Sure enough 6 weeks later she cracked it. No problem we have insurance, go to Best Buy Geek Squad. We schedule an appointment, drive all the way across town to be told they can't fix it. They don't have the parts. They can only fix Note 8 or 9. But they can replace it for $200! Why are you selling an insurance plan for a product that you don't have parts for or know when or if your contract with Samsung will get renewed? I ask if there is another Samsung Care dealer in the area (I already knew there was) Geek Squad tells me, ""not for 300 miles"". A bold faced lie.I drove to UBreakIfix about 15 minutes away who is partnered with Samsung Care. They had the parts in stock and fixed for less than $90. Great sales, horrible service!",0,1
Best Buy,I purchased a dishwasher with Best Buy,"I purchased a dishwasher with installation on 12/31/19. I have spent the past week trying to schedule an appointment. The online scheduling does not work. The phone lines had an 45 minute wait. I finally was able to connect through chat. The representative told me the item had been order and the warehouse was awaiting arrival and the contractor would contact me for installation. However, I have continued to get messages from BB about making an appointment. I finally got through to the service center. The lady who assisted me did not listen to anything I told her. She did not check the notes on the account for prior contact. She immediately assumed I wanted a repair appointment. I again explained why I was calling. She finally set up an appointment. February 21. I’m seriously thinking of canceling the order. I’ve dealt with them before in Georgia. Was hoping for better here in Michigan. We have limited choices for appliances here.

Best Buy,Best Buy - false advertisement regarding “gift receipts” issued with Xmas gifts - refuses to allow gift to be returned for store credit,"Best Buy, College Station. TX. My daughter received an Xbox Live subscription on an Xbox card bought at a Best Buy off Gulf Freeway in Houston, TX for an Xmas gift (12/25/19). With this gift she received a “gift receipt” stating the item bought (Xbox card) and price paid. My daughter already has an Xbox Live subscription so on 1/6/20 we took the “gift receipt” and the brand new (security code intact and not scratched off) to Best Buy In College Station for a store credit so that she may purchase another item for Xmas. The store manager refused to return the Xbox Live subscription card stating Best Buy never gives a return on those items purchased. I pointed out that we have a “gift receipt” which stated items bought can be returned for a store credit. The manager stated he “can issue a “gift receipt” on anything bought - it doesn’t mean the item can be brought back for a store credit”.

Best Buy,Best Buy Online Sucks,"I'm not the type of guy to go out of my way to leave a terrible review for a company or a brand, but I will waste 10 mins of my time to talk about this most recent experience with Best Buy. I'll save you time if you're here looking at weather or not you should order a big ticket item from Best Buy online. The answer is simply - NO. Best Buy is one of the worst companies to order from online. In store they will make some concessions and obviously they'll probably have what you want/need on sight. Online though you're better off with Amazon or another reputable electronic retailer. Case and point- I ordered a drone recently for a trip. As I'm placing the order the website says that the drone will be to me by the 3rd (which was perfect). Upon placing the order the delivery date changed to the 7th. Not OK since I'll already be out of the country. Long story short- I contact what they call chat support to ask what they can to do help me out. The girl says she cannot do anything. I ask her HOW I can cancel if needed. She cancels my order.... They're in Philippines!! There's a language barrier, now I've lost my order, I've lost my credits. It's ridiculous.. I'll never do business with Best Buy again online. Long story short... Stick to Amazon or a company who knows what they're doing with online retail.",0,1

I received an email stating that it would be received on the 23rd. Great! Just in time for Christmas. The only thing that went smoothly in this order is the part where they took my $349.98.I received an email from Best Buy (12/19) informing me that the product had shipped and was provided a USPS tracking number. For several days I checked in on the order and USPS had not received the item. Looking back at the Best Buy email, the only info they provided was that “pre shipment details” had been sent to the USPS on the 17th.Flash forward to December 26th and I call customer service. This is where things get very irritating. Woman (Sandra) hardly speaks English (no surprise) informs me that they can’t give me a refund and that they would ship another pair of headphones, I demand a refund and she said I would receive it in 2-5 business days. I politely requested an email receipt for this refund and she said I would have one within 24 hours. Great!Saturday 12/28 - “where’s my refund email receipt?” Khoobe Bryan (poor English speaker) of Best Buy says they cannot give receipts because the order is “under investigation”. I tell him that’s not my problem that they’re investigating their lost product. “Okay sir you will get a receipt shortly”Thursday 01/02 - “it’s been 2-5 business days, where’s my refund?” Criza of Best Buy says, “we cannot process your refund of $349.98 because we’re still investigating this lost item and we don’t want to lose money on this purchase”. I asked her what she meant by that and whether or not I would bare the burden financially of their incompetence in shipping products. She couldn’t and didn’t answer my question. Asked to speak to a supervisor, she told me their supervisor was busy but I told her I would wait. 30 mins later she told me the queue is “too lengthy for you” and that I would just have to be patient.",0,1

Best Buy,Abysmal customer service,"What has happened to customer service? When did corporations decide that it’s totally acceptable to be disrespectful to their customers and to not value customer loyalty? I have purchased three TV’s from Best Buy and I buy all of my smaller electronic accessories from Best Buy as they are close to my house. Customer service has always seemed fine, of course I have never asked them to do more than just take my money at the register. After my most recent online experience with Best Buy I will never purchase anything from them again, and I would strongly recommend that you avoid this abomination of a company at all costs. Go to Target, Costco, Amazon, the closed down radio shack, anywhere but Best Buy! I purchased a NordicTrack S15i from them online. A soon as I placed the order, issues with the delivery started. I called customer service multiple times. Spoke to Jamie the first time and Christine the second. It was overwhelmingly clear from both conversations that their job is not customer service, but how do I make this customer go away. I mentioned to Jaime that I was going to write this and he became very excited. Told me his last name and seemed ecstatic that I would mention it as if it was some sort of badge of honor. When I spoke to Christine she had the very same attitude and seemed excited when I told her that I want to cancel the order, and just buy it somewhere else. It was as if knowing that a customer had been lost and was going to shop with a competitor was a job well done. I don’t really have an issue with the purchase, as I understand items go on backorder and become discontinued. Spending a month dealing all of this was not fun, but I’m flabbergasted with the level of disrespect I received from Best Buy customer service.",0,1
Best Buy,Don't count on 'Price Match Guaranty',"Made a purchase and received a $50.00 complimentary gift card as a purchase incentive. Three days later, the item went down $30.00 and I asked for and was approved the refund. 6 weeks later I went on a chat line and asked when it would arrive. They said it was now denied due to the gift card and 'they' cut off the chat when I tried to protest. I should have been informed about the denial without asking. Best Buy will lose a lot more than $30.00 for this screw job. I'll shop elsewhere in the future. I really have a hard time with big stores taking advantage of the 'little guy'",0,1
Best Buy,Why we are done doing business with “Best Buy”,"My family has been doing with Best Buy for many years now, spending literally thousands of dollars with the company. I have heard my wife on more than one occasion, recommending to our friends to try calling Best Buy, especially for their price guarantee. Unfortunately, after dealing with their “Geek Squad” for the past ten days we are done and will be taking our business elsewhere.First off, the “Geek Squad” has always been difficult to deal with, especially their smug attitude whenever you ask them for assistance. Apparently Best Buy management has lost all control over their customer service unit.On 12/19/2019, we called Best Buy (Geek Squad) to come out and repair my mother-in-law’s washing machine. This unit was purchased on December 6th, 2017 and covered by an extended warranty, which as we have come to discover, is nothing more than a third-party insurance policy. The “service technician” arrived on 12/20/2019 and while attempting to make repairs, broke the part he was trying to remove. The service technician said a new part would arrive in two days and that, and I quote, “we could install it ourselves”. To-date, the ONLY part that has been received is a small screw sent by Sears, addressed to my deceased father-in-law. Why it was sent to him and was from Sears has yet to be been explained.On 12/27/2019 @ 6:56pm, my wife called Geek Squad for an update on the repairs. The person she spoke with was extremely rude and told her she would have to wait for service. When she asked to speak to his supervisor, she was told the supervisor would not help her. When she insisted, he told her they would call back. We she asked for his name, he hung up! Let me just say at this point, that ANY person who hangs up on a customer for whatever reason, regardless of whether or not “junior” is having a bad day, was late for his break or needed refresh on his cocoa-mocha latte, this person SHOULD BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY. I am sure that won’t happen because “junior” is a just a sensitive employee who was having a bad day and needed a few moments alone in his safe room before having to deal with all the annoying, ignorant customers. This is COMPLETE, TOTAL, BS!!!My wife called back four times on each occasion she was hung up on again. On the fifth attempt (@ 7:02), a person named Saad answered and transferred her back to the main menu. At 7:19 Joe answered and transferred her again. At 7:29 a person named Angie answered and proceeded to tell my wife that “we had no warranty except for the manufacturer warranty, that Geek Squad doesn’t do repairs, however they would send someone out to do diagnostics”. What???? Now remember, this was already AFTER a technician had been sent out for repairs. Angie then told my wife that there was nothing they could do and that it was our problem.To be honest, it was at this point we started to feel like we were living out a part in the movie Rainmaker. We purchased goods from what we thought was a reputable company. As part of that purchase, we were sold an extended warranty that states very plainly on the invoice “5-year Standard Geek Squad Protection”. NOWHERE does it say we are actually selling you a “Great Benefits” extended warranty, that the company is in Texas, and you will have to deal with them!!!!What I EXPECT is that when I need repairs, I call Geek Squad, schedule an appointment and repairs are then made in a timely manner. I EXPECT to speak with courteous, respectful REPRESENTATIVES of the company, NOT some snarky little kid what thinks that since he is way smarter than you, you are only entitled to replies he thinks you can comprehend. Just for the record, I have been in IT for thirty-five years, the last fifteen of those in a senior position at a Fortune 500 company. For the record, smart-assed little know-it-alls last about five minutes in the support business, no matter how “sensitive” they are. IMO - They are better suited flipping burgers at McDonalds.I see now that my anger over this matter is extending to what I write. Let’s just end this with the following:Dealing with third party support is NOT ACCEPTABLE; since Best Buy has completely forgotten what customer service AND support is all about, we are done! Going forward, we will be making our purchases elsewhere. As for recommending Best Buy to others…not a chance.",0,1
Best Buy,On-line ordering,"I ordered my Laptop on line. The ad said I could pick it up at store in a few days or have it delivered TOMORROW to my home. I chose the latter. BIG MISTAKE. ""Tomorrow"" turned into ""whenever we get around to it"". Every delivery estimate notification I've gotten has a different date. If Best Buy isn't worried about Amazon - they should be. I will NEVER EVER order anything on line from Best Buy ever again. I've learned my lesson. I'm could have gotten same unit from Amazon for cheaper and most likely SOONER.",0,2
Best Buy,Defective 75 inch Samsung QLED series 7 TV,Purchased a new Samsung 75 inch QLED series 7 TV in July of 2018 and regretfully didn’t purchase extended warranty. A few weeks ago we got line on the screen and within a few hours the tv wouldn’t come on anymore. Call Samsung and they have us a service company to call and they came out for 150 dollars to tell us we needed a new cable and one connect box. When they returned neither one fixed the issue so he proceeded to take tv apart and then told us we needed a new panel and wrote a quote for 1800 dollars which we told him we were thru with the repair route. Thankfully they didn’t charge another trip charge. I have tried to get help from Best Buy and Samsung to see about a generous discount on purchasing a new tv but unfortunately it has been a miserable experience trying to find someone at either company that would get me with the right person to show empathy for our situation. We have been huge fans of both Best Buy and Samsung but their lack of care has been very disappointing. I have already changed my phone back to I phone will be replacing all my Samsung products with other brands in the future and I will not be purchasing anything else from Best Buy. I will purchase my new TV from Costco as they double the manufacturer warranties and are always wanting to take care of their customers.,0,1
Best Buy,Credit card refund,"Never again. The geek squad operates out of Panama and has no ability to resolve payment issues.

First and last time dealing with Best Buy.",0,1
Best Buy,DO NOT ORDER APPLIANCES FROM BEST BUY,"DO NOT ORDER APPLIANCES FROM BEST BUY. We ordered a refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher. So far we're 0/3 in getting what we ordered delivered when scheduled. The freezer? Available when we ordered it then ON the delivery date the delivery driver called to say that the item was suddenly ""backordered."" The refrigerator? An hour after the delivery window had elapsed we received an AUTOMATED message saying that they needed to reschedule the delivery and asking us to either go online or call them back. Unbelievable. At this rate we have very little confidence that the dishwasher will be delivered at the agreed upon time and date. We will NOT be ordering appliances from Best Buy in the future, no matter how appealing their prices or sales. So far our experience with Home Depot has been better (delivered the washer/dryer we ordered during the specified delivery window). Avoid Best Buy like the plague--at least as far as ordering appliances.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy rewards THEFT by returning stolen items with no receipt for store credit!,"I will never shop at Best Buy ever again! For the first time I ordered two sets of Beats headphones on Black Friday. Then on Cyber Monday I found them for $50 cheaper at Target so I decided to return the ones I purchased online from Best Buy. The first pair arrived on 12/5 and I took them in store on 12/6 and returned them and they put the refund bs k on my credit card. There was no receipt in the box since now the shipping label is now the receipt so brought in my e-mail receipt. The second pair kept getting delayed. It wasn’t until Christmas that we realized the second pair was stolen off our porch and the thief took them into the Best Buy store with no receipt, no confirmation e-mail, just the box with my name on the shipping label and Best Buy gave the thief $162 of store credit! They didn’t even put it back on my card! And when I went into the store, the manager says they return items for store credit “all the time” with NO paperwork! Best Buy Corporate did nothing! Best Buy is encouraging theft and fraud! Please please please do not buy anything online at Best Buy!!",0,1
Best Buy,Absolutely TERRIBLE service here and I…,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service here and I wish I had read the hundreds of bad reviews about customer service about this store before I purchased anything here. They scam you to get money by processing things when they say they are checking something before letting you know what the adjustments are. I'm not sure of the name but the guy who helped me out, the one with the pink/purple hair , basically told me he would check for me if I could return something that was part of a bundle and went ahead and processed the return without explaining the explicit terms and what the final amount would end up being. It so happened to be that I had to end up paying money for something that I had returned because of their prices going up. If informed about this, I would not have returned the item as I would be losing money that way and I don't think anyone in their right mind would've returned it. Therefore it seems that I had basically been tricked into paying for something as I had not consented this return. Extremely bad customer service, and sales representatives seem to have a know it all attitude with no consideration for the CUSTOMER. On top of this they have the audacity to argue that they have explained whatever information needed to be communicated to the customer, without doing so. If you are looking for a bad customer service experience, lack of explanation and sensitivity to a customers need and arrogant sales representatives, please go here!",0,1

Also, if they do not deliver as promised / scheduled, you only have the right to return or cancel the item. Also calling geek squad is useless.

My nightmare continued when i tried to get help on the phone with each agent interested in telling what they can not do after holding on for an hour. At the end after almost two waited hours i did not return my item for credit. I am a so-called ELITE card member. In short, I will close my Elite membership and stop shopping at Best Buy.

Took TV to Best Buy, they said there was ""impact damage"" on TV. I have no idea what happened. The young fella that helped me get it into store helped me take it back out because Best Buy refused to do anything for us. I was told if we had the insurance on the TV it would be covered. Insurance was never offered, according to my husband they were more interested in signing him up for Sling & donating to St Jude, which he did both. I called Corporate, now that was a waste of time, as they have outsourced to a foreign country that offered zero help. We plan to cut up card & never shop there again. Now we pay on a very expensive TV, sitting in a box that we cannot use. They should have offered the insurance when my husband went through check out so we could have protected our investment. The people that I talked to were very dismissive & abrasive. My husband went to Walmart, got cheaper TV & one of the first things they offered him was a 3 yr warranty for $59.99, which will cover any and all damages or defects, Now that is customer service.

Best Buy,"Adventures Into Computing, Chapter One:","I sat alone in the quiet thrill of the morning, relishing the gleam of the shiny new Solid State Drive delivered from the jolly fat man 'neath the glow of flickering colored lights. As my talents run more towards pairing the perfect glass of wine - and bashing those who think that wind causes cancer with my rapier wit - instead of IT shenanigans, I placed a call to my highly-paid Geek Squad to get some pointers on installation. When my qualified, expert agent finally answered, I was provoked with the joyful holiday question: ""what's a Solid State Drive""? As I drew a breath while contemplating a smiling answer, I was gifted with a resounding Click.Keeping Best Buyian hope alive, I placed another call to my conveniently-placed local store (whose website says opens at 8am, whose Facebook page says 9am, and whose outgoing phone message says 10am) and, after my 10:01am,15-minute hold to speak with a live human, found one who greeted me with the cheerful (honest to God): ""Best Buy. Whaddya want???"", which, of course, set the holiday mood for the rest of the conversation. ""Ma'am,"" I replied, finding it difficult to do so between clenched teeth and a tongue bitten nearly in half. ""I have a new solid state drive and I'd like to speak to someone in the Geek Squad department about installation, please,"" hopeful for a spec of jen-you-wine pleasantness and basic intelligence. ""I duno what that is and they're busy, so call back in 45 minutes,"" came the earnest reply, followed by my second Click of the morning.Geek-Squad-trained professionalism: 2. Your hero: 0.",0,2

Best Buy,These incompetent group of morons…NOT BEST ANYTHING!,"These incompetent group of morons managed to screw up an online TV order. Four days late I wasn't able to cancel it they just dropped it off at the door without a signature. I advised I wasn't going to be home four days later and they said that it needs to be signed for, so I said no problem, I won't be there and to take it back... they dropped a $400 TV outside my front door and left it there without a signature. SHAME!! NEVER AGAIN SHOP AT ""WAY LESS THAN"" BEST BUY.. WHAT A JOKE!",0,1
Best Buy,I ordered some appliances for my mom…,I ordered some appliances for my mom for Christmas to replace the ones that got messed up. I did the 2 day delivery the Friday before Christmas. The then emailed me at 12:18 am Sunday to tell me it's going to take longer than expected. Bestbuy is the worse they had no problem taking the money out of my account for their products. I called them and all I got was sorry I just have to wait till it gets here.,0,1
Best Buy,I wish I'd looked at this page before…Worst Buy ever,"I wish I'd looked at this page before placing an order for an iPad and case as a Christmas present for my mother. Best Buy's customer service is a nightmare. I live in the UK and contacted their Web Chat service before placing the order on 17/12/2019, which was to be delivered to a US address. At no time during that discussion was the company policy of placing an authorisation charge for 2-3 days after completing the order on one's card ever mentioned. I paid for the order with a bank debit card--not a credit card--and funds were transferred from my account almost immediately. The first I knew of the double charge was when I checked my balance online 3 days later and found that not only had the funds been taken (and by that time the order had also been delivered), but there was an additional pending charge for virtually the same amount. I spent half an hour speaking to my bank to try to work out why Best Buy was billing twice and was advised to speak to the company. After getting nowhere with Best Buy's Web Chat operative after 45 minutes I was given a telephone number to ring--bear in mind this is an international call, so the 58 minutes I spent explaining to the Best Buy Customer Service team was an extremely expensive additional aggravation, particularly being constantly kept on hold while the matter was referred to the shift supervisor whose sole input seemed to be ""don't worry, we won't actually take the money from your account, it's just an authorisation charge."" Neither one could explain why the pending charge was still applied to my debit card 5 days after Best Buy had already receiving payment in full, nor did they have any sensible response to the fact that there is now just 1 working day left before banks close in the UK until 27/12/2019, and unless the charge is rescinded immediately I will have no time or available funds to do any of my Christmas shopping. When I was advised to ""call back tomorrow"" I just hit the roof. They ended up taking the telephone number of my bank--I had to explain that there is a 6 hour time difference so there was little point in ringing then--by that time it was 2.30am our time!!!! I have registered a written complaint with Best Buy and have noted the additional cost of telephone calls as their responsibility. If it were possible to give a rating of zero stars that's exactly what I would have given Best Buy.",0,1

Best Buy,Such horrible service!,Such horrible service!! I have been on the phone for over 40 mins and have gotten absolutely nowhere. The women I am talking to has no idea what she is doing. I tried to change my shipping method to get a gift in time for Christmas and she cancelled my order and told me she could not do that. Now my credit card has been charged twice for over $750 and I have to replace the order myself. Why would my card be charged twice you ask...she doesn't know and told me to call my bank. I am still on hold waiting to talk to someone who can help me. UPDATE: The customer service rep hung up on me after placing me on hold for another 10 mins. I hope Best Buy monitors their phone calls. Now it is 4 days until Christmas and I have over $1500 held on my credit card and a cancelled order. Thanks Best Buy. My call was made between 12:30 and 1:30 on 12/22/19.,0,1

Best Buy,Extremely disappointed with Best Buy,"Extremely disappointed with Best Buy. I decided to place a pick up in store order so I didn’t have to drive a half hour to the location and them possibly not have the item. The website showed the location having it in stock, as soon as I placed my order they cancelled it. Wouldn’t be so aggravated, but clearly the system knows they don’t have it and still advertised they had it. My card was processed so now I have to wait for the refund to go back into my account. I will never use their pick up in store option again",0,1
Best Buy,Horrible service,Horrible service. Received a gift today and tried to return to a store. They would not take it and told me that Best Buy website is not the same as a Best Buy store! Told me to call customer service and they would ‘arrange for a FedEx pickup’. Nope. Lugged the heavy sound bar home and called. The phone drone told me that only the purchaser can send the item back. The purchaser is out of state and now we are stuck. Why won’t they take their own unopened merchandise back? They’ll be out of business soon.,0,1

Best Buy,Unlocked phones are actually locked.,"I bought an unlocked Samsung S10 from Best buy - South Beach Miami Store. I used without a problem in United States before moving to Australia. When I tried to use a local company (Optus) I found out for my surprise that the phone is actually locked to US Carriers only. I paid the full price for an unlocked version, the sales person never told me that I would not be able to use it internationally. I since called other carriers in Australia, Samsung USA, Samsung Australia, went on different forums and complaints websites and no one seems to know how to fix the problem. I then went back to best buy mobile support and they said it was writen on the website ""Carrier Compability: AT&T, Boost Mobile, Cricket, H20 Wireles, MetroPCS, Mint Mobile, Net10, Simple Mobile, Sprint, T-Mobile, Tracfone, TotalWireless, Verizon"". The person I spoke on the phone actually told me to use ""Rooting"" (jailbreak for Samsung) which I found completely unacceptable to believe that someone from Best Buy was telling me to do something considered by many to be illegal and I could potentially destroy my phone doing so. My thoughts on this are, I bought the phone in store and did not read anything online before purchasing. I paid full amount for the phone to be unlocked as I knew I would probably have to use it internationally and could not afford to be stuck to one carrier. This practice is perhaps the most absurd marketing strategy I have ever heard of. It should in fact be illegal. Also, I were a customer that buys a few thousand dollars worth of products from Best Buy every year. If this is the way Best Buy treats customers like me, I can only imagine what they do to people that goes there for one purchase alone. I would appreciate any help from them as I have this U$1000 phone seating in my house without been able to use it for quite some time now. I dont believe this is in any way my fault. I pay the full price on an item that I should be able to use it and no one is taking responsibility for it. However I have lost my faith in this company after seeing how many bad reviews they have.",0,1
Best Buy,Rob Hewitt - How Best Buy ruined Christmas,"I ordered a Mavic Mini drone on 12/2 with delivery scheduled for 12/12. On 12/9 I found out that no one would be home and didn’t want ‘porch pirates’ to pick it up instead, so I switched to in-store pickup. Instead of taking my package a mile up the road, they postponed the pickup date 1 week to 12/19. On 12/19, I received an email that the product is delayed. I called the Geek Squad and they said it would not be available until 12/31. I cancelled the order.In short, switching from delivery to in-store pickup 3 days before delivery meant that I couldn’t get my son’s gift until more than 4 weeks after purchase.Evidently Best Buy cannot handle December demand and doesn’t deserve the customers they have. They have lost my family as customers for life. To all consumers, Happy Holidays at any of their competitors that have MUCH better customer service.",0,1

Best Buy,Delivery and Availability are not real,"Delivery and Availability are not real. of all the choices on the web and even all the choices available on the bestbuy.com website i purchase a particular model because it was availble for delivery for a particular day/time that worked for my schedule. when the refigerator was not delivered on the available day/time i called Geek Squad and got a Devana Jones. aside from devana jones' attitude, the bottom line is bestbuy does not guarantee a date/time - they simply reschedule you for another date/time or offer to return your money. and bestbuy doesn't email you or call you to notify you they will missed the contracted delivery date/time. so if you expect to have an appliance delivered on a particular day i would not use bestbuy as they dont honor the date as i understood the term of sale to be.",0,1

He apparently wanted to get off early, must have pulled up in front of my condo took a picture and then left saying I wasn’t home. We have a concierge- he never wLked into my building. Customer service at Best Buy is the worst. Would never ever buy from them again. Took talking to 3 people to only find out I can’t even reschedule till the following day. Worst customer service",0,1
Best Buy,TALK TO SOMEONE WHILE YOU CAN... you'll not get another chance.,"I am giving Best Buy a ONE star. I'd give them a ZERO if I could. It's so not right that they are such a big company yet they make positively sure it is extremely difficult to speak with someone about any issue unless you walk into their store and CORNER THEM. And don't let their pre-recorded prompts tell you, ""Hey, you're lucky, you get to save lots of time and go to our online chat for help!"" Guess what? IT'S A CHAT BOT that can't make sense of sentences or respond to you correctly, so it will end up giving you the phone number to call them!!!!!!! Are you people really so unsuccessful that you don't have a dedicated customer service team or if you do have one you are hiding it very well! Bought Samsung - 7.5 cu. ft. Capacity FlexDry; Electric Dryer - Fingerprint Resistant Black Stainless Steel and when it was installed, the guy said I couldn't get the one thing I bought the thing for and that is for the STEAM setting. He said you DIDN'T BUY THE PART OR THE SERVICE! I said, ""Who in the crap sells a machine WITHOUT all the parts????? OR at least doesn't tell someone during the purchase, there is more to buy??? "" His response wasn't to help me fix the problem, but ""Hey, I'm like the pizza delivery guy. If you didn't get tomatoes on the pizza, I can't do anything about it."" I asked, are you going to help me get this taken care of? He said, no you will have to.... bla bla bla. So in other words, I will have to call someone and remain on hold for who knows how long. He started shaking his head yes, before I even finished my sentence because he KNEW what a pain in the assss it is to try to get Best Buy to help you and he KNEW there was no team for that. Don't try to tell me the team is the GEEK squad. They are NOT and they are JUST AS HARD TO GET IN TOUCH WITH.So I call the store on delivery day. On hold for 1/2 hour. Get someone who says, ""hold for appliances"". Someone picks up again and hangs up the phone. Call back and ON HOLD for another 1/2 hour. The guy makes sure I get to appliances this time. Appliances says, ""you have to call resolutions"". I call resolutions. On hold for 15 minutes. Get a nice woman who has no answers. I tell her my problem and I was told call customer resolutions. She says, ""Oh, okay, I'll transfer you over there"". WHAT THE HECK???? This wasn't even the resolutions number??? Somehow, I get hung up on again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Call back. On hold for whatever! Get a nice man and immediately ask for customer resolutions. His answer: ""Well, did you look at the link at the bottom of the page that says, 'people also purchased'""? WHAT DOES IT MATTER??????????? Your asking me that does nothing at all for me and who looks at that????? That is also on Amazon and half the time they want to sell you a lawn mower with a slip and slide! JUST INCLUDE THE NEEDED ITEMS WITH THE PURCHASE. So, after a $10,000.00 purchase, no real help at all. I have to go back online, make a purchase and schedule another visit. For that much of a purchase and for this much trouble, someone should have been doing BACK-FLIPS to get my steam setting working!!!!!",0,1

I call them and the automated machine said my order is not found, I waited for 30 minutes to speak to an agent and still no one pickup. Now the next day, still no message about my item being ready. I cancelled the order and I got a message right away indicating my item is cancelled. It's like they don't want my business. Going back to Amazon, much more reliable.",0,2
Best Buy,two canceled deliveries!! from best buy,"DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FOR DELIVERY FROM BEST BUY - this is our second bad experience and now I know better!! first was an over that took 6 weeks and was cancelled 3 times on their end - meanwhile we did not have an over during that time!!this time - We ordered a refrigerator online on 11-30 and had a zero balance Best Buy credit card that we placed it on. They pre-confirmed the order, so when the order actually was placed it showed we did not have enough credit and canceled the order but not the charge - so they said they would take the charge off and told us to reorder. So we ordered it again and the delivery was scheduled for 12-14 from 8-12:00. The driver called the night before to confirm we would be the second stop. (we were leaving town that day just after install) The delivery guy called us at 10 am on delivery day to say it was not on the truck and therefore we would have to call the store?After numerous calls to stores, corporate, the best buy credit card...it now shows delivery on the 23rd, yet the charge from the first order is still on the card and they want a payment on January 1st!! I cannot get any confirmation that it will arrive on Monday but the window is from 12-pm?!?

It also said that there were a few at my, nearby BB in Mechanicsburg, PA. So I went in to look at and purchase. I have purchased thousands of dollars of items over the years, so I didn't expect any issues. Well, I had a crazy and frustrating experience at the store. Yes, the same product was there, but at a much higher price. No one at the store or even calling their, customer service, could explain the disparity and difference in the online price on Google and the store price. I think this is dishonest and misleading. I will not deal with Best Buy in the future. Other sites do a lot better job of policing their sellers. From reading their reviews, obviously Best Buy, doesn't or worse, don't care!",0,1

We cannot be there in person, so we hired our property manager, and paid her an extra hundred dollars to be there for the delivery. When the item showed up it was damaged. They took our other dishwasher away before assessing the damage to the new one. They said a new one would be here today, 12/19. Our renter checks in tomorrow.Now they are saying there is no dishwasher. It is not in the warehouse. And we have a big gaping hole because they already took the other one away. And they are now saying that the new one will be here on 26 December. While my renter is staying there. They don’t know where the dishwasher is that was to be delivered today. And I have no real faith that there really will be one delivered on the 26th. Yet they took our other dishwasher. So now our Renter will arrive to a big gaping hole. So we have paid our property manager $100. And Our renter wants a credit as well. We will see what happens on the 26, but thus far, this has been a terrible experience. In the past we have dealt with Home Depot or Lowe’s and there has never been a problem.",0,1
Best Buy,Bestbuy online vs store disconnect?,"The store had this ""12 days of deals"" event which included getting your items by Christmas. So as a bb guy, I faithfully spent a few hours looking for ""deals"". I bought about 5 items and was also ""lucky"" to get the main attraction- a discounted 55"" TV! Their site indicated that the nearby store had all those items so I chose to pick them up there. Next day I received notification the items were ready...all but the much advertised discounted 55"" TV! Apparently they were having a hard time fulfilling that order due to unavailability. The same TV was still showing as available at the same store but with a lesser discount! At first the message was they would try to fulfill soonest, then hours later message changed to fulfilling within a month and of course if unable, they'd cancel the TV order. I thought it was a mistake since the website still indicated the store had it! Then I goggled around and discovered this was a trend/pattern bb uses, with possible cancellation as the end result. Looking at the whole picture, it now appears to me as a scam in the making. Can't believe I fell for their ""sale"" trick. I will probably wait it out just to see if it will play out as predicted before cancelling. Still shocked big store like bb can stoop this low so shame on you for wasting a customers’ time and misleading with flashy “sales” when you can’t keep your end of the bargainUPDATE: Day after this review, message came that the TV was now available for pick up. Unfortunately, after their I had already found an alternative . The company needs to fix the disconnect between Bestbuy online and the stores. Customers shouldn't suffer because their inept internal processes.",0,1

I go into the store, wait in line and was informed “Item is coming from our warehouse in Atlanta. It should be here no later than Saturday.” Original purchase date was 12/12 on a Thursday. Saturday comes, no email. Sign in and check status. Preparing for delivery Tuesday. Tuesday evening I check email and find that my order is still processing. Unsure of delivery date. Now keep in mind this was initially an online purchase for same day in store pick up. Their inventory showed multiple items in stock. I call 888-BEST-BUY, at this point I want to cancel my order due to crunch time with Christmas being 7 days away. I am informed it will take up to 7 business days for funds to be returned to my debit card. I then get transferred to Escalation department only to be told that at this point of my order that it CANNOT be cancelled. I demand to speak to a supervisor. “The supervisor uses the system system I do, they won’t be able to cancel order either.” I replied “So, you are telling me that I’m unable to cancel my order?” The representative states “no”. I inform him that somebody somewhere can cancel my order. He then asks me to hold on. When he returns he states he was able to cancel my order. Throughout this entire process I have the option to cancel online. But since I’ve been on the phone for 45 mins I figured they could press the same button that I would’ve had I cancelled myself. I know this time of year gets busy and I try to remain mindful of that. HOWEVER, THIS WAS AN ONLINE IN-STORE PICK UP PURCHASE. I was able to successfully purchase the item from another company and I will NEVER use Best Buy online purchasing again. The only reason I gave 1 star was because I had to.

And now I can’t even cancel and do a in store pick up because of the hold on my card. This is ridiculous and I will never order from them again. The whole reason I made the order is because it was a next day delivery...... the notice I got from BestBuy is that if the product is not shipped by 1/16/20 then they would cancel the order.

So I called customer service. I explained to him what happened. He put me hold several times and told me that they have plum and he could order that. I knew he was listening to what I said. So I asked to speak to a supervisor. He told me she is only going to tell you want I told you. After he converses with the supervisor, she gets on the phone being rude and not listening. I tried to explain to her that color needed to be changed. She was so incredibly rude, I asked for the manager. I explained to her how rude the first 2 associates and explained what the issue was. She told me that she couldn't change the color nor could she contact warehouse to make them aware. She could only cancel the order. So I told her to cancel the order and she could not do that. Then she told me I was not charged. I told her yes I was. She said that was an authorization. I told her that amount had already been taken off my card. She said that was a soft charge. So I told her to cancel it and she could not. She told me that she was providing me options. When she told me she could only cancel the order, only to find out she could not do that. I asked for her name. She said ""L Y N"" (with an attitude). So I dealt with these people telling me I made the mistake (which I did not). I had to order over the phone with them for it to be correct, unnecessary attitudes and disrespect, telling lies of what they could do, only to find out that could do nothing and I have wanted an hour of my time! Horrible customer service and bad management. This makes the entire company look bad! It definitely made me question if I wanted to continue my business there.",0,1
Best Buy,What is happening to our country and what is Best Buy thinking?,"Went into store this AM to buy gift for spouse. Asked young man at the door where I might find the item and to please have someone there to help me. He directed me about 30"" to rt of front door. Another young man who was very pleasant helped me with my purchase placing the closed box in one of their bags. I was in site of the man at the front door the entire time. I took my purchase and walked directly back to the front door. Entire time in store was less than 10"". When I got there he told me I needed to show him my receipt to leave. I left the store after digging the receipt for over $300 for one small item out of the bottom of my bag. Outside I stopped on the sidewalk and decided enough is enough; I was NOT going to let Best Buy ruin my holiday spirit. I returned the item and noticed a person in civilian clothes step up to my left to ""shop"". As I turned around to leave, I noticed 3 more men there in civilian clothes with no coats even though it was 33 and rainy out. Hello, we are talking a 67 year old little old lady with a leg brace who never even raised her voice and wished the girl at customer service a great holiday season. At least it explained why she was ""busy"" with something and wouldn't wait on me until everyone was in position. What is my country I served coming to and what are the chances of me EVER giving Best Buy. I went to a competitor and bought the exact same item for the same $$. Shame on Best Buy!!",0,2
Best Buy,BEST BUY DOESN'T CARE  ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS,"BE CAREFUL SINCE THEY CAN CALL THE POLICE TO WALK YOU OUT FROM THE STORE WHILE TRYING TO BUY!!!!Just wanted to aware Bestbuy's customers in regards of what happened to myself while trying to buy 3 items at BestBuy's Indiana Store! In the comments, you will be able to see their response.Please read my email sent to the BestBuy Team:""I should report a problem that occurred in one of the Best Buy stores in Indiana, I decided to copy all of you. However, I apologize for those of you that are not responsible for the issue described as follows.Unfortunately, I am reporting a regrettable situation that occurred at a Best Buy store in Lafayette, IN, on November 29th, 2019.It was around 08:00 PM when I arrived at the store with my father and my sister to purchase an HP laptop that was on sale due to the Black Friday deals. The salesperson who helped me was very nice and kind. I also decided to purchase a JBL headphone for my husband and an Apple AirPods with Charging Case for myself.This salesperson took me to the Geek Squad check out line,where the cashier would help me to check out and give me the Apple headphone. Again, I want to highlight that the cashier was also very nice and kind at all times. After he scanned all the items, I noticed that the Apple AirPods with Charging Case was $139.00 at Best Buy and $129.00 at Walmart. I asked if it was possible to match the price only for this product since it was a $10.00 difference. He told me that his manager did not allow him to price-match because they were different products. However, I checked both part numbers, and they were exactly the same. Therefore, I kindly asked him to call his manager because I wanted to discuss this issue with her.After some minutes, Ms. Shalina Gramman (Geek Squad Manager) arrived, and without even greeting me, she yelled at me, saying that she could not price-match because the products were not the same. I tried to say that the part numbers were the same because I had the Apple box in my hand, and the Walmart website opened on my iPhone. She yelled at me, repeating that she could not price-match and presented me two options: I could purchase the product at Best Buy for $139.00 or leave the store without buying anything at all. Then she just left. We were all surprised by her attitude because she is a manager.Not satisfied with her attitude, we decided to walk after her, so that she could better explain the situation. She said that she would not talk to us about that anymore and period. Right after, she gave us her business card and asked us to call the 1-800 number and complain about her if we werenot satisfied. We got then even more surprised by her attitude.When we were about to finalize the transaction, Ms. Shalina Gramman showed up again, she switched with the cashier that was helping us, and told us that she was going to check us out. We told her that we didn’t want to check out with her because she was very rude and didn’t want to explain about the price match. She once again yelled at us, saying that we had to check out with her, or we should leave the store; otherwise, she would call the police, which she indeed did.A few minutes later, three police officers arrived,and she asked them to kick us out of the store. I tried to explain to the police officers what was going on, but they replied, saying that by law, she could refuse to sell a product and that we had to leave the store immediately; otherwise, we were going to be arrested.Following the police order, we left the store without purchasing the products. We felt very humiliated by that awkward situation. We left the store with three police officers behind us as if we were outlaws trying to steal something from the store. We felt even more embarrassed because the store was full of customers due to the Black Friday deals. When we left the store, we noticedshe was laughing behind us.Considering the above; I would like to know what is the position of the company regarding:1.​The poor customer service provided byMs. Shalina Gramman, who did not have enough emotional balance to deal with the situation, getting out of her control, behaving in a hostile manner, and leading me to embarrassment and humiliation.2.​The fact that I was not able to take advantage of the Black Friday discount due to this situation.Best regards,Renata Brissi""Here's their response:""Hello Renata,Thank you for contacting Best Buy regarding your experience at our store in Lafayette, IN. One of my colleagues, Steven, replied to you via email on Tuesday, 12/3 and I'm sorry if you did not receive his response. Steven is now out of the office, and I will be taking over this case. We value customer feedback as it allows us to review areas of opportunity and improve our processes and procedures so we may better assist you. Please know your comments have be made available to management for review and future training, however, outcome will remain confidential.We have investigated the issues in your correspondence with store management, and they noted the price match was declined as our Price Match Guarantee does not cover items for sale the Sunday before Thanksgiving through the Monday after Thanksgiving, whether offered by Best Buy or a competitor. Full details our our Price Match Guarantee can be found here. Please let me know if you have questions. Thank you again for contacting us.Kind regardsKathryn""And I have replied to this email:""Hello Kathryn,I am very unsatisfied and disappointed with your response!Did you read all my complaints carefully before replying to my email? To remind you, my father, my sister, and I have been kicked out of the store by three police officers while trying to BUY in one of your stores.The store manager, Ms. Shalina Gramman, should have explained me exactly what you explained regarding the price match policy, and none of this would have happened. This type of situation is unacceptable! It shows that BestBuy is not investing in training its employees. I never thought I would go through such an embarrassing and humiliating situation as this one I experienced at one of the Best Buy stores and I was just trying to complete my purchase!We were treated as robbers! Can you understand the seriousness of that situation? You, as a Senior Executive Resolution Specialist, just sent that vague email apologizing, and you think that it is enough? No, it is not! I could have accepted this explanation while I was at the store last week. However, now, after a week has passed, I want a formal letter and reparation for this embarrassing situation. This formal letter must include all the plans showing that BestBuy cares about their customers and that you will provide better training for your employees. I want to know all the actions that will be taken. You can use Starbucks as an example. That company cares about their customers! If you are not aware of the case, here is the link: (link omitted)I want to know what the BestBuy’s position as a company will be because I did not accept only the below email as an apology. It simply does not explain the terrible way that Ms. Shalina Gramman treat me that day. Therefore, I deserve a reparation from BestBuy and a better resolution for this case! I look forward to hearing from you soon!Regards,Renata Brissi""And their response, once more, was ridiculous:""Hello Renata,I apologize if my email upset you further as that was not my intention.Best Buy takes allegations like these very seriously, and management has been made aware of this experience. As with any of our internal investigations, the details and outcome will remain confidential and will not be released. Best Buy does not provide compensation nor reparations from a customer service standpoint for poor experiences, lost wages/time, gas money, etc, and we respectfully decline your request.Best Buy will not be responding to further correspondence on this issue and we consider the matter closed.Kind regards,Kathryn""",0,1
Best Buy,We purchased a Washer and Dryer,"We purchased a Washer and Dryer on December 9th. Had a scheduled delivery date for Saturday December 14th between 7am-1pm EST.On Friday December 13th, we got our Two Hour window which was from 11am-1pm. The Delivery Driver never showed up. We called at 2pm to talk to a agent to find out where our washer and dryer were. They said they were on the phone with them and would call us back when they got a estimated time. NEVER got a call back. We Called back to Best Buy at 330pm, they called the driver and said they were an hour or an hour and a half out. We had other arrangements so we waiting around for them to show and they never did. The delivery driver finally called us at 5pm to let us know that they were on their way and it would be about 30 mins. By that point we couldn’t wait anymore, we had prior arrangements that night. We called first thing in the morning (Sunday morning December 15)to talk to an agent. We talked to a lady, wasn’t able to catch her name, who reached out to the Field manager on call to try to get our washer and Dryer delivered to us First thing Monday morning. They scheduled us for Tuesday just for precaution, just so we can be in the system. We waited around for a couple of hours with out a call back. We Called back around 1:30pm-2pm to find out the status, only to find out it was still pending. At this point we are getting frustrated. 4:30pm-5pm rolls around and we still didn’t hear anything. Again we call them back to find out. Now we are talking to Brandon, he was very sorry and even handled me yelling at him professionally. He supposedly tried to contact the on call field manager Vanessa again. With out surprise she didn’t answer. What field manager who is on call all day doesn’t check their emails or calls/voicemails? Brandon tried to contact the Home Service Manager Richard with out any luck. Monday morning, we called at 8:30am, which we talked to an agent to get us transferred to a supervisor/manger. In order for us to talk to a manager we had to give the whole story again to an agent. When the Manager Rachel got on the phone she pretty much told us that there wasn’t anything she could do due to it being the holidays. I explained that their delivery driver messed up and their store is doing absolutely nothing to make the situation better. That we should have been the first stop on Sunday or Monday morning. Since they never showed up. Again she said Because of the holidays we won’t bump anyone because of the holiday and if I called corporate they would tell us the same thing as and we would have to wait. Her attitude Infuriated me, it was the attitude of I don’t care. We ordered our Washer and Dryer from Home Depot and switched to Best Buy because we could get them sooner. We have been with out a washer and dryer for three weeks. The laundromat isn’t cheap. To be told that for the inconvenience that they won’t do anything until the Washer and Dryer are delivered. The customer service department at Best Buy in Bradenton Florida, is one of the worst services I’ve experienced. Anyone other Stores would apologize and make sure we were top priority. After all they messed up.No one wanted to give me Names if Managers, District Manager, Or they just didn’t know who they were. Unable to provide a name or phone number to the delivery company.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy is the wrong name for this box store,"Best Buy - customer service on the phone is a joke. I expect someone to be in charge but all the people can do is say back the same thing the previous person said. I then tried chat. The ""person"" said that there are no tracking numbers for expedited shipping... really? The he was positive I was going to get my shipment in time for Christmas. That the Jan 14th date is the random date they give for anything that has a delay. Then he says once I get it after Christmas I can return it to the store... really.. after Christmas. I ordered this on Dec. 2nd.. nothing saying they were not in stock or on back order... So Yes. I did expect to get it prior to Christmas.",0,1

Best Buy,I'm leaving a review because I am so…,"I'm leaving a review because I am so unhappy with how Best Buy shipped my item. I ordered a HoMedics neck massager for my husband for Christmas and it arrived yesterday. They just slapped the shipping label right on the HoMedics box, so it's obvious what it is, plus since it had no protection, arrived scuffed up, slightly dented and in rough shape. I wanted to post photos but don't see how I can. I would've thought Best Buy would put things in a box for shipping..especially around the holidays. My husband brought the package in, so this gift won't be a surprise. I guess I just expected more from Best Buy.",0,2
Best Buy,Never again will I order for delivery…,"Never again will I order for delivery from Best Buy. I purchase a 43"" tv online on a Wednesday, was told delivery would be Thursday, then Friday, then Saturday. All of these day I made arrangement for it's arrival. Today, Monday I get an email stating it had arrived. I am still 3hrs from arriving home, if it's gone, the card charge will be refuted. Either way buying online with Best Buy will never happen again. Oh, contacting them via phone, or email, you will never get a reply. People, I do hope you read these reviews, they are real!!!",0,1
Best Buy,Probably last time having to deal with them,"I ordered during cyber Monday and got nice price hoping I will have it for Christmas for my daughter with guaranteed delivery by December 24th. After 2 weeks I'm getting ""Your order has been canceled"", one week before Christmas. Called customer service and passed two escalated levels. Explanation from customer service was that they needed 2 weeks to check all stores for ordered item. Ridiculous!Also some lady (represented herself as highest in hierarchy to complain about) added that it is very possible this to happen because of high demand and advised me to do multiple purchases for next Hollidays to increase chances to get any delivered.Now I have to spend $100 more because today’s price is significantly higher than it was. Other retailers where offering similar price on the day of order and I chose BestBuy, but no more!",0,1
Best Buy,no customer care,"I ordered well in advance (more than 20 days) and paid, a gift for Christmas.guaranteed delivery by December 24th.Not seeing an update or shipment, I decided to contact the customer service who told me not to worry, that he had sold out, but having ordered it when it was available, I would certainly have received it in 2 days.After 2 days contact again the assistance, which instead of confirming what was said by the colleague, sends me an email with CANCELED ORDER. thank you and goodbye.All this for a week after Christmas.Now, apart from the fact that this gift now costs almost $ 500 to buy in this period, I will receive a refund in 10 working days and so it is impossible for me to have it now.And it was the only thing my daughter had asked to have for Christmas.",0,1

Best Buy,AWFUL DELIVERY SYSTEM. DO NOT USE.,"Received a call from Best Buy this morning informing me that the TV I purchased for delivery the night before would not be delivered. The lady told me that they didn't even have that item in stock, so why their system even allowed me to go thru with the purchase in the first place is beyond me. According to the worker, the online system will tell you anything is in-stock if it's in a store near you, but won't check if it's available at the store fulfilling the actual delivery (which, in this instance, was all the way in another state). DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THEM IF YOU WANT TO KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOUR ITEM WILL BE AVAILABLE. When I asked her to cancel/refund my order she told me I had to do it myself. When I attempted to do so, the system wouldn't even let me click the ""cancel or change order"" button because ""We are currently working on your order so we cannot make changes/cancellations at this time."" Had to be on the phone with customer service for 45 mins to get my refund, they tried to tell me to just purchase another one in-store without refunding me properly. Awful experience, will never be purchasing anything from here again.",0,1

Best Buy,Beware of Poor Customer Service,"My husband and I tried to purchase 5 of these online this morning 12/13 for Christmas presents. Each Google Nest Hub was supposed to include a free Google Net Mini 2nd Generation with Google Assistant. However, when we tried to order >1, it only showed one free Google Net Mini so I had to order them individually. After ordering 3, we were given an error that we had reached our max. We were logged in to my husband's account so I decided to try purchasing as a guest. No luck, it recognized my email address. I tried ordering the last two using my work email. It appeared to be successful but then Best Buy cancelled them. My husband spent several hours talking to customer service. He was told they thought it was fraud and that there was a limit of 3 per person. I called and asked to speak with management because MY HUSBAND AND I ARE SEPARATE PEOPLE. If the limit is 3 per person we should be able to order 6. All I got was a run around. Beware of Best Buy. They have 0 customer service.",0,1
Best Buy,Zero customer support,"I bought a keyboard on Black Friday, Nov 29th. It is now Dec 13th and I'm still waiting for the keyboard. I'm not in a hurry so I wasn't alarmed it was delayed a few days. Its now been longer than a few days.Best Buy has no customer service team to contact. I work for a living, so I can't sit on hold on the phone all day hoping to talk to someone. Their live chat never works. Their customer service team doesn't even use email. Its 2019 and their webstore doesn't use email!As of today, Dec 13th, I'm still out the money and there's no keyboard in sight. This was a Christmas present purchased nearly a month in advance. No Christmas present, zero customer service, and they're keeping my money, too. Miserable experience.I regret ever trying to buy anything from them. I should have bought it from Newegg or Amazon instead.",0,1

Best Buy,Bullied and Scammed by Best Buy,"If it was possible to give them no stars I would. I called 1-888-237-8289 after receiving an email this morning from Best Buy stating that my order was delayed, and that it would show up before January 11th, today is December 13th. According the purchase I would have it next day, it was purchased 12th. Called support to see if what the delay was, and if it was possible for me to pick it up. I was told by John employee ID#1482487 from the Philippines office that all I could do is wait. The carrier had not come, and he was unsure of when they come to pick up my order for delivery. Due to it already being labeled for shipping the option for pick was off the table. He have no idea when the carrier would come. He did not have any options for me nor could he do the following:1.) Cancel the order 2.) Provide me with a supervisor, because he was swamped on the call I waited over 2 hours to speak to a supervisor by the name Jimmy (employee ID#1482774) who never cameThis was a gift for my military husband who is leaving tomorrow. The size and time of when the gift was the reason for the purchase. Due to pregnancy I choose shipping instead of pick up. However, after receiving the email I was willing to pay for my own local delivery then to wait for an aloof carrier that that Best Buy seem to know little about when it comes to their scheduling. In addition to this, the staff themselves are very unsympathetic to the situation. After reading several different reviews posted it seems to have become an everyday practice of bad business when it comes to some of the Best Buy business practices currently being utilized. I for one will not be shopping with any business that makes me fill bullied. Beware you have no options once Best Buy has your money, you can only wait!!!",0,1
Best Buy,I purchased 2 items on black friday for…,"I purchased 2 items on black friday for xmas presents, an apple watch and a hover board. The watch was refurbished and stated that it would come in original packaging or equivalent. Never knew apple packaged their watches in an oversized cardboard box without even some bubble wrap to protect it from damage. The hover board was even a more pleasant experience. a week after purchase I contacted the seller as the purchase had yet to be processed. They answered that they have received high volume of orders but assured me I would get my product before xmas. Today they cancelled my order, now no one has it in stock and no attempt to help me locate a suitable replacement. Should have ordered it through Amazon, when they had a few remaining left in stock. Best Buy lets third party sellers use their name for a cut because people believe they can trust it but does nothing to govern how the sellers do business. I should have read these reviews before hand.",0,1

Best Buy,I needed a product the same day and…,"I needed a product the same day and needed to pick it up at Best Buy during my short lunch break. Therefore, I ordered it online for one hour pick up. The receipt even stated it would be available in one hour. Also, the latest commercials even make the same claim. However, when I arrived two hours later and after waiting for 20-minutes at the pickup desk, it was not ready for pickup. The employee told me that the order may not be ready for days as they had over 300 online orders to prepare, but only had one employee assigned to pick them up. I had to cancel my order and go find the product myself. Then I returned and found out that one was working the checkout stand and I had to checkout using the pickup desk again. After another 30-minute wait, I was able to checkout and return to work late. So, Best Buy advertises that for your convenience you can order online and pick up your product in an hour. However, in actuality, it took me almost an hour to get my product myself in the store. I know that Best Buy was in trouble a few years ago and losing money because of poor customer service. Well, it seems that they will be in trouble again because they still have not learned their lesson.",0,1

Best Buy,Cyber Monday fail,"Just like another reviewer, I purchased an open box laptop computer on Cyber Monday. I went to see when it would be delivered and that’s when I realized that they had canceled my order due to not having them in stock. I called 4 times and they hung up on me each time. The one time that I got to my valid point that if it wasn’t in stock then why is it currently in my cart (just no longer at the same price), they gave me radio silence and I sat there for almost 40 minutes like that until they finally hung up. I also tried to live chat with them 5 times but after 5-10 minutes they state the volume of customers is high and I kicks me out. I’m sure they’re having a lot of calls/complaints that are similar. I would’ve looked elsewhere if I had known, but now I missed out on the deals. They truly seem to not care about their customers at all!",0,1

Best Buy,"Deliberately leaves out details online, no customer service at all!","Do not buy online. First, whoever's name is on the billing address is the only person who can pick up Apple products. So even though I bought it as a gift, I could not have that person pick it up. Fine, I told the person it was an early gift and had to use their card! I spent more than two hours and two different chats trying to figure out if the purchase had gone through because while I received an email saying the order was being processed, Best Buy informed me that the purchase is not complete until the trade in has been received at the store. Fine again, I just needed to wait on the email stating when the order was ready. The email didn't come until past noon on the day the order was ready. I informed them on the chat the person had to make transportation arrangements because they are a college student with no vehicle. With barely any notice, the person went to the store only to be told the order was being cancelled because the trade in, while in good working order, had a small scratch. I tried to get on the chat only to be told I was #100 in line and even though I chose to wait, the chat disconnected. Ok, so I tried to call and was told it would be more than 5 hours on hold. Five hours! Because Best Buy does a terrible job communicating, they leave relevant details out when you are making a decision, as you can see from the other reviews. They just want you to place the order but don't really care about fulfilling it and by the way, that's also how you miss out on other deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday! That's their true goal.",0,1

Later in the week, I checked the order status and found that they had cancelled my order. Once I finally got through to customer service, they explained it was cancelled due to unavailability. I checked their website and it showed availability, but Best Buy refused to honor the price from Monday. Spoke with a manager William P. and he refused as well.

Best Buy,Unnecessary rigidity and Inconsiderate policies,"I got a ""Fitbit Lite"" as part of my birthday gifts from my wife in October. I used the watch 3 days before we went on vacation. The watch was very useful but limiting. Also, there are some features and apps I use and need that are not compatible with it. Upon return from vacation, I went to the BestBuy store at Woodmore Towne Centre, Lanham, MD 20706 to return the watch and upgrade to the ""Fitbit Versa 2 Special edition"" so that I can be able maximize and enjoy the use rich features of Fitbit in the Versa 2 Special edition, but unfortunately, one of the store associate referenced the 14 days return policy has passed so she cannot help me. My efforts to make her understand the situation why I wasn't able to return it with the 14 days return policy (on vacation out of the country), but she insisted on what their policy holds. I left the store unsatisfied and unhappy and stocked with using a particular watch that doesn't meet up my daily needs from a fitness and lifestyle watch. Unfortunately, it would have been better to have any of the cheap fitness watches that does same thing as the Fitbit Lite. So, because of Bestbuy return policy I cannot upgrade unless I buy a new Fitbit watch. This is inhumane and inconsiderate, and unnecessary rigidness. Learnt from this, next time I will know where to source my electronic needs and gears.",0,1
Best Buy,"Shipped damaged item, refused to let me speak to a supervisor","I purchased 2 robots as Christmas gifts for brothers. They arrived in separate boxes, with both boxes undamaged. Each robot was wrapped in shrink wrap inside the box. After removing the shrink wrap, the packaging of one robot had been broken into and some accessories taken out. It was obvious that it had been shipped out that way. Best Buy is now out of stock, so I cannot exchange. I contacted customer service and they offered me a 10% discount ($4.00), but I could not return the damaged item if I took the discount. I explained that I wanted to try and find the robot elsewhere and asked 8 times to speak to a supervisor. I was not allowed to do so. I will not be shopping at Best Buy online again.",0,1

Best Buy,The whole experience was worst,"The whole experience was worst. I ordered an item on November 30 and it was supposed to be delivered on Dec 4 . For some reason it got one day delayed . I understand this type of situation. But, it did not arrive on Dec 5. Rather they didnot send me any email regarding the situation. Two days passed by and I decided to get with the customer support. The waiting line was upto 30-45 min. however I decided to give one more chance and they said it will arrive on 9th of December since the package was lost in the middle of transaction. Guess what! It was not in the mail again. I was frustrated and I called them to cancel the order but they wouldnot cancel it I dont know for what so reason. I would rather pick up from the store next time.",0,1

Could not cancel online .Called customer service if you can call it that after 1 1/2 hour in phone I waited for call back. Women calls back says it's been delayed that all she knows and because they put it in as shipped It could not be canceled. Ok,fingered I go to store Oxford Valley in Pa. and talk to manager and get it straighten out. Talked to to CSR then manager who were no help got to general manager explained situation he understood and said he agreed I should be able to cancel order.He said I would have to call customer service told him I did and they were no help I asked him to call he tried to call and was hung up on after 25 minutes, called again they were supposed to call him back in 40 minutes and he would call me .He never called me back.So I'm out $250 They don't know when it will be delivered and I can't cancel and no at Bestbuy has a answer.I would not buy anything on line or at this big box store with this level of customer service.Lost a loyal customer for life.Beware bad customer service can't cut through red tape to fix a problem when they acknowledge that are wrong.",0,1

Their ""solution"" wasn't solving anything, they weren't able to explain why they were offering that or how it made sense. Horrible horrible experience. After ~2 hours of my time wasted just waiting to talk to someone, and then the person not being able to answer a single question for 25 minutes, I asked to speak with someone else. They put me on hold for 15 minutes, got back on the line and then said they couldn't get me someone else then hung up... I spent ~$300 and this is the service they are offering? I am never purchasing from Best Buy again.",0,1

I was called to set up installation for Nov 21,2019 with a time between 7:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. Had spoken to delivery team the morning of install to make sure they had proper phone number and asked to confirm time if possible. She had the tech call me and stated he was 135 miles away and would not be here until 4:00. I asked him just get here as quick as possible. He never showed up so called and complained and was offered $25.00 for the missed delivery. Wanted to reschedule for Wed. before Thanksgiving and I explained that would not be acceptable with prep for the next day. I called the local store and spoke to the appliance mgr.who made some phone calls and set up to have it delivered on Saturday, again a 7:00-1:00 window. Received a call around 11:00 stating it could not be delivered today. I then called the manager again at the store and he supposedly got a delivery set for around 4:00. Again a no show so called back to the manager and he stated that a representative would be in contact from the sublet delivery firm, which i did receive around 6:00 p.m. I was told that they had a man coming from out of state that would be at my house between 4:00p.m. and 8:00p.m. I asked since it was already 6:00 where in his travels was he?

Best Buy,Best Buy is not the best buy!!,On black friday I purchased a HP laptop computer. It was a gift for my son. He picked it up on Monday and was told they did not have it.

Absurd that his huge store could not assist in a accommodating manner. So I cancelled the order and purchased on Amazon and received it in 2 days. Best Buy Goodbye!!,0,1

I had another appointment I had to go to do it didn’t occur to me to see if I had receipts and registration information - haven’t arrived via emailI either as requested. I tried immediately to contact customer service -for over two days now and have been disconnected several times, rerouted to the wrong place, put on hold forever… I will cancel my order and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to BEST BUY again.

Best Buy,The most horrible customer service experience ever.,"I ordered a smart TV from the Best Buy website on Nov. 30. It was supposed to be delivered today, Dec. 5, and I received an e-mail from Best Buy on Dec. 4 saying it had been shipped. However, when I checked the tracking information with the carrier, OnTrac, on their website it said that they had not yet received it from Best Buy, which was confirmed when I spoke to OnTrac by phone. So I called Best Buy customer service, waited nearly an hour for a call back, and the woman I spoke to did not communicate clearly. When I politely asked her to let me speak to her manager or another agent, she kept talking, and when I asked again, politely, she hung up on me. I called customer service again and at the same time contacted customer service chat on the website. The phone agent was polite but put me on hold several times and finally told me that he was unable to help me and I should call back again tomorrow. The website agent that I was chatting with at the same time was more helpful, and was able to tell me that the TV was at the warehouse waiting to be picked up by the carrier, but she could not tell me where the warehouse was located. She offered to send me another TV, but told me I wouldn't get it for another 5 days! Unbelievable. I will have to contact the carrier again tomorrow as they are closed for the night before deciding if I want Best Buy to ship me another TV. I will never order anything from Best Buy online again, and God help you if you need customer service for anything.",0,1

Best Buy,Shipment did not make it,"Ordered a tablet on Black Friday on bestbuy.com. The item was half off. I needed it for a corporate event the next Thursday. I paid extra for shipping. Unfortunately, Fedex did not deliver as they stated (normal for them). So, I called the customer service line for Best Buy to try and see if I could pick one up at my local store for the same price and return the one that was delayed. It took 40 minutes for someone to finally respond. The lady that answered could hardly speak English (very hard to understand) and was clueless about what I was asking. After trying to get it through her mind, I finally gave up and asked for a supervisor. She said I would have to wait. I said okay. Then, she hung up on me. A waste of over an hour of my time because of POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. However, there is a happy ending. I was able to reach my local Best Buy Store and the Store Sales Manager (Tera) took care of me and handled it all. My recommendation to everyone out there that has a Best Buy near you - forget using the corporate customer service number. Go to your local Best Buy store and ask to speak to the Store Sales Manager. If they are half as good as the one we have here, they will help you. Thank you Tera!",0,1

Best Buy,I could not be more disappointed with…,"I could not be more disappointed with my recent Best Buy experience. I was gifted a TV and mount for Christmas, as well as Geek Squad Installation. However, Best Buy messed up and didn't mail the mount in time for my Geek Squad appt. Also, they didn't inform me it was an extra $80 to mount a TV over a fireplace (makes no sense, took them 15 minutes start to finish). Anyway, when the Geek Squad arrived and didn't have my mount, they told me they had an extra one in the truck that was compatible with my TV. However this mount was $149.99 instead of the $49.99 one I originally purchased. I did not want to pay the extra money but I had taken the day off of work to be there for the installation, and the Geek Squad agent told me that I could do a price adjustment as soon as it went on sale for Black Friday the following week. Well, after spending all that extra money that day I wasn't expecting, next week I called and talked to 3 different people trying to get a price adjustment and it turns out there are black out days during the week of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The people I talked to basically told me ""too bad, out of our hands."" So I called back today for a price match since I found the same mount for $100 on amazon. After being #99 waiting online to talk to someone, as well as over 2 hours on the phone, being transferred to 5 different people, they finally came to the conlcusion that the mount was sold by a 3rd party and so they can't do a price adjustment nor can I return it. The person who sold me the mount arrived in a Best Buy truck with my TV, had on a Geek Squad shirt, EMAILED ME a receipt that says ""Best Buy and Geek Squad"" on the top, and they are telling me they can't do anything. They also refuse to tell me who the third party is. I am furious and will never be purchasing from Best Buy again on principal. This is FRAUD.",0,1

The delivery guys scratched and damaged our brand new wood floor by sliding the fridge back and forth on the wood. I called that day to file a claim and was assured that they would fix the problem. Over the last 3 months, I’ve spent hours every single week on the phone with their 3rd party company trying to get information. I’ve gone into the store to talk to a manager. I have spent more time emailing and waiting on hold over the phone. I have wasted HOURS of my life trying to get someone out here to fix our floor and have had ZERO response. I am BEYOND DISAPPOINTED in Best Buy. I am constantly just given new phone numbers to call and wait on hold and I am told someone will call me back. Now it’s been 3 months and my floor is damaged and Best Buy has ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY for taking care of their customers. They just tell me their contracted company ‘sucks’ and this is not uncommon.

My girlfriend didn't like the color so I went to the store (Austin Tx South park meadows) to return the item but they said they have to charge me a $45 restocking fee b.c the item is open. I told them I bought it this way b.c it was already an open item. The Store manager said there is nothing he can do (or willing to do) (pretty disinterested in helping) and said it states on the website if cellular items are open and returned there is a fee. I reinforced that the it was sold to me as an open item and I never used it. In addition, the policy he was referring to is for new and unopened. I told him it doesn't say anything about an item that was sold as an open item. I called the bestbuy helpline to assist and they basically said yes you are right but they couldn't make the store manager override the fee. I asked to speak to her manager and have a copy of the phone recording transcript emailed to me, then the bestbuy rep said there is no one else for me to talk to.... but I reinforced that I want to speak to her supervisor then she said she will get her manager and to hold on the phone. I was on hold for over 1 hr and then the bestbuy rep just hung up the phone on me. Worst customer service ever and I will no longer be taking my business to bestbuy!!!",0,1

Best Buy,Little rant about best buy,Little rant about best buy. We went into the store and purchased a gas range and a refrigerator. We paid for all these geek squad warranty horse crap and of course extended warranties and installation. Before the stove arrived on the 26th i double checked everything and learned they are shipping the wrong stove. So i called and canceled because they were unable to just charge me the extra amount of the new stove and send the right one. So we make a second trip into the store and purchase the correct range. Which will be delivered on the 5th. Friday night we take everything out of our refrigerator and put it in a cooler outside. The delivery time for our refrigerator was between 7am and 1pm. At around 130pm i call repeatedly to try and determine the status. I finally get a young lady on the phone who informs me the refrigerator was unable to be located at the warehouse so it never went on the truck for delivery. I politely (shockingly i know) informed her that fortunately for me that particular model is sold by just about any other retailer and to cancel my order. She agrees and has an attitude about it. Just before i hang up my lovely wife grabs the phone and is less polite and says she can also cancel every other thing they charged us for and she would like to speak to her supervisor. She is then put on hold for about 15mins before the phone call is completely disconnected. I looked online and loses actually had the exact appliance in stock and they even confirmed it for me over the phone that they could see it. So i drove an hour got the refrigerator and anything else i needed and i saved a couple hundred dollars. Best Buy there is not 1 single product you carry or service that i can't purchase somewhere else. In the days of online shoppping you think they would step up there customer service. Clearly that is not the case.,0,1

Drove 30 min. in the rain to get there just to be told they didn't have it in stock either. Called the store that sent me and was offered a $4 credit on my card and 50% off a phone case. This business just doesn't seem to care about it's customers. Wasted gas and an hour and a half for nothing.

I looked my receipt when I got home and noticed that I was charged full price. I have now been on hold for over 20 minutes. When I was in the store 7 separate employees asked if I needed help but the obviously don't answer the phone. The message on the recording says to go online to get price matching and the representative online said I have to go back to the store. I'm seriously beyond frustrated with the customer service and now I was hung up on while being on hold. I will start ordering from Amazon.,0,1

Best Buy,Miss Information,Went into store to buy computer for Church. Out of stock and was told that It would be delivered to my location within two days. Gave tracking info in an email. Tracking showed no movement. Called and was told that it would be reshipped (never shipped to start with). This was on a Friday and was told that it would be delivered by Monday. No delivery and checked tracking info and it stated it would not arrive until 4 days after promised delivery. Conclusion: Best Buy will tell you and unrealistic delivery date and will provide with a tracking number before the item ships. i will never purchase anything from these folks again based on the fact that you cannot rely on any information that they provide. Sitting here at 3 pm and still no shipment. If it arrives today it will be 8 DAYS!,0,1

At this time Best Buy feels we have appropriatelyaddressed this issue.Upon review of Mr. Mohammed’s account, he called us back in March, 2019 and cancelled his Total Tech Support planthrough our IVR system. This did not, however, include the anti-virus subscription, and that is what renewed last week for$53.74. Mr. Mohammed was advised of this when speaking with our Billing and Renewal department on Nov. 9, 2019.Given the confusion though, we honored his request to cancel the subscription and issued a full refund for the renewal.While this process is dependent on Mr. Mohammed’s issuing bank, customers can typically expect to receive a refundwithin 10 to 14 business days. If he doesn’t receive the refund as expected though, Mr. Mohammed is welcome to call usat 1-800-BestBuy for further assistance.

Best Buy,Last time,"I bought a new whirlpool refrigerator and stove from best buy ladt month and paid for the delivery and haul away service of my old appliances. I was told they would be delivered on the 18th of the following month. On the 18th best buy texted me and said the delivery would be between 10am and noon. Sure enough at 11:45 am the truck pulled in my driveway and I was feeling pretty good about the whole deal. Two minutes later that feeling was replaced with utter disbelief at what I was seeing unfold in my driveway. These two guys grab my new appliances and drag and kick them to the gate of their truck, they then bring them down the the driveway and start dragging them across the gravel and rocks like they are plowing with my refrigerator. Then they start to rip and tear the packaging off of the appliances like a couple of wild animals throwing trash everywhere. One of them is yanking on the cardboard on the stove so hard I thought he was goin g to tear the back of the stove offand at o e point it actually came off the ground about 6 inches and crashed back down. After all of this they walk i to my house leaving all the doors wide open tracki g in mud and dirt and not even bothering to try to use the matts but whatever. They grab the old appliances and proceed to band them i to my new countertops and everything else the possibly could on the way out and again like its no big deal. By the way there was a lot of extra room on all sides of everything they were moving. The. They proceed to practically throw the new appliances i. The door jump.in their truck and gone. All of this in Less than ten minutes. When i went out to my driveway there was plastic, styrofoam, and cardboard everywhere that they just left. It was in my yard my driveway and in my neighbors yard. After i cleaned it up i went and read the terms of delivery and it states very plainly that they are to take all of the packaging material with them. But they only cared about how fast they could get out of there. Very un professional and rude behavior a around.

Best Buy,The never ending return...,"For companies that boast an online presence and have the ability to buy online and pickup in store - best buy is one of them. But let me tell you, there is hardly any integration between the ERP, inventory management, etc. systems in the background. It is far from it. Let me share my experience with you.November 15th 2019 - Purchased a Samsung TV from Bestbuy.comNovember 16th 2019 - Picked up TV from store at Bunker Hill in Houston TX - It was not the experience I was hoping for, they could not find the TV and took them 30 minutes to bring my order up.November 22nd 2019 - realize tv is defective and needs to e returned. November 23rd 2019 - Take TV to the store for return and hence the fun starts.- Stood in line for 15 minutes and was told someone will be outside to bring the tv in- Stood another 15 minutes by my truck for someone to come and bring the tv in to the store- got back in the store where we stood another 30 minutes for our turn to return the tv- the person behind the desk took another 15 minutes making sure the tv was in working condition. Apparently they did not have a box knife or scissors to cut the tape!- Then they processed the refund for $235... Problem is I paid $585 for the TV- Since the TV was purchased online, they have no control over refunds, so they get on the phone with customer service black hole- Customer service has given us an escalated ticket number but no resolution so far...- So we came out of the store without a tv and $350 in refund less and over 2 hours of our life we will never get back.Never will we buy anything from Best Buy... This has never happened to us that we bought something, and had the receipt but did not get the full refund.UPDATE - December 20 2019 - STILL NO RESOLUTION",0,1

I find it funny sometimes if I ask a question, and then someone says 'oh, let me google that for you!'

They claim anything purchased from them after Nov-1st is suppose to provide the buyer, gift receiver or not, up to January 14th to return it. If some dweeb at Best Buy says otherwise, then DEMAND to talk with their General Manager. Be loud about it if you have to. You don't need anyone thinking to themselves that you're a nut case. So remain rational and civil while being loud, and you will draw the attention of customers in the store. You want them on your side, so stay reasonable. Threats don't work. You'll more likely get the audience and the results any rational person would want when you layout your case to the GM.PS: BUT you MUST WALK INTO THEIR STORE. Be civil and quietly request their general manager. Their phone-tree is crap-shoot which in effect shows they don't give a fig for customers so they shunt you around a useless STUPID phone tree. INSTEAD, Go in and talk with the man. If you still don't get reasonable results, report that GM's name and publish it here with what they said. I think everyone here would like knowing.",0,1

I’m a college student and $300 is a lot to lose in 30 minutes. That quick they said it’s nothing they could do. So there was $300 gone in 30 minutes. So no I wouldn’t go back.,0,1

They would not return it OR give me in store credit because of a 15 day return policy they do not review with you when you purchase an item. I will NEVER buy from Best Buy again. I hope they close their doors. Horrible customer service.,0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy service is terrible,"Best Buy service is terrible! Purchase from another retailer. I have purchased many major purchases from Best Buy over the years, including our recent washer purchase and a refrigerator earlier this year. Unfortunately, their customer service has significantly declined, and they now use a third party to perform their appliance deliveries, and the delivery experience is a NIGHTMARE. After experiencing the delivery nightmare, I called the Best Buy appliance department Manager, but he has not responded to my calls or to my emails, which show that Best Buy really doesn't care about you as a customer. We had to wait for more than 8 hours for our washer to be delivered. The delivery service arrived more than 3 hours outside the delivery window we were provided. When I called the Best Buy call center to get an update, I was met by a very unprofessional, unhelpful rep. When the delivery finally arrived, the driver stated that his helper didn't show up for work, and the one guy that was with him in the truck had a hurt foot and couldn't lift heavy things. I was shocked by that comment, and asked him how he was going to remove a washer and install the washer by himself. I didn't want my home destroyed and the new washer destroyed, so I helped him with the installation. It's ridiculous that I paid a fee for a haul away service, installation... in total more than $1,200, and I'm having to be the manual laborer to move and install the appliance. During the installation, it was clear that the installer had no clue about how to install a washer. I asked him about properly leveling the washer and ensuring that the feet were locked into position, and he said it was fine, right out of the box. Once I ran the first load of wash, I saw that he was incompetent, the washer was not installed properly, and the washer shook violently while it was running. The new washer from Best Buy ran WORSE than the 10 year old washer we were replacing! We didn't spend $1,200 to have such a terrible experience and a washer that doesn't work properly. I also called the Best Buy call center, but the rep said that there was nothing she could do in the system until next week, since it was a recent delivery. She said she was see if there was any body they could send out, and would call me back. Unfortunately, she never called me, and I'm still in limbo with a new washer that does not work properly. Is this what Best Buy claims as ""supporting their customer and standing behind the purchase?!"" This Best Buy experience has been a disaster. Purchase your appliances from another retailer that cares about the customer's experience and stands behind the purchase.",0,1

I called the Best Buy and talked with an agent at 5.30p Monday and have been told they are delaying the dispatcher will be at my home in 30 minutes. I called again at 7.30 and another agent told me they cannot be at my home because there is not a dispatcher actually (first Best Buy agent told me lie)! They rescheduled it today (Wednesday). The dispatcher left my home with taken the washer and dryer because both of them have big damages. Pedestals were also broken. Now I do have an angry wife in home with a lot of dirty clothes (I am married have 2 kids). I also having a company in 2 days and no one tell me anything when is going to be the next schedule/installation with brand new products I already paid in full.

Best Buy,I bought a refrigerator online that was not delivered.,"I bought a refrigerator online, a Samsung double door with ice maker. since my current one doesn't have an ice maker I decided to chat online and inquire if the advanced installation will take care of the water line and a water valve since I don't have one; the person online stated that this service will take care of everything. To my relieved I purchased the fridge and the advance installation. Next morning, I decided to double check and I called best buy Gee Squad, this time the person on the phone said that I needed a plumber to run a water line and the Gee Squad would only install the water valve and connect it to the refrigerator, so I decided to cancel this service and just get the regular delivery. On delivery day the delivery window was from noon to 4pm, around 5 pm I called since I didn't get any updates . The person on the phone said that we are in Miami and I should have expected delays because of traffic. I demanded for him to find out what time was I getting the delivery, minutes later he told me that the fridge was in the warehouse because I cancelled the advanced installation, so the system automatically cancelled my delivery. To my outraged I demanded to speak with a supervisor whose named was ""Cristina"", while I was trying to explain to her the whole situation from the beginning she cut me off couple of times and kept saying ""Ma'am there is nothing I can do"". I couldn't understand the lack of understanding and urgency. I told her that installation has nothing to do with delivery and this was a mistake from their part so I wanted my fridge ASAP. She said that the system was showing that the delivery was in transit and I would have to wait 24 hours to call again and schedule a new delivery. I told her that I was a school teacher and I requested half day off so that I could wait for the delivery, she remarked sorry Ma'am but we do not compensate for your time off. At that point I knew it was pointless to continue with the conversation but I wanted to write a review about her so I asked her for her last name or employee ID, and she said that they were not allowed to give it to customers. She said my name is plain Cristina. I admit it I completely lost my cool and I cursed at her while hanging up. Next day, I called to cancel the order and there was no question or attempt to make things up. I'm been buying all my appliances at Best Buy for years and I can assure you that this is the last time I even consider this store.",0,1

Best Buy,I need to get this go viral.,"I need to get this go viral.BEST BUY HAS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TREAT CUSTOMERS WITH NO RESPECT. I needed service done with my 5 month old washer since it's not working right. I called Best Buy in Canton Ohio Geek Squad to make an appointment. This employee yelled at me for not checking to make sure its balance, but I was trying to explain that it was and only having 2 sheets in there shouldn't come off balance. Then it didn't matter bc it did it several times when my boyfriend was down there and took 3 hours to wash one load because it wouldn't spin to get all the water out. He yelled at me that I might not balancing it right and I dont need anyone to come out. Finally I said, just make my appointment. It was 10 mins of him trying not to make the appointment so he was trying to avoid making the appointment. He did but I figured I'll call the store today and talk to the manager of how I was treated by the employee. I talked to the assistant manager and was treated the same way. Then he asked me who I've talked to and I wasn't sure. I know it was a man but didn't get his name. It shouldn't be hard to see who worked last night in the Geek Squad. Then when I said I think he was a black man, he jumped down my throat saying like I was accusing that he was black. Hell no!! Geez he asked me who I talked to and I didn't say it at first because I thought it shouldn't be hard to see who worked that department last night just check the schedule and be done. Sometimes you can distinguish what race your speaking with. I dont need to be accused of something I'm not. He wanted me to tell him of I spoke with. That shouldn't be hard to check who worked and made the appointment, but he wanted more so I just said I think it was a black man..so is that so wrong. Or would it been different if I thought the man was Asian or maybe a heavy accent like Spanish or even German??? Would that make a difference. Or even he still had an English accent does that matter??? No it wouldn't be looked at that way, I said maybe a.back man it changes it. Really?? I'm not racist this is ridiculous that you can't say Anything or its offended. Then I called corporate to tell them how I got treated from both and didn't even get to the point about the man I talked to. This lady hung up on me. DON'T EVER SHOP AT BEST BUY.

Best Buy,Last year I purchased the Tech Support…,"Last year I purchased the Tech Support and 2 back up cameras... I had one installed and one that needs to be installed... I knew my Tech support subscription may be up so after being unable to schedule an install on line, I went to the store. (Best Buy Sterling VA)I spoke to them and told them I needed to buy a car radio to be installed and set up installation of a back up camera.My subscription for tech support was expired so I got a new one, Last year I paid under $200 for support. This time they tell me it's $200 and includes computer software protection which I do Not want. Since I'm getting installation on 2 vehicles I get it anyway. I then tell him I need to schedule the installation... His reply... Oh sorry we don't have a tech at this location...You'll have to CALL another location to get an appointment... I then call 5 different stores. After a 4-8 minute process on your automated system each time, I am told each time there are no appointments available until Dec 23 or January.So I just paid $200 for a subscription that expires in 1 year and I can't use it for 2 months!. Not only is this unacceptable to wait that long but the worse part is I'm only getting 10 months use of a 1 year program and NO ONE told me that when they sold me the subscription. So I begin the 3 hour saga of trying to call customer service to get a HUMAN to discuss this issue with... After no less than 5 phone calls of 10-20 minutes each I am told each time they need to transfer me to a different dept to help me... I told the story over and over each time to be told I would be transferred AGAIN. And each time no ONE asked for my name. I was so frustrated I drove to ANOTHER Best Buy to speak to a Manager in person. I was directed to the on duty shift manager ( Best Buy Leesburg VA around 2pm)I asked to speak to her privately so I could relay the whole story. Her response was that the tech program was for many services so that's why they would not have mentioned the appointment shortage. To which I responded that I made it clear when I got there that was what I needed. My suggestion was that they should not be selling a service they cannot perform for 2 plus months with out full disclosure... Again, no interest... I finally looked at her and said, ""you haven't even asked me my name."" She then offered for me to write it down.Seeing that nothing would be done I asked her how to get my money back for a service I cannot use... I reminded her I had been on the phone for over 3 hours trying to get help... She said I would have to call the number on my receipt to get a refund!!!So AGAIN I call... and go througt more automated systems... And am told.... They should have refunded it in the store because now it will take 14 days to get my credit back on my card.I can promise you I will NEVER buy form you again.. I have never spoken to so many disinterested ""Customer Service"" reps from one company. You have a lot of work and retraining to do and you've lost a customer in the process. And I can assure you that since on one from your company seems to care, I will be sure to post this review EVERYWHERE>",0,1

Another call to Best Buy uncovered a dishwasher was pulled for my order instead. New date, November 5th was scheduled. Lo and behold, phone call from BB to let me know my fridge will not be delivered. So, although they had no trouble charging my credit card, they had LOTS of trouble delivering the product.

Until she found out it was more that 6 months. Then she told me I had to call in as well. After going through the recorded phone tree, I got someone I couldn't understand telling me no refund or reship. It had been too long. I said that if I was complaining about a received product I would totally understand, but their own website says it was never delivered! 7 months was all I kept getting again and again, even from a supervisor. When asked ""so you never shipped the product and now you are keeping my money, is that OK with you?"" He started the standard script and I stopped him and asked again with the emphasis on YOU.

Best Buy,Very Bad Customer Service,"So, I am writing to you today to talk about my experience with Best Buy. I bought the total tech support because I thought that it would be worth the investment, was I wrong. So here is what happened to me today and why I will not be renewing my total support membership. At 11:21 this morning I called the Millbury Ma store to tell them that a Turtle Beach headset that I purchased or my son was less than a year ago was not working, They told me that they could not deal with that item because it was not part of the support policy and I would have to contact Turtle Beach. At 12:09 PM I called the 1-800-433-5778 number to verify if this was true or not and they told me to make a appointment and the store should take care of everything. I tried to relay the information that I was told by the store personel earlier but they assured me that it would be taken care of. So I made a 6:40 PM appointment to bring it to the store. At 3:40 PM I called the number again to verify that I would not be driving to the store and find out that they would not except the item. The woman again assured me that if they could not fix it at the store, that they would send it to the manufacturer for me. At 6:40 PM I arrived at the store and was told that they could not help me with the item and I need to contact the manufacturer. At 7:00 PM, I called the 1-800 number again and explained everything that happened to me and they told me that the store did the right thing. I was extremely irritated because I was told by 2 different representatives that things would be taken care of. I insisted to talk to a supervisor and they told me that there would be a 1 hour wait time. They told me that the supervisor would call me in one hour or so . It is now 9:10 PM and no phone call yet.

They ordered parts for the repair and the parts never arrived. Per their policy I had to wait 30 days to qualify for a replacement tv. 30+ days later I had to call and get the manager to approve the swap. The manager never approved despite telling me he did and I made yet another call. Finally I was able to schedule the swap after spending over 2hrs on the phone. Then I got a generic 800 call advising that they had to reschedule. Yet another call 22 minutes to sort that out. So if you can wait for 45 days then your warranty may be right for you?!?,0,1

All I was told is that I was sent the promotional and did not request an adjustment within 20 days and nothing could be done.

Best Buy,Terrible customer service,"I am writing this to express my frustration with best buy customer service in sales department. I recently bought a Bosch dishwasher from them and after finding the model online I called only to ask if the installation cost would cover cost resulting from my current dishwasher being hardwired and the the one I am buying needing a outlet. I was very explicit and repeated the question 3 times and 3 different forms. Customer rep said I wouldn't incur any cost and the installation will cover everything. I bought the item based on that answer. However when the installer came, he told me I will have to pay extra $130 out of pocket to install this product (to make a outlet for the dishwasher to connect). I had to send the item back. Because of this, I missed a sale on a different dishwasher on home depot and also I had to change my schedule to make time for the installation. At the end, I have wasted my time and money. This is specially upsetting as this was not a complex question and according to the installer I am not the first person who has faced this situation and according to my searches and reading online issues with best buy installation of dishwasher, I found other people who had to deal with this. So clearly, best buy is aware of this and still chose to give wrong information to customer asking specific question and putting them in a position where they have to choose to send the product back (after they spent the time in finding one and making time for delivery) or pay additional fee. I called bestbuy again after the installer had left and the person told me that I have to pay extra to create a outlet near my dishwasher for that dishwasher model and there is nothing bestbuy can do about this. Seems like Best buy doesn't value their word and their customers time.",0,1

I was told it would definitely be delivered by the end of the day on Monday (the 21st) . Approx 2 hours later I received shipping confirmation that it had shipped and would arrive on Tuesday the 22nd. So I was lied to by the best buy website and customer service also. I could have purchased it at 2 other websites for about the same cost but I chose best buy. Next time I will probably shop elsewhere where the do not lie to you. This is not the first time for this issue, but it may be the last.",0,2

Best Buy,Three times is not a charm and four is too much .....,"Three times is not a charm and four is too much .......Four weeks ago we bought a whirlpool refrigerator from Best Buy. After delivery and installation, my husband noticed that the doors and handles were not adjusted or leveled, so we called Best Buy and asked for a technician to come adjust it. The service guy could not correct the problem and said that it was a manufacturing defect and that we should exchange the fridge. The second fridge came with a non functioning humid control button and accordingly also needed to be exchanged. The third fridge came with a big dent in the back and the delivery people did not bring it into the house. Amazingly enough, they said that they noticed the dent earlier, but had to attempt delivery anyway. The fourth fridge came with 5 dents in the back and this time the delivery people themselves took pictures of the fridge and shared them with my husband. By now we were into our fourth week of waiting for the fridge to be delivered. Today, we were contacted and told that the scheduled delivery for yet another fridge was cancelled because we were refusing delivery. We were blamed for everything and were really surprised that no one mentioned the defects. We were also told that the bumps in the back were standard to all these whirlpool fridges. We were given the option to keep the defective fridge we have now with the non functioning humid control or return the unit. No brainer we are returning the unit. Too bad we wasted a whole month on them. Definitely the worst customer service. Nobody knows what they are doing and nobody cares. NO MORE BEST BUY!",0,1

Best Buy,If I can give NO stars I will,"If I can give NO stars I will. Went in store looking for a laptop the one I wanted wasn’t in-stock but was available from another store. That was October 11. They ordered the laptop from that store to have it delivered to my home. At check out it said I will receive the laptop the next day, October 12th which would have been on Saturday, about 1:45 that morning I received a text and email that it was delayed and that if they didn’t ship it by November 10th that they were gonna cancel it. Ok, there’s no way I can wait until November being this was time sensitive and for work purposes and that I had mentioned to the sales guy. I called to cancel I was told that it was in fact ready to be shipped they were just waiting on FedEx to pick it up. As I keep track FedEx has a expecting delivery date for today Monday the 14th at 10:30. I realize they haven’t picked up the package so I give FedEx a call. All they say they have is a shipping label and no information on pick up or delivery! So I’m definitely upset. Try calling the store ( in the am like 9:30) it’s supposed to be shipped from and no answer! Try calling the store who ordered it no answer! Finally get a number off they’re website and speak to a customer rep. After all the explaining what I was going thru and him putting me on hold for 4min he say FedEx didn’t update they’re systems and say he see a delivery for 12pm today (smh) go on to say if it’s not delivered today to definitely give him a call back (joe) so I go back to my FedEx app and it all of the sudden says delivery for today by 12am! There’s no delivery out until 12am! So now I know I’m being jerked around. Call FedEx again and again nothing on they’re end for pickup. Finally speak to someone from the actual store it supposed to be shipped from and I’m told it’s just sitting there waiting on FedEx to pick up! Again! I call FedEx and again no pickup info! So now I definitely want to cancel and I’m told I cannot cancel a order that hasn’t been shipped and from the looks of no attempts of it being shipped! I’m told I have to receive it then return it! I ask, how can I return something that’s not being shipped to me!? Nothing! No explanation only that they cannot cancel the order! They are the worst! Would keep ur money and just have the item sitting there! No one tried to find out why it was sitting there! Didn’t investigate the problem with FedEx or whoever suppose to do the shipping! They just make bogus FedEx labels and shipping times with no intentions on shipping your order! I don’t think they actually have it in stock just keep lying to keep your money! However I’m glad I didn’t pay cash! I will not accept it and will not pay to ship it back! Best Buy takes your money and lie to you about having it in stock! They will never get my business or no one else’s if I can help it! I will tell everyone I know and my social about my experience! All they have to do is cancel the shipping with FedEx!

Best Buy,"Good Products, Horrible Customer Service!!","I love this washer/dryer I bought, the reason I am giving it one star is because of Best Buy. I paid the extra money to have it ""Expertly"" installed and was happy at first. After a few days I noticed my clothes were beginning to feel tighter and fade a little. After a while of just thinking I was getting fat I decided to investigate the washer and dryer to see if that could be the cause. Once I figured out how to have it opened when the washing cycle starts I figured out the ""experts"" that came to install it mixed up the hot and cold water connections. It took me a while to come to this conclusion because after they installed it I was told by the ""experts"" that they tested it and everything was working perfectly. If they had actually tested it I would think they would of noticed the hot water coming out of the machine when it is on the cold setting.After figuring out what it was I contacted the best buy customer service to get some one back out here to fix it. They told me that since it has been past the 90 days and I didn't get the extended service plan that they can't do anything to help. My family has lost hundreds of dollars because we had to buy new clothes and I spent a couple hundred more having the ""Experts"" install it.

Besides the fact that I spent a lot of time to get to speak to someone in the Rockaway store (NJ), I was surprised to find out that I cannot even return my product for a credit store since I opened the box. How can one look at the product without opening the box and eventually make a decision if the product is what they expected to see when they made the decision to buy it? In addition to that, when I went to the store, full of hope that I will find what I was looking for, they did not have almost anything in terms of Samsung S10+ cases.I strongly recommend that they review their return policy in order to make decisions based on individual cases and to not have ""a one size fits all"" return policy.

Best Buy,It appears that I am just the latest…,"It appears that I am just the latest victim of bad customer service as it relates to appliance delivery. The initial process of purchasing the appliance was top notch. A Best Buy employee came to my house measured the opening for the cook top and the purchase was completed on the spot. Then the nightmare started. One day prior to my original scheduled delivery I received a phone call and was informed that the cook-top had not arrived and that the delivery would need to be postponed three days. No issue there, I was actually appreciative of the phone call. The morning of the 2nd delivery date the installer calls me and ask if I have the cook-top is in my house. I informed them that it wasn't and that they were suppose to deliver and install the cook-top. The delivery driver apologized and said that I need to call Best Buy to fix the order. I called Best Buy immediately after I hung-up with the delivery driver and waited over an hour and half for someone to answer the phone...they never did answer the phone. After about 40 minutes on hold I decided to try their chat feature and was able to reach someone almost immediately. I left my phone on hold as I was curious whether they would ever answer the phone, they never did.The individual from the chat rescheduled my order but before I ended the chat I wrote the following (excerpt from the chat):Visitor (18:41:34 GMT) : that is fine. So to confirm:Visitor (18:42:31 GMT) : When they come on Thursday they will come with the stove top, install and haul away the old stove topKarl N (18:42:54 GMT) : That is correct. all 3 services are schedules on October 3, XXX. Visitor (18:43:29 GMT) : ok, just saw the texts and emails. to confirm delivery and installVisitor (18:43:36 GMT) : thanks for your helpKarl N (18:43:42 GMT) : You're most welcome.So now I am thinking there is no way they get this wrong I have it in writing that they will show up with the stove top this time....I was wrong. Thursday morning the delivery people show up at my door and they first they ask is: Where is the cook top? At this point I am about the loose it, so with obvious disappointment I said that they were suppose to BRING the cook and INSTALL it. The installer apologized and as he turned to leave said that this is typical of Best Buy. At this point I drive to store, since I know that Best Buy doesn't answer their phones and their chat representatives have proven to be useless. I explain what happened to the sales representative at the appliance section and he reschedules the delivery for the 4th time. The day of the appointment comes and no one arrives or calls to cancel, they just didn't show-up. So I go back to the store talk with the same sales representative and they reschedule the delivery for the 5TH TIME.....Now I am sitting here waiting with 1 hours left in there service window after the 5th reschedule and I have come to the realization that I will never see the cook top I ordered from Best Buy.

It is now Friday and I never heard from anyone and am currently on hold trying to find a day for them to come back. We are going on 22 minutes if me in hold while the lady tries to get ahold of the installing company. DONT use Best Buy!!!!!!,0,1
Best Buy,Don't buy gifts at Best Buy,Think twice before you buy a Christmas gift at Best Buy store. Be sure the person getting the gift wants it. After 15 Days Best Buy will NOT give a cash refund.

Best Buy,I am so disappointed that I cancelled my purchase from Warner Stellian in order to save a little money from Best Buy,"I am so disappointed that it's not possible to give a zero-star rating. I have made numerous purchases online but never experienced the issues that I've had with Best Buy. To begin with when I attempted to purchase the double oven my purchase wasn't going through and I received a call from the Visa fraud department that the issue was that they are putting a hold on transactions processed through Best Buy online website due to issues with fraud. Visa had to help me process this transaction in order to avoid fraud. I received an email from Best Buy indicating that the purchase of my among was a success . However six days later I received an email from Best Buy saying action was required in 24 hours as they were unable to process my order. I reached out to my credit card company, Visa, and we're told that that day Best Buy attempted to reprocess my order 4 different times and in various amounts. I was told by Visa that I had to reach out to Best Buy and help with processing the transaction again. However calling the Best Buy quote on quote customer service line there's no real option that points you to anyone who is able to help you process a transaction. I spent several hours on hold waiting for various people from Best Buy to try and help me finally going to the website and attempting an online chat. The person on the chat line directed my computer to, she called it, a secure location where I would fill out a form and there would be experts available to help me. I would have to pay $5 per question. However she told me not to worry because this could be refunded. I had no time to respond and was automatically redirected to a different website. I hung up and attempted again to call the customer service line and in the meantime received an email from Best Buy asking me to rate the services they had provided so far. In that survey I indicated the issues that I was having and did finally get a response from from Best Buy to help process the order. Part of the reason for the purchase of this double oven was that Best Buy was offering free installation. The scope of work agreement for the installation of a double of a double wall oven indicated that you needed to provide a power cord. I had no idea what kind of power cord would be required. I called the Best Buy customer service line was on hold for several hours before I got through to get a person who spent 40 minutes trying to figure out what kind of power cord I needed. She took a wild guess and ordered a four prong power cord for me which she then appended to my order. On the date of the installation there were several issues with the power cord being delivered in time for the installers since they didn't bring the power cord with them. However the installers got there and indicated I would not need a power cord. They removed the double oven and told me that I needed to get an electrician to first install a junction box and then to call the Best Buy customer service number to reschedule the completion of the installation. They took with them my old oven. That day I attempted to return the power cord since it wasn't needed but the Best Buy main store in Richfield Minnesota indicated that the person who delivered the power cord hadn't updated the delivery yet in the system so they had no record that I had the power cord delivered even though it was in my hand. That same day I had the junction box installed and called the Best Buy customer service phone number back again in order to reschedule the completion of the installation. I was told by the representative on the phone again after over an hour wait that the completed installation would be done that Friday, September 27th. That same day I actually got a call from a human being from Best Buy who indicated that they would be there that same Friday to pick up my oven. I explained to the person from Best Buy that they had already picked up the oven and provided the name of the third party vendor who earlier in the day had picked up the oven. I also received an email from Best Buy indicating that the installation that I thought I had set up for Friday September 27th was actually not set up until October 11th. Since at this point I had no oven I called the customer service helpline at Best Buy to see if I could get an earlier installation date and to inquire as to why when the representative told me that the installation would be completed on September 27th it was now scheduled for October 11th. The Best Buy representative indicated there was no earlier installation date available. It is now September 25th today I received an automated phone call from Best Buy telling me that they're coming to pick up my stove tomorrow even though I have told him twice they've already picked it up and I also received an email indicating that my October 11th rescheduled installation date has to be changed as well because that date is no longer available. The final email I received today from Best Buy was to complete a survey to let them know how much I'm enjoying my new double oven since according to their records everything is complete. If you know someone you really don't like order them a double oven from Best Buy.",0,1
Best Buy,Had the worst Best Buy experience of my…,"Had the worst Best Buy experience of my life. I’ve literally NEVER had an experience worse than this with ANY other company/business (and I’ve had a few bad ones). Where do I start?So, I ordered a tv on 9/24/2019 that was scheduled to arrive by 10/1. Two days later, I checked back to see an update on my order and it said “shipping delayed - order should be shipped no later than 10/25”. Now, this is completely unacceptable for me, as I’m moving in a few days and needed it before 10/3. I then called Best Buy customer service to see what was going on and they told me that “the item was not in stock, so they’re now waiting on a shipment”. Well, my next question is “WHY WOULD YOU HAVE SOMETHING ONLINE FOR PURCHASE IF IT’S NOT AVAILABLE”. I then told them to just cancel it. From that point, what I thought was bad got even worse. They said I couldn’t cancel it because of the status it was in and I’d have to wait until my item shipped then send it back thennnn I’d get my money back. Smh all the while I’d been put on hold constantly for a minimum of 20 min each time. I was on the phone with customer service for HOURS then eventually they put me on hold and NEVER came back. I am literally disgusted and beyond angered. I will NEVER shop at Best Buy again, I don’t care how much an item is. I’d rather pay more for it at a different store than give them a penny of my money again and run the risk of this happening again!UPDATE: 10/1/2019 - When you think it couldnt be worse, come to find out I've been charged twice! Now I have to not only wait a whole month to get my money back for one charge but now I have two!!! And of course, ""customer service"" cant do anything about that either. I will never shop here again, and I will ensure that I tell EVERYONE I know to do the same.",0,1

They said I would need to purchase for about $200 a plan for them to further help me. I am turning them in to Oregon Attorney General office and encourage others to do so also. I can't even log in now. When a business representative says one thing then you act accordingly on that, they should not be allowed to go back on that.",0,1

The price was right.Purchased washer and dryer on Friday with delivery on the following Friday with opening on their website for that scheduled delivery time and date. Immediately after commiting to buy the date and time was changed by them. Picked Saturday 7 am to 1 pm selected and was available. Saturday morning call from them moved delivery 3, then to another call moved to 5, then another call moved to 7, then nothing. Tried several times to contact customer service - nothing. Driver called at 8:30 wondering if they could deliver. Sure Showed up at 9. Asked me to check the W&D on the truck. Odd! Both were severely damaged and they knew it. Looks like the forklift driver with squeeze clamps compressed the sides in about 3 inches on both of them. Would not have mattered anyway because they did not have the mandatory purchased insulation kits on the truck. Driver called BB customer service, they called me trying explain now the delivery would be weeks away but I would have to call the next week to reschedule because that particular customer service rep was off on Sunday. Apparently it can't be handled by anyone else. Nothing they could do.I cancelled the order and won't be giving Best Buy another chance, ever.",0,1

Best Buy,Return Policy Needs Adjustment - But Shopping Experience is OK,"I wanted to order a gift online for a friend and have it for that person's birthday the following week. Since BB return policy is only 15 days, even for gifts, this would hardly even allow a week for a return. I could typically purchase the same item on Amazon with a 30 day return policy. I ended up buying from Best Buy though because the ear buds I wanted had just come out -- BB had them in stock for immediate shipment and they were back order elsewhere. They arrived within 2 days.If you have product questions or return policy questions, you are much better off using online chat than the phone support. Their call in phone center is out of the country and they were not well informed from my dealings with them and they wasted a lot of my time. The online customer support seems to be in US and they were much better informed all around and had ready answers to my questions. Their information gave me the confidence to buy the product from Best Buy, but their return policy, in my mind, is still way too limited.",0,3

Best Buy,WORST BUY,"I had one of the worst experiences ever buying appliances from Best Buy.I bought 2 refrigerators, a washer, a dryer, a stove and a dishwasher from the store in Hollywood.One refrigerator was delivered and installed as per the agreement.The stove was also delivered and installed as per the agreement.The other refrigerator, washer/dryer and dishwasher, however, turned out to be a seriousproblem, costing me a great deal of money.I set up a delivery time on August 28th and no one ever showed up. I called a few minutes before the end time of the delivery window and was told they couldn’t do anything until the time had expired. After the time went by and they still hadn’t come, I called and they said they weren’t able to deliver it that day even though I had hired an employee to stay there for the 4 hour window they said they would deliver in. I rescheduled. Hired another employee to stay at the delivery address for 4 hours - no one showed up.I resceduled a third time - same thing. When I called back to cancel all the appliances, I was promised delivery at 7:00 AM the next morning.I stupidly believed them and agreed. I had an employee there waiting. They came at 9:30. It was clearly not a Geek Squad or Best buy delivery, just two guys and a pickup truck. They said they could not install the appliances because they didn’t know how. The house where these appliances were being delivered is a rental property I own.If the appliances would have been delivered on the initial date that I was promised, August 28th, the new renters could havemoved in the next day. Because they were not delivered that day or the next or the next, it cost me one months rent.In addition I paid 3 employees 4 hours ea. and 1 employee for 2 1/2 hrs to stay there waiting for delivery. ON TOP OF THAT, I had to pay a plumber to install everything, which was a total of $400!My receipt says delivery and installation of the appliances were included in my purchase price. I have complained to corporate and have not heard back as yet. I will NEVER SHOP THERE AGAIN and will make sure everyone I speak to knows how bad their service is!",0,1
Best Buy,I am in the midst of the worst customer…,"I am in the midst of the worst customer support situation in my 66 years! We bought a dishwasher last week, with an installation date of yesterday, September 13; between the hours of 12N and 4PM. As of this writing, I have yet to know why it came and past with zero notification from you, Best Buy. Sure we’ve called, but your “we’re experiencing a high volume of calls and currently the wait time exceeds 3 hours” is a bit much. Sometimes, we get lucky and are able to request a call back. Sometimes you actually get a call back and actually talk to someone. Unfortunately that someone could not help, last night at 7pm, when clearly there wasn’t going to be an installation. But, your appointment system still listed it so she could not change it. She advised we should check today and reschedule. So we tried that and guess what? Your appointment system doesn’t even show it any more. It says I did something wrong and we should try our order number, which we did and guess what, something went wrong and we should call. So we did. That was 3 hours ago, when the anticipated wait time was 34 minutes, we still are waiting. If I could as easily take my payment back as quickly as you took our money, I would. But it looks like you have our money now and it is up to the consumer to try and get the product.Update 1: finally gave up and called our closest store. It appears the process is that 1) a schedule for product delivery and 2) a schedule for installation. 2 was scheduled for yesterday but 1 was never set. So an installation with no product ends up being cancelled. Sounds like a very archaic process to just schedule installation. So product is now scheduled for September 16 but installation is an issue. An email is being sent by my store to their support so that #1 and #2 can be done at the same time. You know, like it should have been done when originally requested installation. Archaic is the best word I can describe Best Buy.Update 2: John from our Schaumburg Best Buy has been the most helpful. But he isn’t getting anywhere with the online folks that are doing things and not updating any information that he can see. John is at a loss. He has sent further emails and has left messages. We’re at a wait and see what they end up doing mode right now. Oh, the expected delivery of the product on Monday the 16th has been canceled. Not sure why. They ain’t telling anyone anything. Right now, John or someone from the store will call me by end of day with the latest. John advised we really shouldn’t do anything until we know what if anything they’ve done or not done. Online the order states they are working on it. Oh, they did somehow have time to “update” the taxes charged and update the credit card charge!Update #3: well, trying to beat them at their game! Current hold time is 48 minutes. I have been on hold for 1:19:10 so far! I am retired! I will wait as long as it takes for these “people” to pick me up!Update #4: well that didn’t work, staying on hold. Lasted a whole 2 hours of hold time..and as a retired AT&T employee, that is 1 hour and 46 minutes to effing long. Ever. Ever. Did I say effing ever.! Anyway, live chat! I found that on the web site of yours. It worked. Well nothing happened much other than I actually talked with someone who actually cares about the customer. Her name is MaryGrace S. And she will babysit my order and see what she can do for the rest of her shift. They will email or call with updates! If unable she will have the scourge delivery people call me with answers and objectives to please me and keep my order intact.Update 5: final. Got a call from corporate. Told me to call back so I did. Talked with corporate. They said an error was made when originally set for install on September 13 since the dishwasher was actually on backorder. Earliest time for a new delivery and install is October 1. Well, that just didn’t sit well with me and I told her so. Nothing. So I told her to cancel my order and give my money back. She put me on hold. A few moments came back and said the cancel is done and your money will be returned. Nothing more. Not even a sorry. THE END.",0,1

Best Buy,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,My review of Best Buy has to do with the customer service more so than the product itself. My husband purchased a refrigerator two months ago and was given a delivery time frame of 7 am to 1 pm. The refrigerator came at 4:30 pm which is 3.5 hours after the end of the original time frame. This meant being at home the whole day waiting for the delivery of a refrigerator while all perishable items were out in the heat of the summer. A friend of mine experienced the same issue with the delivery. I would recommend purchasing any appliance from Home Depot or any other store than Best Buy. I wrote a letter to their head office and never received a response. Avoid them at all costs!,0,1

Best Buy,Unethical standard warranty process,"I went to buy a geek squad warranty for my $400 phone. I paid $119. There was no written policy or communication from the Best Buy service employee that each instant of repair would cost $89 in addition to the $119 price of the policy. That is more than 50% the price of the phone and the policy does not cover losses or theft. That’s not only robbery but downright unethical not to inform people when they are buying a policy.//. When I got home I noticed this additional cost on the warranty receipt, which is on a small piece of paper, easily lost. On that receipt it gives a phone number for policy cancellations. I called that number and was told there was a fourteen minute callback. After waiting over an hour, it appears they will not call back and I will have to go back to the store to get a cancellation and refund. Conclusion: as a matter of course Best Buy is using as a matter of course unethical business practices to vastly increase their profits. I will not use Best Buy in the future as I have concluded the company is fundamentally unethical.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy and BestBuy.com,"Best Buy and BestBuy.com. If you live in the Greater Austin area DO NOT shop BestBuy.com for fulfillment at the Pflugerville (Stone Hill) store.On BestBuy.com I purchased a new in box refrigerator. However, what was delivered to me was a used appliance. Before I made my purchase I scoured several online sources (Lowes, HomeDepot, Sears, SearOutlet, SearHometown, Goedekers, etc) for the appliance that I wanted. I even checked Craigslist.Delivery was scheduled for 9/11/19, 230p-430p. When the men walk the appliance in the house my first thought is, ""I've seen this refrigerator before. I could not shake the feeling that this is not the appliance I ordered. I didn't think to take a pic until the right side film had been removed (pic attached). However, before that I noticed that the doors were not level. The delivery guy used a level to check my floor, and all sides of the fridge, everything was level, and the door couldn't be adjusted any further. So, this is called in for a return and exchange (I'm thinking no big deal, but this is not a new refrigerator). When it was going to be a return and exchange they could have done this the next day (9/12). However, when I called the prescribed number as required on 9/12 and told them I wanted to return this used item and get a full refund; now it will have to wait until Saturday. My refund--not until 3-5d after the return pickup. This too I find odd, seeing as how they charged my card days before the fraudulent delivery; but they can't refund it before picking up their POS.Anyway, to get proof of this shell game, I returned to my search history and find the pic of the appliance they brought into my home under the disguise of a new in box appliance. The appliance they brought me was the exact one advertised on Craigslist as a new, never used, open box customer return, for $675 (ad and pic attached). Also, notice at the bottom, the white hose/connector; the same on the one delivered to me.On 9/12/19, I went to the Pflugerville store to find out what was going on. Chris, the manager I spoke with kinda addressed my concerns (gave me an 800 number to call); however, he was way too removed from being concerned that somewhere in their chain someone decided that consumer fraud is ok. Someone, somewhere within Best Buy, BestBuy.com and their 3rd Party Delivery company have decided defrauding consumers is a good business model. I know the Attorney General for the State of Texas would love to hear this complaint. I do love Texas’ consumer protection laws. Best Buy and BestBuy.com have defrauded me and I demand satisfaction!Needless to say, Best Buy nor BestBuy.com will ever see another red cent of my money again.

Have checked on line for a ""chat"" screen which I found, but from morning to 7:35 pm no one has been available there. Are they out at the bar with the rest of the crew?I wanted to arrange for the store to slap a new address on my $1299 computer & ship it to me. I'm thinking maybe I should send a carrier pigeon with a note to return the damn thing -- the computer, not the pigeon.Oh great: Your automated phone system transferred me to your survey about the automated phone system. It asked me for the usual 1-5 satisfaction rating then disconnected me in response to my ""1"" reply. That's how both my calls ended.",0,1
Best Buy,Won’t buy anything from Best Buy again,We Ordered a Maytag dryer. They didn’t show up for delivery. No call no show. My husband spent an hour on hold waiting to speak to someone and then I waited an hour. Their automated call system said it would be 15 minutes. Today the wait time was an 1 hour 54 min so I didn’t bother waiting. It was Impossible to get ahold of someone to cancel the order. Horrible customer service. Had to ask local store manager to cancel online order.,0,1

Best Buy,This review was written by my husband,"Worst Buy at Best Buy(This review was written by my husband, as I was too frazzled to even think.)After an hour the sound on the “LG UBK80 Blu-Ray Player” we had purchased went wonky — deteriorating gradually to static and remaining discordant noise for over a minute thereafter.No big deal. Bad products happen.Now for the fun part:Four days later, we were in durham and took the DVD player with us to return, but our brake warning light and then alarm went off. We decided to high-tail it back home, 60 miles north. My wife calls the Best? Buy today to explain why we couldn’t return yesterday, and suggest that we return it in about 17 days, the next time we have doctors’ appointments in Durham.Worst Buy tells her that their policy is firm, written in stone and carried from the mount: 15 Days from the date of purchase, or you eat it!We offered to mail it to them at our expense. No Go. Rules is rules: read the fine print.Now, we must drive 120 miles to get our money back.And no, we’re not going to simply exchange it as originally intended. No way.And they could never compensate us for my wife’s hour and a half of absolute anguish.",0,1

Best Buy,Since you do not offer zero stars I had…,"Since you do not offer zero stars I had to give Best Buy 1 star. I ordered a new refrigerator from Best Buy on August 24, 2019. This was not an upgrade - my 8 year old LG which I also purchased from Best Buy died and the repair tech said a new one would cost the same or less than repair. So, with the help of a very nice sales person at Best Buy, I ordered a new fridge and was told it could be delivered on 8/27. I received a call the day before to confirm delivery and then the morning of with a window of 2:30-4:30. At 5:30 I started phoning about the missing fridge and when I could not get a reply at any number, went to the store. I was told that, according to the notes,the fridge was on back order until October. I was also told that this had been known the day before but I was not notified. I was livid - how could I have been given a delivery day and time when they did not have the product? Why was I not notified? My only recourse, I was told, was to take a stainless steel refrigerator (my other appliances are white). The appliance manager refused to accept any responsibility for what had happened. Needless to say Best Buy will not get any more of my business.",0,1

Best Buy,Just had possibly the worst customer…,"Just had possibly the worst customer service experience I have ever received at Best Buy. I ordered a refrigerator last week to be delivered to my house on Friday. Upon arrival the refrigerator was extremely damaged (it didn’t appear that it was inspected AT ALL prior to delivery) needless to say the refrigerator was not installed and I was promised by a customer service representative that I would have a refrigerator at my house the next day and that someone would be calling me to schedule that appointment as soon as the appliance arrived back at the warehouse. I never received a call to schedule this appointment and the wait to speak to a representative was over an hour. I used the option for a call back and never received a call back. On Saturday after multiple attempts to speak to a representative I finally got in touch with someone who informed me that they will not be delivering the refrigerator and that they are sorry “I misunderstood what the person said to me” that they do not do same day deliveries and would not be able to deliver my refrigerator until Tuesday. I requested to speak to a manager and she said this would take 24-48 hours for review, and I still have yet to hear from one. Now it is Tuesday and my refrigerator arrives, but is unable to be installed because the technicians do not know how to shut off the water line, they were supposed to remove our old refrigerator as well. So they left the new refrigerator and old and nothing is installed. Again, nobody has called to rectify this situation. This is by far the worst customer experience I have ever had.",0,1
Best Buy,Terrible phone etiquette,Called my local Best Buy to inquire about a Microsoft Surface Pro 6. Waited over 5 min with no one coming on line. They lost the sale. Phone etiquette is terrible. I called their corporate number to lodge a complaint and waited over 12 min. REALLY.

Best Buy,Awful Experience - LG Refrigerator & Delivery,"I purchased a LG Refrigerator from Best Buy in August. The same refrigerator was available at other stores but I chose Best Buy for the ability to specifically schedule the delivery and haul-away due to my work schedule. Additionally, my wife and I have two month old twins so we had to plan accordingly for a working fridge. The delivery was set for 8/26/19. Prior to the date, I called to inquire what was required of me to prepare the old fridge for haul away. The old refrigerator was a built-in so I assumed I needed to perform certain steps for haul away. I was informed that it had to be disconnected and taken out of the built-in space. I disconnected the water supply, removed all front panels and moved the refrigerator to the center of the kitchen. When the delivery team arrived, they took one look at the fridge and said they could not take it away due to the size. I was informed me that a four-person team was required. There was no mention of this when I called to find out all the details needed for preparation. The new fridge was not delivered on 8/26/19 and the old fridge remained disconnected in the middle of my kitchen. The earliest Best Buy could get another team out to the house was three days later on Thursday, 8/29/19. My family, including 2 two-month old babies, would use a cooler over the next three days. I confirmed multiple times with Best Buy that it would be a four-person team completing the delivery on 8/29/19. Regardless, a two-person team arrived AGAIN. The paperwork clearly stated that a four-person team was needed for the delivery and haul away. There was no apology and Best Buy pointed fingers at the delivery service. Vice versa, the delivery service said Best Buy did not schedule it correctly. I had no choice but to accept the new fridge that day due to our need of having a working fridge. However, we had to live with the old fridge sitting in the middle of the kitchen until the haul-away could be coordinated for a third time. This is entirely unacceptable. While customer service was accessible over the phone they did little to remedy situation. The haul away was rescheduled for Tuesday, 9/3/19 between 7:00am and 7:41 am. The team arrived at 8:30am. There was no call in advance with an ETA or an explanation for the delay. Subsequently, I was late for work. Again, no apology or accountability from Best Buy or the delivery company. I was informed that Best Buy and I could discuss compensation for the errors and inconvenience after the fridge was delivered and the old one taken away. I called the Customer Service Representative and was offered a $75 Best Buy gift card. This compensation that was not worth the aggravation and inconvenience of taking off work and not having a working fridge for three days. I did not accept this meaningless gift card and I should have ordered from Home Depot or any other reliable retailer that offered the same fridge. I will no longer be a Best Buy customer and will continue to share my extremely unpleasant and unprofessional experience with Best Buy to all friends, family and internet reviews.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy & Samsung TV,"Before I start, I want to note that if I could give Best Buy a negative star I would.I bought a Samsung 58"" TV from them 2 years ago with the Geek warranty. This tv is stationed at my weekend home and is hardly used. This past Friday I went to the home and watched a little tv. The tv stopped and wouldn't come back on. Nothing...not even a light. Great news it was still under warranty with Best Buy!!! So I thought. I tried calling their 800-433-5778 number all weekend but nobody picked up. First thing Monday I called for tech support. They informed me that my warranty expired Saturday and since I didn't put the ticket in then, the warranty was expired. I again informed them that I tried to get someone all weekend. But they told me that they wouldn't honor an extra couple of days.I WILL NEVER BUY A DAMN THING FROM BEST BUY AGAIN!!! I WILL NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AGAIN.I wish Circuit City was still around.

Scheduled delivery for our week of vacation noon to 4. Theyshowed up over 4 hours after scheduled time (8:45 pm). Supposed to be the Geek Squad , obviously sub-contracted as 2 “installers” pulled my 75 in TV (lying flat) in the back of their truck into my house. Nothing on them or their vehicle said Best Buy or Geek Squad. When the “installer” started using vise grips on an allen head screw, I asked them to leave that I would do it myself. My wife and I installed it the next day on our vacation. On top of that try and call support and wait on hold for an hour or two. I guess I am not the only one with service problems. The day before our appointment we stopped in and purchased a mini-fridge, which we could pick it up 3 days later at the store, or they would deliver it at no additional charge in 2 days. We picked delivery. Sixteen days later we don’t have the fridge, damaged in route by their delivery service or a refund. Can’t get a replacement until they get the fridge back that they acknowledged was damaged in route. Call their customer support and expect an unusually high wait time do to their great customer service, I have been given wait times as long as 1 hour and 56 minutes. Maybe if their service was better, their call volume and wait time would be less. Just with the TV, sound system, installation and fridge, this was over $4000 in purchases, and my last with Best Buy.

I told them to cancel the subscription (I went directly through Microsoft instead). 10 days later, I didn't see a credit.

Best Buy,Very Bad Customer Service,"Generally I don't post reviews for poor service but this customer service was so poor that I thought for other people...forewarned is forearmed. The only reason I give the a 1 star rating is because Zero stars is not an option.On July 28th I visited the Best Buy store in my area and purchased a new kitchen suite. I had to wait one month for delivery because the the refridgerator was on back order. The week before my order was to arrive I started getting text messages reminding me Sat. was coming and my appliances would be delivered. The morning of delivery I got the same text messages....today is the day...you delivery will arrive between 8:30 and 10:30(for the dishwasher, microwave and stove) and a second delivery was to arrive between 9 and 11 for the refrigerator. So, the first delivery right at 8:30. Eleven o'clock comes and goes and I get an e-mail, my delivery has been delayed call 1-800-BESTBUY to reschedule. Well, I had sold the old refridgerator, it was gone and I had food in boxes and coolers in various places throughout my house and no fridge. So I call the store, they tell me oops fridge is on backorder until Oct 20th. So what am I supposed to do with this food sitting in my house. Best Buy didn't know and didn't care and had no creative solution. Nor were they willing to compensate me n any way for the food I was going to loose.Told me I could escalate it to their resolution center to which they gave me the number. I call them and sure enough my fridge is on back order until Oct. 20th and nothing they can do---I have to resolve the problem with the local store. So, I called them back, manager was with a customer. That was four hours ago and still waiting for that call. But still no fridge. Had he called me I would have suggested purchasing the floor model at a discounted price. He sells a refrigerator I become a happy customer. But Customer Service is a lost art. No one wants it except the people who don't get it and they might as well forget it.Best Buy has turned out to be the Worst Buy! Even though I had shopped around and thought I was getting a fair price, I would have paid more if it had come with better customer service.

Not much different than the kid with a squeegee catching you at a traffic light. For years, I have done my best to avoid going to best Buy, as I find the atmosphere a turn off and intimidating. There are many ""sales associates"" but few with any communication skills, Its as though they are all trying their best to avoid customer interaction.

After several phone calls and transfers I speak to a Citibank employee that eventually credits me back the $24 and suggest I take my gift card to the store and pay off the card that way instead of waiting for the credit card and bill to come. On my lunch break I go to the local Best Buy store. They pull up my account which still shows the $24 late fee. When i hand her my gift card she says...""oh we can only accept cash or check"". Are you kidding me?",0,1

Best Buy,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! Purchased a new tv and the sales rep at the Mt. Laurel,NJ store talked me into the definitive technogy W studio micro sound bar with subwoofer after i questioned the sonos product. He swore it was a much better product as it has a center but in 5 months it's been replaced 3 times and now #3 is defective.. Last bar sent as a replacemnt won't sync with the subwoofer. After 30 days, you need to deal direct with definitive technology. I threw $800 away on junk. Also, the secondary cube speakers will. It sync to the sound bar so you can't add to the sound system even though i was promised it would. DO NOT SHOP IN THE MAGNOLIA SECTION OF THIS STORE!",0,1
Best Buy,Free antivirus security that comes with laptop/Didn’t receive free student discount/ Cheated out of bestbuy reward points,I gave them one star because the laptop I purchased came with a free antivirus but i didnt know if i wanted to keep or return the laptop so I cancelled the free antivirus that came with it and i ended up keeping the laptop so I called to see if i could get the free 6 month antivirus back and the first man told me i could i just needed to wait until i received my laptop and when i finally received it the lady i was speaking to told me i couldnt and i had to purchase it and when i spoke to a supervisor they had two supervisors one was talking to another customer and idk what the representative told him but he kept thinking i had problems with my laptop and kept asking me do i have problems with it and kept putting me on hold when all i wanted to know was if i could get a free antivirus it was a yes or no question and his background was so loud and noisy i couldn’t understand what he was saying so he got back on the phone with me and redirected me to another person which was dumb to me because i was already in the right department and that lady redirected me back to the department i just got redirected from so after that i just hung up the phone then not only did i have a problem getting free antivirus i just recently found out the laptop i paid $600 for i couldve got it cheaper for 300 with a student discount they didnt even offer me with or give me a code or let me know about it i couldve got a backlit laptop if i wouldve knew that or a gaming one then the $5 certificate they gave me from purchasing the laptop i cant even use it because they want you to spend more money they wont let you use it on cheap items you have to use it with items over the $5 amount then it expires in november and i will not be buying anything from them they are too overpriced and nothing is in stock and their items are not worth buying the same laptop i have walmart has it for a cheaper price with a better warranty more storage space and a backlit keyboard with a better processor and all they gave me was 250 points on my bestbuy rewards even though i spent close to 700 dollars they should’ve gave me the same amount of points that i spent 250 is cheap and only worth $5 which is nothing at best buy because everything is over $10 and thats if you get free shipping they cheated me out of points and a good discount deal and its a shame they scam customers out of money by forcing you to spend more money just to get $5 here and $10 there when its nothing compared to the money you put in their pockets they really thought i was going to spend $1000 more dollars to get $10 back then they had the nerve to have a $1000 off sale on tvs thats retailed at $5000 or more thats not even a sale because u still spending over $4000 for them lg’s are not cheap before yall buy laptops dnt make the mistake i made look around first and get the best deal they all the same just different names then they labeled my laptop as a gaming laptop and its not even a gaming laptop just a regular notebook and walmart had it cheaper and listed as a notebook which was not what i wanted at all and walmart one is way better so before yall buy electronics look around or go inside the store first and alot of times their good products dont be inside of stores and a lady in my classroom had a purple hp which is gorgeous and a 17.3 inch from walmart and i think hers was cheaper than mines and looked better and then my laptop scratches up quick and the rubber that is on the bottom of it that helps the computer stand is coming off and i cant believe i spent almost 700 on it and the warranty ends in 2020 which isnt even a warranty it shouldve been two years like dell and other companies i bet walmart have cheaper warranty plans unlike best buy where u have to pay 100 and dont get a discount on it and the 100 one isnt even for a long period of time then once you leave a rating on their website you cant go back and edit it i rated my product 5 stars before i started having complaints and now i cant even edit it to let other ppl know and best buy employees lie alot they told me this pc is good for gaming and its not it can only handle small games with no expansion packs so i only use it for music and homework and its a shame they charge so much for it and its not worth that much money because its not a gaming pc best buy gets over and finesses their customers,0,1

Had I not contacted Apple and spoke to a supervisor about the situation (Tianna), Isaiah would've been able to complete his fraudulent transaction with no problem. Instead the store manager had to return my $363.00, cancel the transaction, place a request from Apple to return my phone, and when the store get it back, put in a non faulty battery in my iphone, something that I previously paid for!

Best Buy,Broke my phone.,"Scheduled an appointment to have a battery replaced in my phone. Not sure why they have appointments scheduled since you have to wait in line. Needless to say, thirty minutes after my appointment it was my turn. Diagnostics ran on my phone and everything appeared to be fine. Took my money and the phone went to the back to be repaired. I was told the repair would take ""a couple of hours. It should be done around 6 PM. We will notify you when it's done."" I left the store just before 4 PM. I received a few updates through out the afternoon telling me they were working on the phone and then silence from 6 pm on. At 8:45 PM, fifteen minutes before closing, I returned to the store to inquire about my phone. Apparently, they had been wondering where I was so they could talk to me. They explained they weren't able to replace the battery in my phone because a wire to the taptic engine was broke. The imbecile had the audacity to accuse me or a previous owner of opening the phone and cutting the wire. I bought the phone two and a half years ago brand new from an AT&T store. The phone has worked flawlessly since. They refused to accept that my phone was fine before I brought it in and insisted it was previous damage. Even had me second guessing my self. They wanted $350 to replace the phone. I requested to have my refund and I would go somewhere else. After getting home and messing with my phone I realized, should be noted I'm not the techy type, there are no vibrations period on my phone. This was most definitely not ""pre-existing damage"" as they insisted. My phone is only kept on vibrate and I know that just minutes before dropping my phone off the vibrations were still working. Wasted an entire afternoon for them to break my phone. I found replacement kits for the battery and now the taptic engine for cheaper than what they were going to charge for just battery replacement. I may not be techy but I can turn a screw driver and I'll just fix it my self.",0,1

Sales Associate: Stephen B.When I asked him if I needed to purchase a monitor, he said NO, and that I could use my MAC computer monitor. When the installer arrived on Monday, August 5, 2019, to install the cameras, he informed me that he would NOT be able to complete the job because I needed a 4K monitor. If I used my MAC computer (1080) I would not be able to see any pictures on the screen. I rushed back to Best Buy and purchased a 4K monitor. After speaking to several representatives via the phone at Best Buy regarding my dilemma, they stated that they would not be able to reschedule my installation until after 8PM because their computers at Best Buy would not allow them carry out this function. So now I have wasted a whole day for nothing to be accomplished. If the sales Associate was familiar with his merchandise, I would not be in this predicament. Obviously he just wanted to make a sale at my expense. Extremely disappointed with this situation. Warning to all customers, do your research on your product BEFORE purchasing the merchandise. I thought that I did, but I guess I wasn't thorough enough. Now I have to take another day off to get these security camera's installed. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Being a widow I had no idea so I called my friendly plumber and had a new shutoff valve put in. Set up another delivery time. Second time men were very nice and helpful. However they only brought the dryer. Not the pedestal or washer and pedestal. They just dropped it off, no install. Third time I set up a delivery appointment, they set up a 3-6 time frame. At 7:30 I called and cancelled the whole order. I never got a call that they weren't coming. I also had to wait for a very long time for a customer service. She was rude and didn't apologize for all those problems. She just said I'll set up your cancellation . Got a nice guy in Missouri, I live in Ohio, who set up the refund. Got email for that . Will get an email and refund for dryer that they picked up today after he gets the word that it was returned. They just don't give a damn if you cancel or never buy from them again.

I asked to speak with the manager (shelby) who informed me he was going to go and buy the tool (but they said the employee brought it from home - they lied they did nothing to the Apple the manager knew nothing about the lies Andrew was spewing out his mouth so he offered to buy it out his pocket whihc is nice, however Best Buy is a large company no employee should have to improvise with their money to meet the customers needs. You cannot have a store of this magnitude with no tools, how can the work get done without tools or you're just collecting monies from the customer with no results knowing good well your company does not have the tools to get the work done. This is unacceptable and I will never have them service anything for me again. I am a member of the Geek Squad services and that's a damn joke. Run from that place save your money and your time , find a organization in which the employees should not have to pay for the supplies to meet the customers demands. That's ludicrous and unacceptable - Still waiting on the tool mind you Amazon was delivering it, the employee had it and the back 2 weeks later has not been removed. The employee even recommended that they may have to wipe my device, really because Best Buy does not have the tools to get the job done properly? Never again you will get my money you fraudulent company",0,1

Best Buy,BEST BUY PROTECTS THE CRIMINAL AND SACRIFICES ITS CUSTOMERS,"Always thought well of Best Buy until yesterday. Been a long-time customer. Yesterday I attempted to use two E-gift cards totally $200 only to find they had already been used. Someone had stolen them. I was asked if I knew anyone in Brooklyn named Alex. Of course not, I'm in upstate NY. They could tell me that much but had excuses for why they didn't have access to further information. The other E-gift card was used and item was to be shipped yesterday. Suppose to put a stop shipment but item went on its way. Won't tell me address of that one either. PROTECT THE CRIMINAL!! Never mind the victim. Best Buy says to file a police report and have it faxed to them. They will tell the police the address. No police unit would do this. YOU SOBs that stole the e-gift cards may your computer blow up in your face. Best Buy! THANKS FOR NOTHING!",0,2

As long as they're contracted with FedEx, I won't order from them, not worth the headache.",0,2

Best Buy,You will be frustrated and angry if you need customer service after you buy a product from Best Buy,"When you purchase a product from Best Buy you better hope you do not have any problems or need service or repair because at that point you will be dealing with their customer service and/or Geek Squad and that's where Best Buy fails. Major fail. You will be put on hold for long periods of time, you will speak with an agent who has little power to actually help you. You will be told that there is no one in your area that can repair your appliance, so they send out a third party company who does not care about providing good service. They get their business from Best Buy, they don't want your business. Best Buy is too big and they do not care about keeping satisfied customers, they just want to sell you things and let you deal with the frustration after the purchase. I seriously will not buy anything from Best Buy because I don't want to have to deal with the lack of customer service after the sale. It's a shame. I purchased a refrigerator in June. I was told it was defective by two repairmen that Best Buy sent out. It is almost two months, and Best Buy has done nothing to get me a new refrigerator. Insignia is the manufacturer and I wrote them a letter. Still nothing, no response, nothing. They hope you will just go away. I'm going to be a thorn in their side.

Best Buy,Expensive,"Expensive, lazy employees, shipping problems, Respectively: I am on a budget, so when I look at buying a computer and see the price tag, I walk away feeling like I've wasted my time. If I am looking for a certain product to pay with cash only(I do not have any credit cards), Best is not accommodating at all. For example: doing online shopping is the way of the world these days. This I understand, but we should be allowed to put it on hold without having to give a credit card. I get paid at the beginning of each month and if the product is not being held it has a chance of being sold. They do not have a policy that says ""the customer come first"". Now shipping products are another different egg to fry. They sometimes post that the item is not available within a certain distance from my home. What is that about? Finally, if I am looking for an item in person and find that it is not available, the sales person does not search for an alternative. It is like they do not care.",0,2

Best Buy,Worst customer service EVER,"Being a frequent BestBuy customer, I am very disappointed at the level of service I received today. What can be only describe as a nightmare experience started with a trip to this store to buy a Samsong S10 phone. After waiting for a few minutes, I was told that the SIM card that is compatible with the S10 was not in stock and I would need to go to a local Sprint store to get it. My local Sprint store is approximately 25 minutes away! So after about an hour round trip and paying $10.99 for the SIM card pack, I came back to BestBuy. This time a different saleswoman told me that the phone with activation would be $699 despite the fact that it specifically said $499 on their own BestBuy website. Now, this was exactly the same phone, same options, same service, same upgrade; $499 online but $699 in store. They said they have no way of honoring the $499 price or even price matching it. The saleswoman claimed that the $499 price is only for new line of service, not for the upgrade like I wanted. I adamantly told her that it's $499 for either new line or upgrade and that I know people who paid $499 for an upgrade. After 30 minutes, I just ordered the phone for $499 online. But now I have to wait until the online order is processed and I would need to pick it up at ""Pick Up"". That turned out to be almost 4 hours of waiting! They had EVERYTHING in stock including the SIM card that I was initially told to pick up myself! So after I waited 4 hours, I finally made my third trip to the store to pick up the phone which I ended up paying $499 for and it came with the SIM card! This was a nightmarish experience. Even if they couldn't honor the $499 price in store, they sent me on an hour errand to buy a SIM card then had me wait 4 hours until pick up was ready!",0,1

I was promised a call back, according to a supervisor he was to contact their warehouse to see if I could keep my appointment since I had already made arrangements...

Both ovens quit working and called on 7/5. They scheduled repair for 7/12 and said they would order repair parts to be pre-shipped. That didn't happen. On 7/12 tech calls and says parts aren't in and asked what is the oven doing. Told him and he said they they didn't order the correct parts and he would expedite them. Made several calls to store with always the response that they would call back. Nope, that didn't happen either. Today, 7/17 my wife called Geek Squad and they said there is no record of the parts being ordered last week the tech said he would take care of. Now, they scheduled the repair for 7/24. That's about 3 weeks without the oven because obviously Best Buy is glad to sell you the warranty but after that they could care less about fixing anything on it. What are they waiting for, the warranty to run out next year so they can charge us? Bet they couldn't get here quick enough to repair so they could charge an outrageous fee to repair?I've had it with Best Buy.We have bought other appliances and TV's from them in the past. Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll go to a real appliance store just up the road.I've learned my lesson.",0,1
Best Buy,Truth In The Eye of The Beholder,"It has been my experience that most Best Buy employees do not really know the products that they sell. A good example of this would be that it is a medical fact that I suffer from Deuteranopia (red/green colorblindness). I was diagnosed with it as a child. There are some electronics that cater to it by offering visual accessibility changes in their programs like Apple and Samsung. 2 years ago I was talked into buying an Asus Laptop and it supposedly offered settings for it, but the settings according to my husband who is not colorblind like me says that only the color red changes the hue but not that much. And the green according to him doesn’t change. To me they are both showing either brown, tan, grey and black. When I complained immediately to Best Buy 2 years ago they dumped me on Asus, and Asus refused to fix the problem and dumped me onto Microsoft who wanted $300 just to look at it. 2 years have passed and the Asus has sat in my top drawer unused because I have enjoyed the true color accessibility of my Verizon iPhone and Apple tablet. I thought about selling my Asus back to Best Buy last night but they only offered me a measly $85 for a $699 laptop, but being that my vision handicap was obviously taken unfair advantage of by Best Buy and Asus I left more upset than what I was 2 years prior. So I tried contacting Asus again and they referred me back to Microsoft leaving me holding the bag for their false advertisement considering their product. Best Buy and Asus never ran a diagnostic on it to see if was ever dropped being that I experienced a Best Buy employee dropping my HP before ever buying it. I was once told by a great man and teacher that being colorblind is not a curse, it tests the honesty and integrity of others around you who aren’t colorblind. I won’t buy from Best Buy or Asus ever again,",0,1

Finally after an hour of this, I was told that the watch I bought 29 days ago, I would need to take it into the store and have them fix it and pay for the service since it was over 15 days! Umm no, this was not a cheap watch I bought from Walmart. You sold the product, you need better defective return policies! They do not stand behind their products they sell at all and tell you to contact the manufacture. You would think with the money they are saving with outsourcing their customer service overseas, they would be able to have a better exchange policy.

There must be a tremendous amount of turnover with folks who work in their call centers because with those wait times I can guarantee you that quite a few of those calls are screaming calls by customers. I know, I’ve worked in several call centers. Now, this isn’t customer service but rather customer disservice! I gave up. When the order arrives at my house, it goes right into the car for a refund at the store and, i’ll never make another purchase at Best Buy ever again. If Best Buy thinks they can operate like this in an increasingly competitive retail environment they are sadly mistaken. Sure they survived the Amazon threat several years ago but it couldn’t be because of their customer service! By the way, have you ever tried calling a Best Buy store? Good luck with that!

Best Buy,NEVER AGAIN!,"I ordered a laptop from Best Buy 2 weeks ago. They promised the item by July 10. On both July 8 and 9 I called and expressed my concern that I had not yet received a tracking number for something coming so soon. I was assured that it would come on the 10th by both associates that I spoke to. On July 10th I received an email that the item was delayed and could take another 4 weeks to arrive. To make a VERY long story short, in the end I wanted to cancel the order. I could get this laptop elsewhere faster, and I needed it for a son going away to college so I could not wait 4 weeks. After HOURS on the phone with inept employees, )several of whom disconnected me and I had to start all over) I got a SUPERVISOR who told me she had successfully canceled the order. Thus, I went ahead and ordered the same laptop elsewhere. I then received the order cancelation email and, to my surprise, only the warranty plan I had purchased had been canceled, not the laptop. Back onto the phone for several hours..... I am told they CANNOT cancel the order for the laptop because it's ""too late"". Had they not lied to me and told me it would definitely come on time I would have canceled it earlier. They left me NO window in which to cancel this order and on top of that a supervisor erroneously told me it had been canceled leading me to buy elsewhere and now I have 2 expensive laptops coming and I only need one! The level of ineptitude I experienced with most of the associates was beyond belief. The ones who were at least polite and tried to be helpful were bound by Best Buy's ""system"" that left them no room to do anything with any order (""the system won't let us"").

Best Buy,"Bad service at Best Buy New York, unreliable and greedy...........","My son bought a Samsung 8 mobile phone in October 2017 in Best Buy shop, New York, Union Square. When he bought the telephone the sales Manager in the shop added a phone protection package called “Geek Squad plan” and informed my son that they would never charge the amount on the credit card later because the credit card was registered outside US (Denmark). But obviously I found out recently that they have charged the card monthly from Geek Squad since the purchase. Therefore I complained immediately to Best Buy by calling them. It was VERY difficult to get in contact with a person who could handle the claim – and after some days talking with different persons without solving the problem, they forwarded me to Geek squad team. I didn't know about this relationship between Best Buy and Geek squad but it is most likely same company. After 2 or 3 discussions during a week finally Geek squad concluded and refused to reimburse the full amount – only the payment for the last month protection. I think it is really untrustworthy to sell a protection plan to my son knowing that he would never be able to use the service outside US. Moreover he is 14 years old. Is it legal in US? I think it would be fair to reimburse the full amount to my son, but obviously Geek squad / Best buy try all tricks to avoid this and have even claimed that it is his own responsibility to check the credit card monthly and stop such a payment much before. So it means when somebody don’t find out that you are cheating them it is OK to continue. It is sick way of doing business and learn kids to behave like this. I think it is a huge problem that Best buy sell a protection plan to a kid knowing that he will never be able to use it outside US. That is obviously because the seller in the shop receives commission for selling the protection package and Geek Squad are greedy enough to collect money forever unless you stop them one day.",0,1

The management staff of Best Buy Union mentioned that Costco has a different deal with Samsung than Best Buy has!If you take the product to costco, they will simply return it and if it needed any repairs they wont charge anything from the customers. Whereas, Best Buy does charge the customer which makes me feel that the Geek Squad service is an additional cost customer has to incur when buying from Best Buy! Because the Geek Squad warranty which Best buy store offers is basically making money out of the similar warranty that COSTCO offer for free.I bought a TV from Costco a year back, I called costco and they said it is still under warranty and we will have it inspected with the technician. The technician visited my place and checked the TV and found out that this can not be repaired. Costco simply returned my money and didnt charge a single penny for the inspection.",0,1
Best Buy,Went out of my way to shop at Best Buy…,"Went out of my way to shop at Best Buy in an attempt to support 'Brick and Mortar' stores rather than Amazon. I purchased a brand new, professional level lap top, a keyboard/mouse combo, a second monitor and Microsoft office. Within a month of this purchase my laptop encountered a very obnoxious problem (it struggled to recognize anything plugged in through the USB ports). I called the store and they notified me that it wasn't their problem and I needed to contact Geek Squad. I called Geek Squad and they asked me for my protection packet information. I informed them that I did not have one and that the computer was less than a month old. They told me there was nothing they could do. Overall I had a brand new, very expensive computer set up that was not working properly, a third-party technical support team telling me that they were not obligated to help in any way and Best Buy telling me that they already had my money, so there was really no reason for them to care at all.I will never spend another penny at Best Buy and I suggest anyone who reads this to do the same. Best Buy will eventually follow the same life cycle of all sub-quality entities and go out of business, folding to superior companies like Amazon. With policies like the one I experienced it will be difficult to feel any pity.",0,1

Best Buy,False Advertising: Horrible Customer Service,"I bought a security system from Best Buy because Best Buy had a partnership with Vivant where the homeowner bought the system and didn't have to pay for the monitoring through the app or the cameras because 1) Best Buy made money on selling the equipment and 2) they paid a portion to Vivant so the rep in the store could advertise there is no monthly cost. Well, the partnership has fizzled out and now Vivant is charging a service fee. Best Buy said it's not their problem and no you can't return the equipment (even though everything advertised in the store is a lie). When I walk into a Best Buy store and you are selling a product it is on you Best Buy. I called customer service and the Best Buy service manager I spoke to did not listen to my concerns or acknowledge them- not to mention I had to call back three times because the rep was disconnected. The outcome of that phone call was this is on Vivant and to call them, even though Best Buy was the one to sell the product. Be accountable Best Buy to your customers, your products and your integrity. Vivant was very understanding and professional in their dealings with their customers and went above and beyond to remedy as best as they could. I still have a monthly fee to pay but, they worked with me. Best Buy should take note of what professionalism looks like. I will no longer be shopping at your stores.",0,1

Best Buy,Online purchase of a dishwasher,"I bought a dishwasher today that said delivered by Saturday. Check out went fine, after I paid the scheduling tab came up with a calendar blacked out til next Wednesday after Saturday. It wouldn’t let me select a time so I called the frustrating customer automated number that said the geek squad couldn’t be reached and hung up! I called back trying to reach an agent, wait time 38 minutes or they could call me back in 30. I chose call back. 1.5 hours I called again, now wait time is 1.5 hours and I have been on hold for 33 mins. I decided to go online and request a chat. The virtual agent couldn’t help me so she connected me to an agent name Selena. I had to use 2 comment sections to explain what happened. She wanted my name and phone number when the order was sitting in comments from the virtual agent. I gave it to her and it says agent paused. I asked are you there and apologized for my frustration but explained I had been waiting for close to 3.5 hours now. She responded pls give me a moment, I responded no problem, thx. That was 20 mins ago and she is still in pause. I did this so I could wash all the dishes I have to unload so time could be saved and hers I am, sitting with no response, no clean dishes. I could have driven to the store and back but they didn’t have this model on the floor. It still said by Saturday before I paid. I am still on hold on the phone and in agent pause online. I want to cancel and just go to Home Depot or Lowe’s. I am so aggravated that I have wasted all this time when they are usually not like this at the store. I have purchased everything from them for years! I am handicapped and thought online would be easier. Now Selena has given me an address for another chat and the phone number that I have called 4 times! I changed to new chat that she gave me and as soon as I answered all the questions it disappeared. Now I can’t chat with either. I am still on hold with my home phone and trying the gethuman ap for first time. If this doesn’t work I will cancel the order and go to another store",0,2
Best Buy,PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY AN…,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY AN APPLIANCE FROM BEST BUYUnfortunately I made the mistake of purchasing a 65 inch Samsung TV from Best Buy last July. At the same time I also purchased a two year extended warranty. About 3 months ago the picture would go black then come back on again and then go black. In addition to going black, it also was very fuzzy and the picture had lost its sharpness. I started out by calling Best Buy in Mission Viejo since the set was under the 1st year factory warranty. Unfortunately Best Buy believe it or not has only one phone line into their store. The average wait time when you call the store for anything to talk to a human is approximately 20 minutes. When I finally reached a live person they told me I had to contact the Geek Squad to take care of my problem. When I finally reach the Geek Squad they told me I had to contact Samsung. I then called Samsung and had wait again to speak to a human. When I finally spoke to someone they told me that I would have to contact the Samsung service company to have them come and look at my TV. I contacted their service company (Service Quick) and made an appointment on 4/16/19**** came here several times and proved to me it was the TV not their service and their people were great. I have nothing but good things to say about the **** technicians.Samsung service men did finally come here. The bottom line they claim that it’s *** causing the problem not the TV. They said they couldn’t do anything but they took videos of the TV and they said they would send it to the Samsung engineers and they would get back to me and 2 to 7 days to tell me whether there was a problem with the TV or not. Three months gone by, never heard from themBottom line The Geek Squad. Has been here 6 times. Three times because the TV will not connect to the WiFi system and three times because the picture goes black. Even with the 2 year extended warranty, with 6 visits by the Geek Squad they will not replace the TV. They have replaced the Mother Board twice. Replaced the cable. Replaced the chip and have downloaded the latest Samsung software. Geek Squad Visits 4/23/19 Replace cable 4/27/19 Replace Mother Board5/04/19 New Chip5/17/19 Another new Mother Board 6/19/19 Download new Samsung Software 7/1/19 7/1/19 This visit again for the 3rd time confirmed I could not connect to Wi Fi Unless the TV was rebooted.Last Friday I went to the store and spoke to the Back Office Leader (manager) He would not give me his last name. I demanded a new TV. He said to me in order to replace it (Ca. Lemon Law) they had to come to service the same issue 3 times. He claimed I had only 2 visits to correct the Wi Fi issue. I scheduled another visit for yesterday. They came yesterday and played with the software for over an hour before I asked the technician to leave. They have done this several times already. When I called the store today I spoke to Blaine. He told me that he would not replace the TV because I didn’t let his man finish playing with my TV to complete the 3rd visit on the same issue. Not what he told me on Friday BEST BUY’S POLICY ON SERVICE Bottom line: Buy all your appliances from Costco, you will never have a problem with them replacing anything At Best Buy If you purchase an extended warranty from them they will never replace your item. They will just keep coming back and try different approaches not to replace the appliance If you don’t buy an extended warranty from them, the factory 1 year warranty only will pay for parts. Each time the Geek Squad comes to your home they will charge you $100 minimum for the visit. If you need parts there are free, but they will charge you labor fees to install them in addition to the $100 minimum.",0,1

Well, it arrived within a week, but it took me another 5 days to unpack the unit and set it up partially. Then I needed to purchase some vinyl records, which took another 7 days. I used the equipment 4 times on 4 days at 30 minutes each time and noticed that the turntable was spinning slow and thereby flattening the pitch of all the music, noticeably and jarringly. BEST BUY would not give me any store credit because I had exceeded their chinzy 15-day grace period. Even though as I counted, excluding non-business days, I was just under 15 days. They told me to contact Studebaker and though the man I spoke with was very pleasant, it seems that his supervisor was calling the shots and basically told me to go f....myself....in Macy's window.

A week after that I receive a text that the order has been cancelled. The phone number with that, after a long time on hold, yields a person who sees the problem, but can't fix it. I have to take it up with the store. She does have the number for the store. The connection times out on one hold and I finally get a person after a second long wait. It turns out that my credit card was denied because they sent it through with my shipping address, instead of my billing address, which she had and recited back to me. Can they re-enter the order the order with the correct info at their fingertips? No, they can't. Can they get one of these radios in stock so that I can pick it up and settle the paperwork in one visit? No, they can't. She refers to the 1 888 BEST BUY number that I started out with.

As the games began to heat up, he started having problems with the TV. He called the store and they sent out Geek Squad.

It was very obvious, from anyone with any kind of tech experience that it was a screen problem, not a motherboard problem. He said that he’d get the back replaced and told my friend it wasn’t the motherboard. Another guy came out later to fix the screen (and the broken back panel) and said it would take up to 12 days to get in the part to get it fixed. My friend said that he wouldn’t be able to watch the playoffs. The Geek Squad rep answered with “Well, you can at least listen to it.”They did not offer a loner or a replacement.

Best Buy,Stay away from Best Buy!,"Stay away from Best Buy!It has the worse customer service. I bought a washer and dryer with two pedestals. It took me staying home five times for delivery. The first delivery - both the washer and dryer have dents. The second delivery - the knobs was broken. The third time - both pedestal was dented. The fourth time - one pedestal was dented. We accepted the washer, dryer and one pedestal. The delivery guy placed them in the garage. The fifth time, the two unprofessional men came and just dropped the pedestal off in the utility room. They would not carry the washer, dryer, and pedestal from the garage to upstair. I kicked him out of my house. I called Best Buy and they were no help at all. They said the order was set up wrong. They put me on hold for 15minute trying to set up another appointment so someone can come back and set up the set. This is the worse experience I have ever had. I will never buy anything from Best Buy again. Please don't make the mistake I did.",0,1

Best Buy,Worst customer SERVICE ever. It is an insult to say this is customer service,"After one hour and a half on the phone, I did their chat, they are shameless. Glenda answered while talking to three or four people at the same time and basically this is the chat:I have called seven times Best Buy regarding a Samsung Recirculation kit that YOUR store sold me. The store in Aventura assured me the kit would be ready within a month and checked inventory when I bought it, which is why I accepted to pay, not happy mind you, the 69.99 fee for shipping for a kit worth 71.99 dollars instead of shipping it to the store at no cost to me. 21 days after the order, Best Buy called me and told me that the Kit will come in four months. When I complained, they told me to call the customer service number which is a joke. Three times the agents hung up on me, when I inquired their names. I talked to a supervisor, Alicia, in Panama, who would do nothing, and did not escalate the complaint which is extraordinary. She floated me off on an agent in appliances who hung up on me again. Basically Best Buy told me to call Samsung. Really, this is your Best Buy promise?I want Best Buy to honor their commitments, waive the delivery fee and send me my productGlenda are you still thereGlenda what is up?Glenda A, Hi there Andrea.I'm sorry to hear that. I understand the inconvenience that may have caused you. This is not the experience we want our customers will have.Please stay with me on this. Let me check here what we can provide you the best solution for this case Andrea.You, Well, let me tell you, this has been the WORST experience of my lifeOk, please do, because this is outrageous. Your company should be ashamed of itselfIf that is the Best Buy promise, I hate to think what is the ""not Best Buy promise""Are you with me Glenda, because you are writing but not to me.Glenda A, As I can see this is related to the store complaint. To best ensure your store experience gets in the right hands, we highly suggest you to visit your local store and ask to speak with a Manager On Duty. Our store managers are best equipped and empowered to handle any concerns, complaints and exceptions.You, Are you kidding me? After having me wait I don't know for how long, your solution is to foist it off in somebody else? Really, what happened to let me help you and stay with me?And by the way, that would be lovely IF the store answered the phone or if the manager would be around when I came to the store or if anyone there would take responsibility and do their job.",0,1
Best Buy,"DO NOT SHOP AT BEST BUY DUBLIN, CA!!!","DO NOT SHOP AT BEST BUY - DUBLIN, CA!!!!POOR PRODUCTS, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EVEN WORSE MANAGEMENT. THEY LOST OUR BUSINESS!!!Absolutely furious right now after trying to resolve an issue with manager, ""Elena A"". It is difficult to explain a short version of all that has gone on but thanks to a lack of customer service skills from this manager, Best Buy has officially lost our business (we've spent upwards of $20k at BB over the years).The story: Purchased 2 computers in February 2019....one wouldn't work out of the box, got another the next day. Then that one started acting up and went dark (after 3 months). I opted to upgrade the hard drive to solid state and merely asked that after 5 trips to the store and many hours on the phone to fix this thing, that they give me a $140 credit to cover the Geek Squad cost to re-load the operating system on the new disk. Nope, she wasn't going to do anything for me...she flat out said that to me!!!I spent $2,500.00 here on 2 computers and this is how they treat their customer!!!! Oh and they ""gave me $75 off hard drive"" turned out it was overpriced $150! (their list = $429.99 and exact same one on Amazon = $296.69!!! Ripping me off, selling me faulty stuff and managers who are not trained how to retain repeat business.So, for a poor choice by the manager, they have lost our business. Over $140. Not a good move. I plan to call corporate, I am not done with this as I intend to get a credit back (or next I file a grievance with my credit card). They are not done with me yet, just so angry right now. DO NOT SHOP BEST BUY IN DUBLIN, CA !!!!!!",0,1
Best Buy,Horrible,Horrible. I bought a MacBook Air here because they were offering 24 months no apr and it was slightly cheaper than purchasing from Apple. I bought it in store but they didn’t have the color I wanted so they had to order it for I store pick up. They gave me a date to come back and get it for a week later. That’s day comes and it’s not ready. Another few days go by and I call and apparently they have no way of knowing if my computer has even shipped out to be in transit to the store. Also they already charged my card for this computer I still don’t have. Another few days goes by and they still have no idea where it is. Real helpful right? Guess I’ll call back in a few days before I flip out on them. Get your sh*ttogether Best Buy,0,1

I brought the keypad into the store from which the delivery came. When I got there, I was told that I couldn't get the full refund on the keypad at the store, because it was part of an online bundle, even though the charges did not allocate anything to the bundle, just to the iPad and keypad. I was told I had to call customer service to get the difference in the refund. Of course, when I called customer service, they told me I had to go back to the store.

Best Buy,I will never shop at Best Buy again,"I will never shop at Best Buy again. They scammed me out of $84.95 today. I dropped my laptop on the floor just enough to crack the case on one 1 corner. The computer still worked great. I took the laptop to Best Buy to have it repaired because that is where I bought 1 1/2 years ago. The Geek squad man told me that the estimate for repairing the case was $84.95 for labor and $75. for fixing the case. He did tell me that it was an estimate; it might cost a little more. I asked $10 - 20 more and he said yes. I said ok. Fix it. He told me that I had to pay the labor cost up front as a deposit. He NEVER told me that the deposit was non-refundable. I repeatedly told him that the computer worked great, it was just the case that needed repairing. He, also, told me that even though he expected the cost to be $160ish, he would put a hold of $150 on it so that there would no repairs if it went over the $150. A few days later, I receive an email asking for a phone call to discuss the estimate and that it will cost more. I call and a person says it's going to cost $371.00. I say what for; they say someone will call me to discuss. No one called. I receive an email saying that besides the case, the battery is at 3/4 % and should be replaced. I respond via email saying that I did nomt request anything to be done except repair the cracked case. Another email saying $271 plus tax total $307ish because besides the case, the hinge looks broken. It wasn't when I sent it in. I say no way, I was told $160ish and would have never sent it in for that much money. I received an email that the laptop would be back in the store yesterday. They didn't call until today to come get it. I asked the person who called, do they also have my refund. They said yes. I go to pick it up and am told that I cannot have my $85 refunded. It is non-refundable. They, also, want me to sign a paper saying that the $85 is the repair cost and that I'm satisfied with their service. I explain to them several times (and each time a little angrier and louder) that they did not repair anything so that I should get the money refunded because they told me that was labor cost. They show me a piece of paper saying that the money was for labor and handling. And that they always run a diagnostic test on computer as a matter of course. So running a test I was not informed of ahead of time and did not approve of and someone looking at it and giving me an estimate is worth $85.00 in their opinion. They, also, were telling me that they were not going to let me take the computer unless I signed the paper. So I wrote all over the paper about how they lied and scammed me and refused to give me my money and that I was an extremely not-satisfied customer. And you are correct, I was not a good example of a Christian today. But I just can't abide being lied to. And the man never even looked ashamed for lying or doing something so un-ethical.

Best Buy,This will be my last purchase at Best…,"This will be my last purchase at Best Buy. On April 15, 2019, I purchased a $1,600.00 mini refrigerator for my outdoor kitchen and bar. They quickly took my payment online and scheduled a delivery date of May 4th, 2019 between 10:00am and 2:00pm. Long and behold the delivery date arrives and Best Buy is nowhere to be found. I go online and try to track my order and that was useless because it just shows my order being delivered today. I call, I get the ridiculous automated machine and it cannot even find the order; I then try to speak to a living human and have to go through 20 useless prompts to then simply get hung up on/disconnected; I call back, go through another 20 useless prompts ( press 1, press 3, press, press, press) to finally get to the conclusion of get me a living person and finally someone picks up (half way across the world) with an a very strong accent I can barely make out what they are saying, then of course I was put on a 14:47 hold, finally I get another person to who answers and speaks a bit of better English and says to me, “your item is on back order.” They further advise that the next delivery date is May 13th, 2019. In conclusion, I wait two weeks for it to be delivered, I pay for it in advance, I waste my entire Saturday waiting for this delivery to show, I get really crappy customer service on the phone and online, I don’t have my very expensive product and Best Buy does NOT care. All I got at the end was a rescheduled delivery date nine days from when it was suppose to be delivered! Bottom line I used to buy everything from Best Buy. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars at Best Buy for both personal and business reasons, but this time, this time I have had it! I will never buy anything from Best Buy ever again, even if it means paying more, but luckily most competitors out there price match these days so I’ll use their ads and price to shop at their competitors stores and online. Only reason I don’t cancel this order, is because I have the cutout in my outdoor kitchen measured to this unit and I’m not going to change that! Best Buy is horrible!",0,1

I immediately contacted UPS to track my package but they were of no assistance so i contacted Best Buy to see if they could put in an investigation. They refused to investigate, replace, or refund me for an item I never received. To say that I’m furious is an understatement! Their customer service reps were beyond rude and not helpful at all. This is a breach of contract, it’s Best Buy’s duty to ensure that me, the customer receives their package. I didn’t do business with UPS they did and should do their best to find out where my lens is!!!!

Trying to return it today, Best Buy advised me that this was the case but, NO PROBLEM, just contact Microsoft for an easy no-problem refund.

The supervisor said that the return policy was pretty much set in stone and that I could not return the phone and need to go to a Samsung store in Charlotte. I explained to him that I didn't think that was right due to the fact my 10year old was out of town and I needed to be able to talk to him. After explaining that and still not getting anywhere I left the store. The next day I went to the Samsung store in Charlotte and was told that they could not fix the phone and that I needed to call 1800 Samsung. I called and spoke with a Samsung agent and I was told that I needed to wait on the postal information from them which would take about 3 business days. ( Granted this is a Wednesday and 3 Business days would make it a Monday and I still needed a phone to get in contact with my son.) After I receive the postal information, I had to send the phone to them and wait another 5 to 7 business days to receive a phone. I than contact Best Buy customer care and explained what happened and I was sold a defective phone and that I haven't had the phone a month and I needed it to be exchange. AGAIN told I could not return the phone because of the 14 days exchange . I also work in retail and with legitimate reasons we do take care of our customers.

Best Buy,Geek Squad protection not worth it,"I recently purchased a new home. The sellers transferred a Geek Squad protection policy to me for an LG fridge about 3 weeks before the closing.On the day of the closing, the sellers informed me they had a Geek Squad repairman in to look at a problem with the freezer. The repairman told them it was just a bad setting, there was no issue with the freezer.Three days later, there was a huge puddle on the kitchen floor - all the ice in the ice dispenser had melted. The setting on the freezer said -6F, but the freezer was barely cold at all.I called the 800 number for the Geek Squad. After being transferred 4 times, and being told they would not help me because I did not have the unit's serial number handy (I did have the Geek Squad protection policy number), I finally managed to reach a human being.He asked me for the phone number for the original purchaser! How in the world would I know that?? He told me he would not be able to help me without that phone number. I told him I had Geek Squad protection policy number, and he replied ""that will work"". It's as if they try everything possible to avoid helping customers.I asked for a service appointment on April 8, the following Monday. He told me he could only schedule the next available appointment, for April 6. At the time, I had a crew removing the popcorn ceilings in the house, and that project might not be done by the 6th. He said he could do nothing but schedule the first available appointment, but would transfer me (yet again) to ""a Geek Squad special forces member"" who would be able to schedule me for the 8th.Special Forces guy could not schedule me for the 8th, because the first guy had already scheduled me for the 6th (after I told him that date would not work for me), and special forces guy did not have the authority to cancel the other appointment. I ended up taking the appointment for the 6th, and asked for the contact phone for the repair guy. Special Forces guy gave me the 800 for LG service dispatch, since ""we just sub the jobs from them anyway"".30 minutes on the phone, transferred 5 times, spoke to 2 different people, and could not get an appointment at a time that worked for me for the *second attempt* to fix the problem.IMHO, the Geek Squad Protection policies are useless. Very difficult to get an actual human on the phone, you can't get the appointment time that works for you, you have to do it at Best Buy's convenience, and after all that, they sub the job out. You're better off not wasting money on their protection plan, save the money, and if the unit needs repairs just deal with your local appliance repair guy.",0,1

How do you send a customer broken product after there purchase was already delayed? As well as product availability horrible. Was not even accommodated for any inconvenience Best Buy has caused me. Not only that but the lady in front of me purchase a new television that did not come with a remote the customer service rep told the lady he couldn’t get her one the only thing he could do was get her a universal remote. How is the customer service so substandard and how are you guys still in business. I will be paying off my credit card and closing my account due to all the poor experiences I have had with you guys.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy Sucks,I recently bought an iPad from Best Buy. 4 days later I received an email saying if you spent up to 250.00 you will get a 25.00 gift card. So I called up Corp and they said since I bought the iPad 4 days before promotion they will not honor the gift card. I am a good customer and bought a new refridge and other thing not long ago. So for anyone reading this shop at Amazon they work with you and cheaper prices,0,1
Best Buy,I am writing to complain about the…,I am writing to complain about the extremely poor service of Best Buy's appliance delivery service. I purchased a refrigerator and dishwasher and also paid for disposal of my old appliances. My refrigerator and dishwasher were delivered ok but the installers forgot to pick up my old appliances. After numerous calls to Best Buy's Geek Squad/delivery service I still have not received a scheduled date and time for my appliance pickup. I am told each time I contact the Geek Squad that they will reach out to the delivery company XPO and I will be contacted by them to set up a pickup date. The problem is that I am never contacted by XPO nor do the Geek Squad case managers follow up to see if I have been contacted. My recommendation is buy your appliances elsewhere. You can't depend on the delivery service at Best Buy.,0,1
Best Buy,Good deals can be found,"I have made two major purchases there. The first is a Samsung appliance package 2 years ago. After a wide search I found a great package that was over a thousand dollars cheaper than what I was looking at at other places. This was partly due to the fact that the fridge and oven were both later models being phased out, but exactly what we wanted. Delivery and installation were slightly delayed, but done well. 2 years later I have had no problems with any of the appliances and am still happy with the package we bought. The second purchase was a home audio system. It was an open box purchase at a steep discount roughly at the same time. It too has been great. I don't buy a ton at best buy, but have found good priced stuff there from time to time.",0,4

Best Buy,"Hi Everyone,","Hi Everyone,I would like to rate my service experience at Best Buy Union City, CA Branch. Usually I am not a person that goes and write so many reviews but this review I was forced to write. I can't believe that how on this earth a company like Best Buy can be so unfriendly, so unprofessional, so careless. Anyways, I did order a refrigerator from this branch on Mar 15th, I was promised that my refrigerator will be delivered on Mar 18th, which was fine with me, on Mar 18th, the truck arrived and brought a broken refrigerator to install at my house, I told the guy this is broken unit, so he replies, you mean you dont want this refrigerator, what the heck anyways, I did refuse that delivery. After that I called their branch close to 6 times, each time it was over 30 minutes wait on phone, after my 6th call they tried to arrange delivery on the March 22nd, I requested them for early delivery as I had no refrigerator and now a days who can live without a refrigerator in their home, almost all our food stuff we keep inside it, anyways, they outright refused and did not listen to my request, No worries, Mar 22nd Came and guess what they brought another broken and damaged refrigerator to install, this was height, in my life I have never seen such a poor service provided by any Organization. Best Buy is a brand that people like me used to trust but with this instance it has reduce their trustworthiness next to zero. Alright, I did refuse the delivery and since that day everyday I am calling 3-4 times to their branch. I have been put on hold for over an hour and at least thrice I have been hung up on phone. I can't believe what kind of people working in this branch. I ask them to live one day without a refrigerator in their home and tell me how they feel ? They do not care, simply they do not care!!!Alright I am writing my Order number below # 1119073511915, I know this wont make any difference but if at all any senior management who is a little responsible and do care for their customer do read my massage they can look into the issue and held accountable to the right person.I paid full price for the product I purchased and I deserve a better service than this Please!!!!RajHayward, CA",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy provided one of the truly…,"Best Buy provided one of the truly worst customer service experiences of my life. They delivered a defective oven to my home, and the installers, after finding it defective, left it there. Over the course of 4 weeks, I spent over 10 hours on phone calls and chats trying to first get them to pick up the oven, and second, trying to get them to refund me. I do not exaggerate; time spent on phone/chat was over 10 hours. I probably spoke with 20 people total, most of whom passed the buck. They messed up 2 appointments when they were supposed to come pick up the oven. They finally picked it up the day before my house sold and I turned it over to the new buyers. Even their chats took about 20 minutes before the chatting got into any real substance. Phone calls are a nightmare with long hold times and incompetent, and occasionally rude, agents. I am soured on this company and imagine I will be for some time. They have really wasted my time.",0,1
Best Buy,Worst customer service turned out great in the end,"I have bought 6 - Toshiba 55"" TVs in the last three months. Bought 2 more over the weekend as Best Buy had emailed me a 10% off one item coupon. Walked into the store and was greeted by sales staff within 20 foot of entering the store. They offered to get the TVs and bring them to the front register. I was feeling great. When they rang them up, they added limits that the coupon did not state. When I reviewed the receipt, it was wrong. Called the call center as soon as I got home and they eventually forwarded me to the store to talk with someone there. They said, just bring the receipt in and they can adjust the things that were incorrect. Next day brought the receipt back and the person at customer service said, it would have to bring the TVs back so they could adjust the bill. I told him that they had told me different and if I had to bring the TVs back, they would be returned and I would never do business with BestBuy again. Brought back the unopened TVs and Rob in customer service said he could help me. He asked why I was returning the TVs , so here I go once again explaining all the events that happened over the last 24 hours. After some discussion, he brought over Zachary an assistant Mgr who was able to make all the corrections and calm me down to save the sale and provide good customer service. After my experience and reading other customer service stories, I tend to think there are two parts contributing to the hit or miss of customer service. Training, and an age group who can only communicate by emoji on their phones. Rob and Zachary at the Miamisburg, Ohio store, I would like to say thanks for your help.",0,4
Best Buy,AMAZING customer service from Tyler and Alex!,"I just got the new Samsung phone for my father at Best Buy in Burnsville, MN. I spoke with Tyler (a supervisor) over the phone before purchasing it, to make sure I could bring in my Dad's old phone and have them transfer everything. Tyler was amazing and answered all my questions and assured me they would take care of it. There was a problem with stock and finding the phone I wanted, but Tyler was creative and made it happen:-)When I arrived in the store, Tyler passed me over to Alex to care of everything and I'm glad he did. Alex had to jump through a bunch of hoops starting with the fact that we couldn't get the sim card out of the old phone. Then we had problems with old passwords and logging into accounts. I know these are details that most people wouldn't care about, but the bottom line was the outstanding customer service I received! Alex was patient giving me one on one attention until we resolved the problems. Because of these two terrific employees, I will definitely go to Best Buy again when I'm ready for my next mobile phone!",0,5

Best Buy,Whirlpool - 5.0 Cu. Ft. Self-Cleaning Freestanding Gas Range,"After our Horable experience with a Sears Frigidaire Gas range, we purchased a Whirlpool - 5.0 Cu. Ft. Self-Cleaning Freestanding Gas Range - Stainless steel Model:WFG525S0HS. This Range is the Best Ever!!! Bestbuy provided a great price and the delivery team was awesome. Even though the Bestbuy installers were trained and certified, We opted to have our Gas company install the conversion kit, install the range and adjust / test everything. We have baked several things and the oven temp is right on and consistent throughout the baking process. We love the Frozen Bake technology that is built in too. All the burners were adjusted to go as low as possible when on low so we can actually simmer on any burner. Sears never did this. I give BestBuy, their installers and this Range 5 stars only because I can't give it 10. If you want an Amazing Gas Range I totally recommend this model and the BestBuy company to stand behind it. We did buy the 5 year protection warranty but now feel we will never need it.",0,5

The door latch broke late on 2/21/19. Best Buy has refused to trade the microwave for another one as it was beyond your so called “15 day return policy”.We contacted GE re warranty and were advised that this unit is NON SERVICEABLE and they have an agreement with stores to trade these units out within the warranty period. We contacted Best Buy corporate on 3/4/19 and were advised that this is up to the store manager and that Best Buy Corporate is unaware of any such agreement,with GE.GE has offered a GOODWILL certificate to allow us to purchase another GE microwave (up to value of original purchase with reimbursement in 6-8 weeks) but this does not include sales taxes paid. Thus to obtain a microwave we will have to pay 2 sales taxes. In addition to sales taxes there is no guarantee we can replace this same unit at the same price as it was ON SALE.One thing is certain::WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM BEST BUY AGAIN..",0,1

Best Buy,Complete fools,"Several years ago I bought a computer from this place. I also wasted the money on the extended useless plan for it. At one point, it got to where after running for a few hours it would shut down. I took it to a couple of local computer shops I knew and they both told me it was the motherboard but it HAD to get hot, like after being on for several hours. So, I then took it to this place and told them how it acted and what the other places said. They said they would call me when they were done with it. I didn't even get out of the store before they called my name over the intercom. They said they tested it and it was working perfectly. They couldn't have tested it for more than 5 minutes tops. It took over 4 hours and sometimes up to 2 days for it to act up. I begged them to keep it and test if for a few days but they refused and told me if I left it there they would either destroy it or sell it.I tried to get a stacked washer/dryer combo delivered to me from here a few years ago. They offered free delivery to a town 10 miles away and a town about 6 miles past that in a slightly different direction. They would not bring the extra 4 miles. AT ALL. I offered to pay for the 4 miles, NO! I offered to pay the 10 miles. NO! I even offered to pay the full delivery fee. NO WAY! I couldn't believe it. I had their credit card and was in their highest tier of rewards members, but they wouldn't let me pay the delivery no matter what I offered.I've got 3 of these things withing about an hours drive from me. All 3 are located in small cities that have at least on decent sized university. In all the times I've been in those 3 stores, and all the others I've been in, I only found one person in the computer department that actually knew anything more than what was on the boxes on the shelves. Heck, and 8 year old can read the boxes. I don't need someone to do that for me. I need someone to explain how to do something that isn't on the boxes. Other employees told me it couldn't be done, no matter what 'it' was. This guy never had to think more than 3 minutes and then when to grabbing stuff off the shelf and drawing on a piece of paper and explaining how to do it. I never stumped him.I was asked to leave one of these places because I asked, in the computer department, where they kept their UPS devices and the person told me they don't ship stuff for people. I laughed so hard they told me to get out of the store. I told them I was sorry he didn't know computer terminology or what they sell in the department he worked in and that maybe somebody might want to educate him. This wasn't in 1982 or something, this was since 2010. A salesperson in a computer department should have know I meant battery backup and not shipping company.I advise people to stay away now. Far far away. Just like I do. I haven't been in a store or on their website in probably 6 years or more.",0,1

Best Buy,Complete Order Nightmare,"This was my complete nightmare at BestBuy #1113 Dogwood in El Centro, CA. Poor customer service, poor communication, horrible experience. I am a BestBuy credit card holder and have NEVER had an experience like this before, completely unacceptable. February 9 Appliances included;•Washer•Dryer•Fridge•Upright freezer•Stove•TvPlaced order, supposed to be delivered 2/15. Totaling $6484.96 February 11 Called to correct dryer issue (swap gas for electric). Was told that dryer would be delivered 2/20 but all other items would still be delivered 2/15. Received receipt stating ALL items would be delivered 2/20 and asked store associate and was assured that only washer was coming 2/20, all other items would be delivered as planned. Received refund of $129.90 for difference of cost between gas and electric dryer (not a discount). February 15 Husband took day off to be available for order. Around 2:30, I called and was told by Nicole that entire order was set to be delivered on 2/20. I explained that I was told it would be there 2/15 and she said she would have to call the delivery drivers and see if she could have one come back to pick up order and deliver it. I called back at 3:00 for an update and was told that no drivers were available and that they only had one driver so the order wouldn’t be delivered that day. She said that she had spoken with the Manager Jose and that he was going to try to force the order through for the next day and that I could call back later that night for an update. I called back around 8:30 and spoke with Danika and she stated that there was no update so I would have to call back in the morning and speak with Steve to see if there was an update. February 16I called around 10:30 to see if my order was going to be delivered and was told that all drivers were out but that my order was not on a truck to be delivered. The associate then told me that she was instructed by her manager Steve to call around and see if any drivers would be available to come get the order to delivery it. I was called back roughly 30 minutes later and told that only one driver was “almost” done with his deliveries and that he was willing to deliver my order but that the vehicle he was driving was not big enough to move my order so that he would have to wait for a big enough vehicle. She then said that the only vehicle big enough was in the mountains and it was about a 50/50 chance that the truck would be done delivering and back in time for the other driver to deliver my order.I was expected to just wait for my order, living in a house with no appliances this whole time.I scheduled a Uhaul rental and went to the store to pick up the order myself. The Uhaul cost me $105.36 plus $20.00 in gas. When I got to the store to pick up my order I was told that my dryer was there as well and had a short term celebration that the nightmare would finally be over. I waited well over an hour for the transaction to be completed because the associate said that the system kept locking up. I was refunded the installation cost of $75.87 and given $150 credit, a total refund of $225.87. I then went out to the Uhaul truck to find that the upright freezer was not there. When I went back in to ask about it, I was told that the order for the upright freezer was processed as if I bought it and took it home (yet they told me numerous times that they don’t carry large appliances other than the floor model and that all of them were ordered). So basically, my upright freezer was NEVER ordered, therefore I would not be leaving with my whole order. By this time I was just done so I asked if I could just take the floor model and I was told that it did not have a handle. I said I didn’t care, I just wanted my order and to get out of there. A discount was applied to the upright freezer providing me with a refund of $240.30 (a discount because the item was floor stock and not complete, not for my hassle.) The BreakdownSpent 6,484.96After discount on floor model freezer and refunded installation $6,038.89 on appliances. I got a credit of $150 for my hassle BUT had to spend an additional $105.36 plus $20 in gas for it to get my stuff. A total credit of $19.64 for items ordered wrong, not ordered at all, not delivered as promised and 2 days of complete hell while trying to move into a house.",0,1

I said how from just me unplugging it no way in hell did I f### it up it was in there care for days then it took me days to find what I needed to finish the job so I came back back with completely new part: new motherboard, new liquid color , new cpu chip , new power supply , even a new case , and all they had to do was simple take 3-4 hours to put it together and make sure it was operating and that shouldn’t take anyone longer then 3-5 hours at the most being geek squad .... uncalled for , I’ve been up there 10 times ...10 and keep getting the same answer it won’t be down today after they told me three times something different every time .... so they lied to my face how can you do that to your customer when I spent thousands of dollars a year at that store I trusted them with everything and no I lost all that trust and I lost all that money but they say it ain’t their fault that is a lie cause unplugging a motherboard won’t f### it up I’m sorry just won’t now I talked to a manger and I just can’t take this crap or lies from this company anymore I’d rather spent the 100-150 to someone who would have done it in front of me in 2-3 hours ...

Best Buy,I will never use or promote Best Buy…,"I will never use or promote Best Buy for any type of electronics again.I had a terrible experience with the purchase of a 72 inch Samsung TV and recommended full swing mounting bracket prior to Super Bowl Sunday. It appears there is no testing or research on products that Best Buys sells. I was sold a mounting bracket that (AFTER INSTALLATION) found was not appropriate and dangerous to mount a TV of this size. I removed the entire set up as soon as I completed the installation due to the TV rocking back and forth in an unsafe manner at the slightest touch. I returned to the best buy store where purchased and explained the story and the store manager (Steve) he could not have been less interested, he never even made eye contact with me. Well his resolution was to resell me a bracket at twice the cost of the original one and knock off $50.00. Now, this is a several thousand dollar purchase and I was dealing with a store manager that could care less about my problems. I declined his offer.I then contacted Best Buy Corporate, specifically, President of Services Trish Walker and company CEO Hubert Joly. An assistant contacted me after several days and his response was not even consistent with my email, no resolution. At this point, I realized I was dealing with a large company that had no intention of resolution or working with me to make things right. I returned all of the equipment purchased, TV, Bracket, Cabling, for a refund, at that point, another manager stepped in and tried to salvage the deal by offering me a free installation...I explained my prior treatment by Best Buy and returned the equipment.I was happily sold the same TV for $200 less at P.C. Richard with a delivery the day before the Super Bowl, I can't speak highly enough of P.C. Richard and would happily recommend them to anyone looking to make a substantial electronics purchase.In addition, I hired a home theatre company (Premier Home Theatre and Security in Middlesex county NJ) to provide a full motion mounting bracket and install the whole set up, (I did not want to do a second installation myself). They were fantastic and the mounting bracket could support 2 people hanging from it firmly without rocking.Subsequently, after the original TV was returned to Best Buy and replacement purchased at P.C. Richard, weeks later, I received another email from Best Buy from another corporate assistant offering me a hundred dollars or so to resolve, obviously, unaware the product was returned already.My recommendation to anyone purchasing high end electronics is to stay far away from BEST BUY, give P.C. Richard a shot, you'll be happy, they aim to please or try any other local electronics store for better treatment.If I was able to give Best But a NO STAR Rating, I would but that option is not available.",0,1
Best Buy,Never purchase anything from Best Buy,"I ordered a laptop on Best Buy.com. After paying the the order, I received the confirmation email. Shortly after they sent me an email letting me know my purchase was ready for pickup. Not even 5 minutes later they sent me an email cancelling my order. I called to speak to a representative who was rude and very unhelpful. After being on the phone with her over an hour, I still didn’t have the issue resolved. I now have no laptop and I have to wait until March 19th the receive the money back in my account. Will never make another order from there nor shop in the store.",0,1

Best Buy,Completely Unsatisfactory and Frustrating Experience,"I bought a 60” LG television in-store at Best Buy and decided to make use of their free delivery service because it would have been difficult fitting it in my car. I chose the 12pm-4pm delivery window on a Saturday and signed up for text alerts, and the salesman took my address and advised me to make sure someone was home to receive it through the duration of that window.Turns out I had to work Saturday morning, no biggy, my partner stayed at the apartment to receive it. I have very poor cellular service in my work building, this will become relevant as I attempt to track down my television.Come 4pm, my TV hasn’t arrived, and I haven’t received any updates view text. I call the store, and they refer me to the geek squad support line. At this point I just want to know if it’s still on the way, or if the delivery will be rescheduled. No one could tell me ANYTHING about its status and advised me that it may still be out for delivery. When I called the store location again, they told me that geek squad should be able to contact the delivery truck and find out why my TV never showed up, so I’m transferred again back to the people that have zero knowledge of anything. At this point I have called at least half a dozen times, and I finally gave up at 8pm, trying to salvage what little was left of my Saturday.Later that night I called the support line again and they hung up on me after saying they couldn’t help. I called again, and again, until I found a supervisor who finally told me that I was called at 11:45am (while still at work with no service) and they didn’t deliver my TV because I didn’t pick up. To highlight how useless text-alerts were, I received a text at 1:53pm that my TV was out for delivery, AFTER it had been cancelled on their end.I was never once told I would need to receive a phone call for my television to be delivered when I made the purchase. The supervisor told me to call back at 8am the next morning. When I did exactly that, they told me nothing could be done, and that I should contact the store location when they open at 11am.I assumed a physical presence would help my cause and went to the store when they opened. There, I was completely stone-walled with icy courtesy, and the employee had frustratingly little incentive to help me, even after asking to see a manager. He told me the same thing I already knew, that I had missed a phone call and that was reason enough for them to mess up my weekend. He insisted there was no way my TV could be delivered that day, and since I work weekdays, it would be another week until I could receive my TV. Not once did he try to help me, instead insisting that salesmen normally tell you that you’ll receive a phone call prior to delivery, as if that was helpful. It was at this point that I requested a refund, and he was all too happy to give it to me.This was the single worst shopping experience I have ever had. Incompetence was compounded with a useless support line, lazy delivery practices, and an icy indifference in-store. I can tell you definitively that I will never shop at Best Buy again.",0,1
Best Buy,Do not shop here,"Do not shop here! I ordered a time sensitive product 2 weeks ago from the store, and it was listed as next day delivery. They got my address wrong and i had them re ship me another product. That second product was lost in the mail. Best Buy says the only thing they could do now is a refund which i won't receive for another 30 days from now. And contacting the sender will involve opening up an investigation which will take at least a week.The product is for my work computer and I have been loosing money without this product. I have been on the phone with best buy for several hours over the past 2 weeks. I am pulling my hair out and the only thing they could do to help rectify this is to give me $10 off on my next purchase. Bish please!!",0,1

Best Buy,I will be taking my business else…,"I will be taking my business else where. I'm very disappointed in the valley stream store employees. My husband and I went in to purchase a TV from this location. In valley stream ny. We understood that they were busy, so we waited after about 10, until my husband approached a gentleman about to ask for help, before my husband could get a word out the young man (nathan) who was behind a counter at a register, stops him and said ""I'm not on the clock"" less than 2 mins a couple approached the same ""off the clock guy"" and he proceeds to walk over to where the couple was and helped them. I stood there long enough to get info on the 3 TVs that the couple had interest in. I say that to say. That's how long the ""off the clock guy Nathan"" was helping the couple. The couple asked nathan if he could even get a measuring tape so he could measure the TV. Just when ""off the clock nathan was about to go get the tape I asked him ""so you're on the clock now? He then had the AUDACITY to tell me that hes not helping them. PLAIN OUT LIED TO ME, As I watched him about to go above and beyond for someone else. I decided to take my complaint to a manager. Who had us waiting for him for like 20 mins. Because he had ""payroll to do"" the security guard had to stop another ""manager"" to assist us. Which he walked right pass us and disregarded us. The security guard Jamel stopped him and pretty much begged him to hear our complaint. Honestly I dont think the so called manager(Rafael) was in fact a manger at all. Granted we did purchase our TV. But I will be taking my business else where from here on out",0,1
Best Buy,Former Loyal Best Buy Customer,"First of all let me say that I have been a loyal customer of Best Buy for almost 20 years. So much so that I am included in their ElitePlus customer category. In the past I have always found the Customer Service to be reasonable if not very good. Today may opinion has changed dramatically to the point that I may no longer shop at Best Buy. I made a purchase from Best Buy of a pair of Bose Speakers in 2015 that have recently had one speaker stop working. The speakers have a 5 year warranty so I contacted Bose to see if the speakers could be replaced or repaired. Bose required a proof of purchase to replace or repair the speakers which is understandable. I went to the Best Buy website to try and get a replacement copy of my receipt. I could see the transaction date on the website, but there was no place to print any type of proof of purchase. I called Best Buy customer service and the first person I talked with was able to look up the transaction. They could see the order number, the date of the order, the amount of the order and the type of credit card I used to pay for the order. However they said that because the transaction was over 18 months, they could not send me this proof of purchase. They willing transferred me to another department that may be able to help. Over the course of an hour and being passed to several individuals I was told the same story. ""That Best Buy could not or would not provide me with the information that they had available"". That left me with no recourse to access the warranty available from Bose.There are too many other options such as Amazon and Walmart.com that seem to be able and willing to provide outstanding customer service. I intend to use these or other online retailers for all of my future electronic purchases.BEST BUY, you have lost one of your Elite Plus customers!!!",0,1

Best Buy,"BEST BUY OF DEPTFORD, NJ WORST STORE EVER!!!!!","I really wish I didn't have to leave a star at all, however, the system will not accept no stars (what a shame). I am a long time Best Buy customer and I will continue to be, however, I will never step foot in your Deptford store again neither will my wife and anyone else I can convince! Now one customer may not matter to you, but I am going to take the time to tell you why I feel this way. Let me first state that I have only lived in this area for a little over a year, so I have not always shopped at your particular store. I did pick up my TV from your store and a host of other items. I purchased a home theater system from the Magnolia department of Best Buy in Mount Laurel. When the consultant came to my house he asked what I would be doing with the Bose surround sound system that I had. I explained to him that the subwoofer was making an uncharacteristic sound (which is to say, it sounded blown) and I would not be doing anything with it. He asked if I had had it for less than one year. I replied, ""Yes."" He then told me that Bose had a 1 year warranty on their speakers and that I could bring it back for replacement. He then asked me to allow him time to make sure before I brought it in. The next day, Saturday, January 19, 2019 he sent me a copy of my receipt showing that I had in fact purchased the items in June of 2018 and that I could bring it back. I was at work at the time but I planned to take the speaker to the store once I was done work. I arrived at Best Buy of Deptford Saturday evening on the 19th. I took the subwoofer to the customer service counter. I explained what had occurred to your associate. He took my receipt and went into his ""supervisor's"" office. He came back and told me I had to take the subwoofer to Mount Laurel since they told me that!!!! As far as I have learned the return policy is from Bose. The professional who helped me from the Mount Laurel store didn't ask which store I purchased it from. He simply stated what could be done with defective equipment. I took the speaker to the Mount Laurel store and they helped me. They even wondered why your store couldn't help. Personally I believe it to be a matter of wouldn't help versus couldn't help. Everything has been handled no thanks to the so called professionals at your store. I wrote an email to the store manager, who of course was not there the night this all happened. Anyone who wants a better shopping experience please take the drive to the Mount Laurel store - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! The Mount Laurel store is significantly larger and they have everything! In addition to this review I plan to tell anyone and everyone I come in contact with not to shop at your store. I truly hope people listen because that was the worst experience I have ever had at a Best Buy location. Mount Laurel is not close to me, however, the drive is worth it because I get to deal with consummate professionals at that location.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy Very Bad Business Practice!!  Don't buy anything From them!,"With great intentions, I bought a cell phone for my mother's birthday, which is on Jan 26. I ordered it Jan 4, 2019 , received it almost 2-weeks later, on Jan 14--I have confirmation showing I received it that day. I gave it to my mother on her birthday, Sat-Jan 26 and turns out she didn't like this phone and wanted to stick with her old one. With that, I went to store to return it, hoping to refund or partial refund given it was open. They told me I missed the 14-days 'FROM ORDER DATE' in order to return it, NOT FROM DATE RECEIVED,"" TO ALLOW CUSTOMER TO TRY OUT THE PRODUCT.. That's infuriating because the reality is that i's impossible to time it from date order was placed, to when it arrives , which was already 11 days from ""date of order"" , then when it was given as birthday present, to then needing to return it as soon as possible. So now I lose all of my money and get no part it back. There has to be a change of policy to extend the time-frame given people buy things as gifts, they need to allow customers to receive product, give it as gift, to try the product and keep or return. BEST BUY IS BASICALLY STEALING PEOPLE'S HARD-EARNED MONEY AND IT'S JUST NOT GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE. This is HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE for electronic goods and I have decided, I won't be gong to buy anything from them ever again! It may be convenient but they don't offer best prices and clearly awful customer service!",0,1
Best Buy,TERRIBLE TREATMENT BY EMPLOYEE PALMER!!!,"Hello,I frequent your stores in Clovis and Fresno and thought it VERY important I let you know of the treatment I received today from Palmer at your 7550 N. Blackstone, Fresno store. I am COMPLETELY offended and plan to let EVERYONE know of his wrong doing! As I waited for my husband to return from the restroom, I was browsing radio alarm clocks. I picked up the first box that was left open and saw it was too big for my liking so picked up the clock sitting next to it and proceeded to read the features of the clock on the box. It seemed to fit our needs and decided to take a quick look at the top of the clock (to check the size). Just as I began to lift the lid, Palmer hollered across the way ""what are you doing?"" I was taken aback, as he seemed quite angry, as a few employees had already walked by me and didn't hassle me. I told him, ""I am just seeing how small the actual top surface of the clock is"" when he interrupted me and spoke at the top of his lungs ""put it down and never open a box"". Meanwhile my husband came from the restroom and heard the commotion and asked if I was ok. As soon as Palmer saw him, he scooted down another aisle and acted as nothing had occurred. I repeated the events to my husband and we decided to find a manager once I got Palmer's name. Unfortunately, were unable to locate a manager, we were told ""maybe they are on break"". I am completely mortified at Palmer's actions and will not return to this location again! Earlier in the day, we made a sizable purchase at your Clovis location and had a wonderful experience with a very knowledgable employee Victor, he was super and I plan to let someone know about him and his kindness.Sincerely,W.

Best Buy,Best Buy doesn't stand behind what they sell!,"Bought a $800 LG Soundbar Dec.2017 from Best Buy online. Everything was fine till Nov 2018 when they sent out updates for it and froze it up.

They tried to help me but they couldn’t fix it either and gave me a phone number to a repair shop. I don’t think that a TV should have problems that soon, had other’s that have lasted over 15 years.

Best Buy,We purchased an exterior camera for our…,"We purchased an exterior camera for our home, the sale was great and available at Home Depot, Best Buy and Lowes, and we chose to order thru Best Buy. They accepted our order and said would ship soon, after that we did not get any shipping advice and we kept checking and one day on our order it shows as cancelled. Yet online there shows stock available. We contacted Best buy to get this fixed and no response. And now item is not on sale anywhere, if they could not deliver they should have said so up front and why can they not deliver when they in fact have stock. Communication is horrible and the lack of customer care is horrible and not supply customer with product is horrible. I will never purchase anything at Best Buy any more as there are lots of alternatives out there and I will recommend the same to my friends and business clients. It is now my mission to stop people from purchasing anything at Best buy until such a time as they change policies and make things right with consumers. We have final vote and only through voting no at their cash register will we affect change. I have a email trail to support this claim as completely true and accurate should anyone need to see this which shows transactions my efforts to communicate and price paid on sale and order acceptance etc. Come on Best Buy step up and be a good vendor. Further update I reached out to Best Buy and told them about my postings online and my dis-satisfaction and gave them an opportunity to make things right. Was met with no response, they are only interested in sales and making money, not a about customer care or satisfaction.

Best Buy,Never get my business again.,"I would appreciate anyones time to read or share my story below. I do not want to see this happen to anyone...I know its long but cray. I removed the names because I do not want to burn anyone.I recently did an online order for an iPad and picked it up in store on 1/5/19.Upon returning home and attempting to set up the iPad I got to a Remote Management Screen that stated Costco was in control of the iPad.I called Apple Support and tried for 50 minutes to figure out why to no avail. It was then I decided to drive back to the Chesterfield, MO location.I was greeted by security at the door who tagged my box. He said to take it to Geek Squad.I showed GS what was happening. The gentleman that helped me made sure he had one in stock. At that point another gentleman came up and was asking me questions. I understood most of them but started to feel interrogated a bit. Fine, I understand he was doing his job.He disappeared into the back for about a half hour as I stood at the counter. Another employee asked if I was being helped, I said I guessed so and he said he would check on it for me.He came out and said the other man was checking to see if it is a stolen iPad. At this point I really started to feel like the man thought I was trying to pull something. Keep in mind that when I picked up that iPad I also purchased a $400 pair of Bose Quietcomfort headphones. I wanted those with the iPad as I leave for Iceland this week.The man returned from the back and said he could not take the iPad back as it is not the correct iPad. He said it was an iPad used by Costco. I explained to him I understand, but I bought this sealed box from your store. I have nothing to do with Costco (Sam's Club for me). He asked me if the wrap on it was Apple - I have no idea. I opened it with my car key like the other 10 Mac products I have opened. He told me I was in a hold over pattern till Monday and he would call.I called customer service who told me to go back to the store and call them on 3 way. I explained I just spent an hour there to no avail and was told that is the only way to resolve it. She told me she would give me a number. I asked her to email it to me as I was driving and was told that she could not, I asked if a supervisor could and was said she could not.I waited till 1pm CST on 1/7/19 for a call and did not receive one. I called the store and was told I would want to talk to____ and that he closes the store that night and will be in at 3pm.At 8pm last night I still had not received a call from anyone. I called the store and asked for ___ and described him (50 year old white male with braces, pretty identifiable) and the guy acted like he had no idea who that was. The gentleman last night, ____ I believe went looking for a manger but there was none there he said. He was helpful though and said he would put a note on __________ desk with my info and that he was in at 7am.I waited until 10am this morning , 1/8/19, and called the store and asked for ___. I was told that both managers are busy but _____ said he did email Apple the serial number to trace it. I was told by Mandy that someone will call me today.I called at 4pm today, 1/8/19, _______ answered again and I told her I had not received a call and asked for a manager. The manager is on lunch and she said he would call me as soon as he gets in.I have been a loyal customer for 22 years. This is the second iPad I have bought since November. I bought my MacBook there. I am not trying to screw anyone over. I just wanted a working iPad for my flight.I have spent over two hours playing phone tag with the store, wasted and hour in the store and can't even speak to a manager at this point.Unfortunately this is a big issue. I leave for Iceland in 2 days. I have waited for the product I bought from you since Saturday. I dug out the wrapper from my trash even if it is requested.We tried to return the iPad again on Wednesday with the cellophane and in the end Brittany was asked to leave the store.I received an email today from corporate, the FIRST time they have contacted me since the ordeal began, and was told I will not get a refund nor an exchange. They said they have traced back the iPad and that it was sent by Costco to a 3rd party company to refurbish...how the hell do I intercept that one???I just wanted to pass this along because I feel that if someone can buy a sealed package from any store, and the contents are wrong, that the store should at least give basic customer service and in the end make it right. I ended up buying one for my trip and video taped me opening it just to be safe. That is pathetic but who would have thought it would have happened the first time….Shout out to Best Buy for the screwjob!",0,1

Best Buy,Stay clear of Western Hills location especially,"I purchased a mobile phone and needed to exchange it. My experience with not only Western Hills customer service department supervisor as well as guest services were poor to say the least. I was sent to wait in mobile area; not to had been addressed. After having been waiting greater than 20 minutes with my teenage son a white couple walks in to mobile and within minutes guy walks up and looks right past me and my son and asks if they needed assistance. It was more than apparent that they had just walked over as we were by the desk should have been obvious we were waiting previously. We spent greater than 50 minutes in store and despite me having my receipt and best buy elite status they refused to exchange my phone without ID. My purchase was made in Dec 24, with receipt in hand and elite customer status I was well within date range for exchange. I turned around and went to TriCounty location to complete exchange. Complete opposite levels of customer service. They worked so dilengelty to get the return processed but ran into issues with my Applecare due Western Hills representative messing it up when I originally purchased the phone. Just one huge mess. TriCounty store reps and mgt are commendable. I suggest you replace Western Hills staff with all new ones who are comfortable and welcoming to Blacks and have staff from TriCounty store train/mentor them. Note: Because of not only how I felt but also my son when the white couple walked in and was immediately assisted I really should contact my legal attorney but not this time but with the hopes that this issue is addressed. Feel free to contact me",0,1
Best Buy,I would give 0 stars if I could,I would give 0 stars if I could. I ordered $7000 worth of appliances on 1/1/2019 that was processed on 1/1/2019 and 1/2/2019. I got an email that my order was cancelled on 1/7/2019. Best buy blamed the credit card and the credit card says it was already processed on 1/1 so when Best buy tried to run the total again for some reason it was denied. Then best buy refunded my account on 1/7/2019. If the order was not processed as they say why would they have to refund my credit card? Be ware. I already have cabinets on order to fit these appliances. I have talked to everyone except corporate ( apparently no one has the number for corporate). I tried finding the number online and it goes right to 1-800-bestbuy. No one has authority to do anything at that number. Scam. Now they will not get me the items at the promotional rate because it is over????!!!,0,1
Best Buy,Yesterday I went to the Portsmouth,"Yesterday I went to the Portsmouth, NH Best Buy to purchase a refrigerator for a local homeless organization. I found one on the floor that was being discounted by 20% to move it. It had holes in the door where the handle was moved from one side to the other. So, I went back to the organization to ensure that it was OK. Also, the handles needing switching and we we would have to pick it up as they don't have delivery. We agreed to purchase it and so I went back today and found it was no longer 20% off. I asked the sales person (who was awesome) if they could extend the 20% into today and so she called the manger. He (Shon) arrived and was so rude to me and the sales person - finally begrudgingly agreed to the 20% off if I took it immediately. I said I could have someone came and pick it up at 5 today and he said no. I got the lecture that they can't give every nonprofit a discount. As a family, we have purchased 10s of thousands of dollars there over the years. We will be looking for another retailer to purchase computers, TVs, cell phones, etc. Disappointed in Best Buyer.",0,1

Hours on the phone with tech support (which I joined!) and 4 in-store attempts to repair, then 2 shipments to HP for attempted repair. Problem still exists.

Best Buy,Beware of the Geek Squad warranty,"Beware of the Geek Squad extended warranty!Over the years I have literally spent tens of thousands of dollars at Best Buy and frequently purchased their extended Geek Squad warranties. For smaller items like earbuds, the warranty is great, since they will simply replace the broken item with a new one in one transaction at the store. However, I will never purchase another Geek Squad warranty for a computer or device. Because of this latest experience, I will never again make major purchases from Best Buy.I bought an Alienware gaming computer for my 11-year-old son for his birthday. I purchased the extended Geek Squad warranty. Within six months the ethernet cable port was broken and I needed to upgrade the memory in the “C” drive. Thinking that the process would be simple, I took the computer into Best Buy on Harrison Street in San Francisco. Unfortunately my assumption was incredibly wrong. First, they created a very bureaucratic process. They insisted that I purchase a $200 reoccurring “service contract.” Then they sent my computer off to their warranty center in Kentucky to have the ethernet cable port fixed. After that they wanted me to return to their store to purchase the hard drive before they would install it. I tried to make arrangements with them to pay for the hard drive in advance when I first brought the computer in, however, they did not allow me to do that.After about two weeks the computer came back from Kentucky with the ethernet port repaired. I had to go through great hassle to try and purchase the C drive over the phone to get them to install it. I was finally able to accomplish that but about a week later they called me and said that the battery was shot and they need to send it back to Kentucky for a replacement. I authorized them to do so, thinking that it should be simple and fast to replace a battery. It took them almost 2 months to get the computer back with a new battery. My son was hoping to play with the computer during this Christmas break, which never happened.To compound matters, the Geek Squad on Harrison Street claimed that they had NO ABILITY to contact their repair center in Kentucky, other than sending a written status request, which they claimed they did and also claimed that Kentucky ignored. They literally asserted that they have no way to communicate with their repair center, not even by phone, even though it’s all the same company! They acted like it was out of their hands and they had no responsibility to expedite the repair.Had I simply not purchased this warranty and taken the computer into a local computer repair shop, for a couple of hundred dollars I would’ve had all my problems taken care of and had the computer back in service within a few days, so my son could play with it during his holiday break.Beware, I will never purchase another large item from Best Buy and I will never use their Geek Squad warranty for any computers or device again! They have permanently lost my business.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy Customer Service? HAAAA!,"I recently placed an order at Bestbuy.com for an Insignia Chest freezer. Item arrived a day early for pick up, which was wonderful so i went ahead and borrowed a truck, drove 60 miles and got it home. Upon opening, I found that it was severely damaged in three different spots. While this was somewhat frustrating, I wasn't too upset and assumed the return process would be rather simple and that I would be offered an option for Bestbuy to deliver me a new unit and offer to pick up the damaged one. Instead i was given the most ridiculous customer service i've ever encountered (and i've encountered some terrible service) The first young lady i spoke with offered for me to keep the freezer and receive a 45 dollar gift card. She also said I had the option to load the freezer back into the truck, (which i borrowed and don't have access to anytime soon) drive it to the store and receive a replacement (once it arrived because they are out of stock). Thinking to my self that this was an insanely crappy offer, I asked to speak to her supervisor. I was the told i could speak with the supervisor but that there was nothing better anyone could offer me. Upon speaking with said supervisor, I found out that the first rep that i spoke with was indeed a liar as i was offered a better offer (albeit a crappy one again) of keeping the unit and receiving a $75 gift card. Oh and i was also give the option again of loading it into my truck that i no longer have access to and driving 60 miles to return it. I then asked the supervisor if she had a supervisor. She explained that she did indeed have a supervisor but that her supervisor would not be able to offer me anything other than what i was just offered (sound familiar). After this, I was also told that i wouldn't be able to speak with the supervisors supervisor until 72 hours because it was New Year Eve and that the 3 days i spend waiting on a callback would count against my return window of 15 day. This is pitiful. I do most of my shopping with AMAZON and Best Buy did a wonderful job of reminding my why. This will be the last chance i give them to have my hard earned money. Was looking at purchasing a projector in the next few month and I'm sure you can guess who will be getting my money. Def. not this joke of a business.

Best Buy,Why I Decided Agaisnt Bestbuy,"Why the 3 star rating? Firstly, Bestbuy has a great selection and a well organized store. Most of the employees are much more than willing to help with whatever your needs may be. Bestbuy is my last resort buy, why? Well, when you look at the prices of the store items and then find a better deal online....that's why Bestbuy is my last resort. I'll wait a week for what I want when I save over $100 on something. I understand convience and overhead, blah blah. But seriously? Way to go on the over priced items, Bestbuy. For example...I recently purchased some new items for my home that came up to $1729.78 with online shopping and waiting at most, a week. Now, I did give Bestbuy a try first but here was my total for the exact same list.....$2581.79! I saved nearly $1000 by simply shopping online. I do try to support my local stores but come on....a near $1000 difference! I can safely say that I will most likely never shop at Bestbuy again.",0,3

I expected this to be extended as it was the holiday period and I wasn't in a hurry so didn't matter. Went to check on status on 26 Dec. Stated there was a shipping delay and they would try to ship by 23 Jan and if they could not the order would be canceled. I found waiting 30 days to see if my order would be shipped or canceled unacceptable so I went to their chat support. Chatted with two different CSR's and was told two different stories by both. First I was told it had not been shipped yet but then was told it would be delivered today. Now how can it be delivered if it hasn't been shipped. Depending on the question I asked it was going to be delivered today or it had not shipped. Sometime I got both answers at the same time, it had not shipped but it would be delivered today. I was also told you could only cancel an online order within 30 minutes of placing the order. Of course you don't get the 30 day delay message within 30 minutes so doesn't help much. BestBuy will never compete with Amazon with this type of customer service. I have been shopping on Amazon for several years and when I encounter problems they are quick to assist me. BestBuy seems to have a customer service attitude of got your money this time don't care about next time. I have the complete chat session but don't think there is room here to share. Also went to try and review on Google but guess since they are in bed with BestBuy for Google home they don't offer that service. Hope everyone can find this review and stay away from BestBuy. This was a simple Sony receiver and is available about everywhere. The BestBuy price will never get me to use there store again.",0,1

She returned shortly and asked me to follow her to the check out area. There, one of the department manager said they could not match the price be sure it was online. I don't understand why not, you can order this on line for me. He said we will not match them. We can sell all we can at the higher price.

Best Buy,"Horrible Service, Abysmal Communication, Frustrating Experience","I am posting here because I have failed to receive help from any other contact from Best Buy.On October 14, 2018, I went to my local Best Buy (located at 1475 N Main St Ste 120, Logan, UT 84341) to pre-order the Nintendo Switch Super Smash Bros Ultimate Edition. The charge was placed on my Best Buy credit card upon purchase.On December 7, 2018, I went to my local Best Buy to pick up the console and game that I had pre-ordered; however, they could not find my order and they struggled to find any information on it. They finally discovered that my order had been cancelled by the Best Buy system sometime during the process, which had not notified me in any way, and my credit card had not yet been refunded. I asked if we could just order another one, but because it was limited edition, they would not be able to do so. Frustrated that I would now not be able to have the item I ordered and purchased, I asked for a refund while we sorted things out.On December 8, 2018, I visited the store to finish resolving the issue. I worked with the manager, Amy Johnson, and she did a phenomenal job trying to help me to the best of her ability. She worked diligently on the phone with various other Best Buy individuals and branches to find a fair resolution for the problem and my troubles. She told me we would likely need to speak to Customer Retention, but they would not be open until Monday. Again, I waited.On December 10, 2018, I called the number she had provided, along with a case number, and was told they would help me from that point onward. Instead, immediately after providing they case number, they told me that they could not help me in any way and that all issues would need to be resolved in-store, despite the issue stemming from the Best Buy online system. Again, I traveled to my store to see if I could get any sort of help. I was informed that the General Manager of the store would be there on Tuesday, December 11 to help me out. I agreed to come back the next day.Today, December 11, 2018, I once again visited the store. The GM was unsympathetic, did not care to listen to the issue, and simply told me that he could not do anything and that I should call corporate. I called two different numbers, spoke to three different individuals, and was told the same thing again and again: that my local store would be able to handle the issue. Finally, I was told that a regional/district manager would be calling me today, around 8 PM to address the situation.To say I am appalled with my Best Buy experience and the customer service I received would be an understatement. The communication between my store and corporate is abysmal, and the service and care I received (aside from Amy) was a miserable experience. I regret having purchased multiple items from Best Buy and opening a Best Buy credit card. It has become apparent to me that Best Buy has little to no care for its customers and makes any form of feedback or customer service extremely difficult to access.Perhaps the call tonight will change my opinion, but I honestly doubt anyone will call me. If I have learned one thing from my Best Buy experience, it is that they have no idea what they are doing.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy/Citi: Deceiving and Deceptive/Lies.,"Best Buy,Had An unfortunate phone call with a manager. A phone call which was a nightmare at best. Here’s the situation. Scenario: attempting to make a payment towards a Best Buy billFor the last 6 months or so, paying a bill online is an issue. Why? Every time I attempt to login with my credentials, the system doesn’t recognize my username/passThe solution to paying my bill- username: forgot pass/ answer security questions, update Best Buy new password, save pass in my password encrypted app, done! Then pay bill... Now at login for the following month... pass doesn’t work... and this fail occurs every month and so the cycle repeats. Yesterday, instead of going though the hoops of paying online, I decide to make the call: first to pay but mostly to fix Citi Portal login error...After verification a C.S.R. advises I’m late, and I didn’t pay last month. It was odd, so I checked Online Banking, because I’m never late and I know I went online to Best Buy's/Citi's credit card website last month. So... Lo and behold, no payment... thought I paid. I was incorrect. And... Just when I was about to pay, I asked a question to the Citi Bank agent... “You guys didn’t report that I was 15 days late to the credit bureau, did you?” Their response yes we did. What?? There’s no way... But they stated that they submitted the information. I advise, you guys have to remove that. Then I was asked if I wanted to pay my bill... my response was that I need to speak to a manager, because I’m about to purchase a home, and that late/missing payment needs to be removed. Rep proceeds with transfer.. I am introduced, then I get transferred... after verification, I asked rep if he was a manager... no sir I’m not... ok, can you transfer me to a manager! I’m starting to get frustrated, and here's why. I’m about to purchase a home, my wife and I just paid around $2500.00 to lock in on a property. If my credit report shows I have this 15 day delinquent payment, I forfeit our payment and our home. Plus what lender is going to trust us? Now, I finally get to a manager. Teresa, Theresa?? So here we go again, verification questions... (annoyed now). I explain my situation with my home, and that I need that delinquent/missed payment situation taken care of, and immediately removed off of my credit report. Which is when I asked her, was this reported to the Credit Bureau, Her response.... (Brutal to say the least.) Sure... we can look at taking care of this credit report situation, after you pay your bill. Excuse me? I was calling to pay my bill... I stopped to think for a moment, then told the agent, go ahead and make the payment for the whole balance $9xx.xx from my bank account, (because in my mind, I'm thinking I can’t afford to lose this home). Then she asks me... what’s the name on the account? Now I’m upset... bc there’s only 1 account, and it’s mine. Teresa keeps pressing me for the name on the account, and at this moment she knows I'm upset, and does nothing to ease the conversation. Now I'm angry, and tell her to take the payment. She refuses and after various attempts, she still insists that I tell her my name again. So I tell her... then I tell her to take the payment. She then asks me what’s the name of the bank. I’m livid by this point... I tell her to take the payment, and she doesn’t. What Teresa executes is a threat that if I don’t tell her the name of the bank she will freeze my Best Buy card and my account. You can’t understand the level of frustration I had at this point. I tell her the name of the bank tell her not to take the money out, and ask her for full name. She was silent, after asking over and over she wouldn’t respond. Then I said your name is Teresa right? What’s your last name... she still wouldn’t provide it... till finally she gave in, and provided her employee number. I disconnect...So I call my lender, wondering how this will impact me... He said, we already pulled a report. You’ll be fine. My wife and I breakdown in tears, thinking we almost lost our future home. It’s not over... so today I call Best Buy/Citi Credit Card to file a complaint. (Because it should have never gone here. No-one at Citi had any sympathy for our situation, there were no solutions, there was no help whatsoever on these guys part). I finally reach the escalation line, and tell the gentleman there my situation. What I found out was that the 15 day late payment was was never filed, because it was never reported to the credit bureau. So I was lied to. How about that. Just to make sure I made a payment. Best Buy: I’m a huge fan. But it’s unfortunate that this is how your card holders are treated. Honestly, is this how you would want your customers to be treated. I highly encourage you to review your financial options, because the method of payment extraction is poor, unfair, and deceptive. Best Buy, I've never received a level of customer dissatisfaction and disrespect at such a low point. No rep/manager had the courtesy to acknowledged my situation and at least find a way to find a way to help. Citi: I promise you, once I pay off this card, I will close it and never open up another account with you guys ever again. Consumers:Let this be a lesson to all customers or possible future customers of Citi. You’re a dollar sign. This bank doesn’t care about you, the employees and the management team will lie to you, as a scare tactic to make you pay. The weird thing was that I was going to pay, and did make a payment minutes after that first call, because I’m a responsible borrower, and I pay my bills.",0,1

The problem is that they tell you after all the deals are over and they don't even have the decency to give you an equivalent laptop at the price or do anything for you. Advertising and selling a laptop they don't have is misleading advertising. Now they want me to pay full price for the laptop when they were the ones that mislead me and for that reason I did not purchase the laptop somewhere else. This is misleading advertising, is illegal and it's horrendous customer service!I want either for best buy to charge the advertised price give me an equivalent laptop at that price.They deserve a class action lawsuit for misleading their customers like this...

Than FIVE days later on Wednesday I receive an email telling me my order was cancelled because they ran out of inventory! I tried talking to customer service to talk to a manager and was told repeatedly a manager couldn't help me if the item was not in stock. I was never offered ANY form of a Best Buy Gift Card or ANYTHING for this hassle and complete fraud of promising an item and than FIVE days later saying it was cancelled! I will be posting negative reviews and telling every person I know to NEVER deal with Best Buy because they are FRAUDS. If the item is not in stock your system needs to not accept my order and money!

When I asked if I could buy it when it comes in, they said they don't know when it will come in & can't give it at the discounted price! ALL THEY COULD DO OR WOULD DO AFTER BEGGING THEM TO HELP ME IS TRANSFER ME TO SALES SO THEY CAN SELL ME A NEW PRODUCT AT THE REGULAR PRICES!! so I declined to buy from them. Of course the item I had ordered online was paid by a GIFT CARD, so you wonder if this item is really out & backordered or if they just want the $$ from a credit card. it's amazing that with all the TEXT & EMAIL technology they have, they couldn't say via text why it was cancelled. AND WHEN YOU CALL CUST SVC THEY NEED THE ORDER # AND STILL REP COULDN'T FIND IT; SHE ASKED FOR MY PHONE NO INSTEAD. .SHE COULDN'T FIND IT WITH THE ORDER #!!!!

Best Buy,Beware Geek Squad Warranties,"I just tried to replace my warrantied phone with Geek Squad (a Best Buy service division) today and discovered after almost 20 months of coverage at $15.81 per month they wanted to charge my credit card for the full amount of the phone and also have me pay $200 for the replacement refunding it once the broken phone is received by them. This compared to Costco coverage where I also have phones with the same insurance company “Assurant” where I paid less than $100 for the coverage, once, and on a replacement phone claim, I’m asked to pay $89.27 including tax and then I’m sent the phone without a deposit understanding if I don’t return the phone within 15 days, I’ll be charged for the value of the phone. I have been a very long-term customer of Best Buy and Future Shop before that, and I am disgusted to think that my loyalty is so misplaced. Such an extreme price difference from a corporation with enough buying power to be competitive on warranties, unless they are knowingly gouging their customers. To make it worse when I called and then waited in the queue for customer service for 15 minutes as I began to explained my concern I was hung up on. I encourage everyone to think twice before dealing with this spiteful corporation. Buyer beware, and I am now.",0,1

Best Buy,Never Shopping there again.,"Address (where I shopped from): 402 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458Shopping in Bestbuy literally put my self-esteem down. I wanted to buy beats earbuds. I asked this employee (Employee A), where I can find it and she rolled her eyes and said downstairs. I go downstairs and wait in the line for a good 15 mins, then another worker (Employee B) tells me its upstairs at this section, note that she did not specify that I would find it in the register. I could not find it in that section, so I go to her (Employee B) again, and she talks to me in an irritated voice saying ""Com'n mamm! It's apple products, you cannot just find it anywhere, it's in the register."" She had an evil grin on her face. Maybe I am dumb but I am not used to buying electronics at the store, I order them online normally. So I wait in the line for another 15 mins, then when it was my turn, the lady (Employee C) at the register started helping another customer who was not even in the line. Then she finally asked me what I need, just to send me to the employee A again, who was in charge of beats earbuds at the first place! Employees are there for a reason, to help customers, they are not there to act rude and give their customers a hard time like that. Now I am embarrassed to do any type of in-store shopping. I feel like people around me would look and laugh at me.",0,1

I've spent essentially all day on chats and phone calls that dumped me or routed me back to the beginning of the line. I've explained my situation so many times (over 8) that I've lost count. No one can help. I purchased, then the price dropped $100. I asked for credit and was told to check back the next day.

He told me about it as I have been wanting one for quite a while. I went on the Best Buy website to order one. When you log on to the page a big banner comes up announcing ""Cyber Week Sale"". The price nearly doubled! I then went to their chat (which I not too sure was a real person) to see if they will honor the price my friend received. After some time trying to convince them that I didn't buy it but my friend did, Adam proceeded to tell me that the sale ended and they weren't able to honor that deal. I tried to find out why their version of a week is different than the rest of the world. He told me no less than three times that the price was $ and now was this $ as if I wasn't able to figure it out on my own. I work at a retail store myself and I would have honored the sale price and I sell item at a much higher price point. I'm sure that honoring it would not have put them out of business but would have made one more person more likely to purchase from Best Buy.

So now I have no clue where my TV is. I wasted a whole day waiting for it and still do not have it. The last time I will be ordering anything online from Best buy.

Best Buy,store would not honor sale price on shelf of item,"Today I had the most horrible experience shopping at the Best Buy in Harrisburg, PA. My brother and I went shopping, not looking for anything specific and we purchase a few items, but when we went to purchase one of the items, they refused to honor the price posted on the shelf. The item was a $50 Apple iTunes card that had a sign stating it was 20% off, limit two. While checking out Jorge went and pulled the sign from the shelf and they stated they could not honor it. So as we were leaving I seen a manager and a few employees standing by the exit door looking at said tag. I asked why they wouldn’t honor it with it being posted on the shelf as being on sale. Then the following conversation took place;One the people identified themselves as the geek squad manager Chris Lovelle.I ask him why they won’t honor it and he tells me he was coming up to the register to help. I said well no one told us a manager was coming, I am here now, what can you do for me, I asked. He proceeded to berate me and told me it’s an apple thing, and he is a manager and has the right to help a customer if he wants, I again asked how he can help me and he goes on to state that as a manager he also doesn’t need to help me it’s his choice and precedes to laugh at me. At this point he radioed for someone and I left the store before it escalated. I have never been treated so poorly at a best buy store. I can tell you I will never be back to the best buy store in Harrisburg PA, and I will communicate this everyway I can to avoid customers coming in to that store and being treated like trash.Now to continue on with this, I left the store and called a customer service number to report this. The first gentlemen I spoke to said he couldn’t help and transferred to me another person. This person identified themselves as Cha Eliana, after several minutes on the phone close to 30 minute she says she is working on sorting it out and asks me if I am still at the store, I said yes I am still there, she says she is putting me on hold and will be back. She comes back and now states that she can’t help me that “sales” will have to help me and transfers me to sales, or attempts to, I get transferred and the line went dead. So, I got treated horrible in the store and your customer service hangs up on me, I would not call that very good customer service. If you can’t tell how upset I am by how I was treated at the store and customer service, I don’t know what else to say, except that I will spread this far and wide to hopefully help other customers avoid being treated this way buy your company.Shane Gelnett",0,1

Best Buy,Cheating customers,"I bought a new mobile phone Google Pixel 2XL. For an additional monthly payment, I was offered Geek Squad Protection Total Plan for all damage cases. The manager of the departament Arno explained to me that, this plan implies replacing with the new phone within 90 days despite any damage even mechanical. On the 18th day my phone started having a problem. The charging connector is intermittent and there is no sound in the headphones, I am more than sure that this is a defect from the manufacturer. For three days I went to Best Buy 7077 Boulevard Newman, LaSalle, QC H8N 1X1. Everyone ignored me referring to the fact that 15 days have passed since the purchase and that Arno is not on area. In the end I spoke to him where he told me with confidence that the phone would be exchanged for a new one by Geek Squad as they are the protection plan. I will tell you one thing. All these guarantees and plans are lies and deception of clients for money. In Geek Skuad they refused to change the phone to a new one, despite the fact that I have less than one month and without any mechanical damages. That is, they will take it for repairs up to 10 days. Think about whether it makes sense to deal with Best Buy, it’s equal to what I bought а refurbished phone. Always read the warranty terms and do not believe what the sellers are saying.",0,1

I was told my online shopping cart prices were different than what the customer service people could see so id need to make a second order and return the first order. How inconvenient!We had a bad experience on our last visit to the closest store from us as well. We were looking at 2 tv's of different manufacturers, one of these was not on display. An associate approaches us and asks if he could assist us. I asked him what the differences were in the 2 tv's besides the brand.

Best Buy,THE WORST AND DISHONEST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD,"I went to Best buy at the Southill store (Puyallup) looking to buy a new 75 inch smart TV. The TV I originally went in to look at had a 4.7 rating out of 5. When I talk to the sales guy about the TV i was interested in, he talked bad about the TV. He took me over to another 75 inch TV that was double the price of the TV I originally went in to look at. I purchased the same TV at video only.I went back a couple days later to see if they had a adapter for my Bose surround sound. I was told that I had to buy a new receiver because I had a new TV, but my receiver was to old, and it did have the necessary hookups. I decided to wait until black Friday to buy another receiver. I went back a couple days later to look at a new DVD player. I talked to a salesperson name Eric, he was very knowledgeable at his job. I told him that I would purchase a new receiver for my surround sound, he told me that i didn't have to purchase a new receiver, he told me I could purchase a adapter. The adapter cost $30 dollars, a new receiver costed $400 dollars. I went back a day later to purchase a DVD. I told the salesperson what type of system I had, I even showed him pictures. He told me I needed a new HDMI cable, but tried to sale me one for $69 dollars. He told me the cheaper ones were no good.i hooked it up just like he said to hook it up, but it didn't work. When I went back another sales guy told me that I needed a new receiver . I told him that I was told that before , but all I needed was a adapter. He then said I could buy a adapter for my receiver and it would work. At that time I said why didn't you tell me that at first. He then said eventually I would need to purchase a new receiver. I asked him would you rather spend $40 or $400, he then start to tell me about their finance plan. I went to my car and got the receiver and HDMI cable and took it back in the store for a refund.

He offered a site visit and I agreed that would be desirable. He scheduled it for Tuesday, the 30th of October at 3:00 p.m and confirmed he and Tim would come to my home.I told him I would come home early to make the appointment and said “I will see you tomorrow at 3:00”.

Best Buy,11-07-2018 12:00 PM,"11-07-2018 12:00 PM Best Buy Return denied. I purchased a new product form my local Best Buy (Ft. Worth, TX Hulen location) on 11/06/2018. As a Best Buy Elite Member, I qualified for a 30 day product return and exchange period.I attempted to return the unopened product on 11/07/2018. The return was denied citing my consumer activity, which had been collected from previous Best Buy activity and shared with The Retail Equation.The local Best Buy store manager was unwilling to honor the product return. He directed me to contact The Retail Equation.I called The Retail Equation and they refused to help me return the product. Rather they informed me I would be disqualified from returning products to Best Buy for a period of one year.I immediately called my credit card company to start a dispute resolution process.Best Buy and The Retail Equation explain their data collection and return management process as an effort to prevent fraud. In so far as I provided a valid receipt for an unopened product within the advertised Best Buy return & exchange period, I see no reasonable explanation for my return being denied.While the information regarding possible exceptions to the Best Buy return & exchange policy may be buried, deep within the Best Buy website, as a customer shopping at Best Buy, there was no such information presented at the time of sale. It is only AFTER a customer makes a purchase, when customers can then read the fine print on the sales receipt, info inviting them to visit the Best Buy website to find and review ""exceptions"" to the otherwise broad and generous return policy advertised at the Best Buy store. The proposition Best Buy and The Retail Equation, would collect and track the data of customers properly taking advantage of an advertised and competitive return & exchange policy, to then use that consumer activity to contrive a reason to deny a future return, is not only a violation of the advertised return & exchange policy which is at every store, which may have caused customers to shop at Best Buy versus an alternative retailer, but may also be fraudulent retailer behavior and possibly a violation of the State and Federal LAW. Best Buys explanation ad reason is to ""keeping costs low"" by identifying and working to limit fraud. However, I do not see the connection between appropriate consumer product return activity and customer fraud. Best Buy just accused me of being fraudulent. Are you freaking kidding me.? I do believe that Best Buy is the one being fraudulent. I now believe their new policy is their bottom line and they no longer really care about their customers. A company can indeed keep product costs low when the company refuses to honor advertised competitive business practices and policies, which help the company compete and win business from alternative retailers. Who is being committing fraud?Best Buy should not only be ashamed of practicing such deceptive and consumer adverse activities, but Best Buy should be examined for the legality of such deceptive and possibly fraudulent business activities. I am filing BBB complaints on Best Buy and The Retail Equation. I am filed consumer fraud complaints with the Attorney General Consumer Protection for Texas. I have filed a transaction dispute with my credit card company as well, which I have very little hope fo resolution because it is a Best Buy Credit Card. I am seeking the following resolutions… I seek a full refund for the return of the item I attempted to return on 11/07/2018. A return that was denied despite me presenting a valid product receipt within the advertised Best Buy product return & exchange period.To have my consumer data removed from The Retail Equation database.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy sucks,"Best Buy sucks. Ordered a dishwasher in September 2018. Didn’t arrive when promised. Customer service is horrible. Eventually got it installed weeks late. Against my better judgement , because they allegedly could get us a new wall oven quickly when ours broke, I ordered from Best Buy again. Night before scheduled delivery, got a text that changed the date by a week. No call, no explanation. Still don’t have the product as of this review. STAY AWAY FROM BEST BUY. THEY STINK",0,1

But the installation experience was the worst I have had in 20 years of buying appliances.They did not show up in the time range of our appointment, for the next 4 hours they gave one excuse after the other. I finally had to threaten to cancel the order to get them to agree to come out the next morning.I later wrote directly to the store manager detailing the problems and 2 weeks later, still have received no response, apology, etc. We will be buying our appliances somewhere else next time.",0,3
Best Buy,Best Buy Lies About Shipping and Won't Fix Their Problems,"Ordered an RTX 2080 1 day shipping: Turns out I got an OUT OF STOCK model, they even decided to not inform me its out of stock and decided to send the order to the manufacture. Well turns out until the item is actually shipped (or somehow expires according to them next week which they said might not even happen) you cant refund or change the product. They straight up lied to me and said I could also do a 18month finance plan to get another RTX while they handle the one that is delayed, well I was lied to I drove 40min to Best Buy and made an butt out of myself, went back in after calling them back and they assured me I should be able to get it, made an butt out of myself again. They did multiple credit reports on me to try to increase the credit limit and all of this work and they couldnt even just exchange it and handle the funny business themselves!Everything is left to the customer to eat, we have to deal with the delayed shippings, we have to eat the extra cost, if we are lied to, OH WELL WE CANT DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU SORRY WE DONT TRAIN THE CALL CENTER! What pisses me off most is that I was right by an RTX 2080 and all they had to do is own up to their mistake and switch them out, nope I gotta wait potentially a month. I am most likely NEVER going to buy another product from them again after this. Will also cancel my credit card after I pay off this purchase",0,1

I don’t think that will resolve my problem.CSA: Then we recommend you go to another store. Me: So your store managers don’t have supervision? CSA: That’s all I can recommend.

Best Buy,Be warned...,"There can only be one reason to buy from a shop rather than the internet. For expert advice on the product you want.I wanted a laptop and a smart phone. I know about laptops so I go there first and find my choice is bust which doesn't instil confidence, and the alternative offered for sale is not in stock and no other local Best Buy has one. I travelled 10 miles to be told that. Why have it on display for sale if Best buy hasn't got any to sell?Like most Sarasotans, I'm in my 3rd age. I don't like the ever changing technology so I've avoided smart phones but I now find a need. Something I can use for as a satnav whilst I am travelling. Ideally google maps.So I choose a 'best buy' phone and ask for it to be set up with AT&T on the 10 cent a minute plan I have with access to the internet so I can use google maps on the move. The salesman doesn't seem too pleased at being asked to set up it, but he does so to get the sale of a smart phone, sim card, and $15 prepay At&T card.I walk out of the shop excited with my new gadget but immediately discover the phone and service best buy sold me cannot cannot search for anything.So I go back in the store and ask the salesman to sort the problem or refund me. He then tells me its all my fault. I got what I asked for.But I didn't get what I asked for. He then spends time arguing between the two options, I don't know why, and repeating its all my fault. No attempt to find a solve the problem. So I ask to speak to his manager, and which he insists he has no manager and returns to talk all over me again debating the two options and what he claims my fault. By this time I'm feeling harrased. I ask again, and the manager is there. It's seems the manager has been watching from a distance. The manager spends some time privately talking to the salesman and then comes with the salesman to say its all my fault without asking me anything! Now I'm feeling ganged up on, so to avoid what I feel is growing aggression, I'm old man, I ask to speak to him in private. The manager then talks over me, but admits he knows nothing about smart phones. He then says the internet cannot be accessed on a 15 cent per minute AT&T plan. But AT&T tell me I can. Then the manager says the salesman can show me how to access Google maps for my journey. Fine that's, what I asked for half an hour before. A solution to the problem.They then spend 25 minutes downloading google maps for my journey but fail so refund me. But they don't refund the $15 AT&T card they used to download Google maps. I tell the manager if he doesn' refund in total, I'll take advice from my bank and attorney. The manager's parting shot was he and his staff won't be bullied by me! It seems to me I was the one mislead, sold the wrong product, then harrassed and intimidated.Be warned. If you don't know exactly what you want don't rely on accurate and impartial advice from Best Buy. If you are not going to et that it's much cheaper on the internet.This review does not reflect on AT&T. whose cellphone reception is the best in my area and their customer service is patient and informed. A pleasure by comparison. Best Buy has been bankrupt before. With service like that Best Buy is at risk of going bust again. All because Best Buy doesn't ensure the products they have on display are working, or they have in stock to sell, and its staff don't know what they are selling. Maybe Best Buy's shares are not a best buy. This review does not reflect on AT&T. Their wireless service is the best in my rear and their customer service is excellent and informed.",0,1

My rationale was that all I wanted was a armor screen for my cell. I had it installed in the store feeling pretty safe. It is a lifetime guarantee. I did not bother to double check their work. I stuck it into my pocket and left. When I took my phone out that evening i discovered a broken corner. It took me 2 days to go back to the store. I asked to have the Armor to be replaced since it was applied wrong by their employee and no I did not drop it. I was told in no uncertain terms that I would have to activate the guarantee and then ask for a replacement.. i was clearly reminded why I have not been in a ""Best"" yeah right Buy in over 5 years. Your customer service following the sale is pushing Iying to a fine art. YOU HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Do you know that when a customer service has a good experience they tell 7 people. When they have a bad experience they tell 10. I plan on telling many more than that .You people should be embarrassed. My next post will be to Facebook.

Best Buy,Do not buy a Smart Phone from Best Buy,"Do not buy a Smart Phone from Best Buy! I bought a new Samsung Galaxy S8 on Sunday, October 13, 2018. I put it in my purse and drove home. When I showed the phone to my friends, they noticed that the screen was broken. This was on a two hour drive with my purse not moving. I looked online at the Return policy which said I had 14 days for a return, exchange or repair. Took my phone to Best Buy Castleton store only to find out that it did not apply to my Brand new phone. I was told when I walked out of the store on the date of purchase, it was my problem and they would do nothing. $600.00 phone and it is worthless. Oh and a repair through their Geek Squad-approx. $400.00. Do not buy a Samsung Galaxy S8 and especially Not from Best Buy.",0,1
Best Buy,bought an open box stove on the floor…,"bought an open box stove on the floor at my local BB on 10/5. Scheduled deliver and install 10/13. tossed my kitchen the night before to make way for the installation. Morning of 10/13 delivery company calls and says stove was not at pickup location so no delivery (store is 5-6 miles from my house). Called BB to find out what was going on...no answer..Amazon always answers! Drove to the store. Kid says stove is not in the back...I'll send an email to the Escalation Team! Email!!!Anyway they lost the stove ...nowhere to be found..disappeared...was shipped to jersey and then back to ny distribution center (i did mention my house is like 5-6 miles from the Patchogue store). We're working on it We've reschedule for 10/22. But wait, I told you I needed Saturday delivery on 10/5 because I work during the week. ""We can't do Saturday"". Ok, the wife is flipping out - I'll take a vacation day - 10/22 it is!10-19 text messages please be prepared for your delivery. Then store manager calls....Sorry, can't find the stove. Let me offer you a lesser quality new stove that about the same price you paid for the open box. Guess they taught that at BB customer service school. Make the customer pay for your screw ups..don't ever step up and do the right thing (can anyone say Sears!)Spoke with ""Corporate"" case manager... the girl who is handling your case is away from her desk and so is her manager. I can't do anything because I can read the emails regarding the case...I'll send her an email telling her you called. after much cursing,,,would you like her direct.....(nope) email..thought she was going to say phone number.I am an ""Elite Plus"" BB customer. have spent thousands of dollars there. There is not one employee in the whole place who cares. Customer retention is not something they are even cognizant of. BB is the failed model. They have a bunch of kids who are in no way invested in the success of the business. If anyone at BB can figure this out before Black Friday I'll give them 2 stars.",0,1

Best Buy,Pathetic Customer Service and not adhering to committment,"In my life I have never witnessed such a low level of customer service and sales which Best Buy (Mavis/heartland branch) in Mississauga, ON, Canada. They really stooped low.I migrated end of July 2018 and bought quite a bit of stuff from them. One of them was a standing freezer with additional warranty. The guy who delivered on Sept 5, 2018 (on my birthday) was so rude and did what he felt like doing rather than following my instructions when delivering the freezer and then left without delivering. This behavior left me embarrassed at home, near my apartment security and tenants who watched. I was left in anxiety.Later I called on best buy number and revealed the whole story. empathy was only in one sentence which meant nothing. It was a formality. No one did anything, no action and I was always kept on hold for long minutes so that I close but I was persistent to get my complaint locked. They promised to call back for a solution and have it delivered but no one called. After days of follow up one person from compliance called that we are looking into it and will get back with the result but in vain as of today Oct 11, 2018.With no car as I have recently migrated and bad toe as did not have a OHIP cover I came in a bus to the shop. Revealed my story to Anil the store manager who showed empathy and mentioned to reimburse the money once the product is delivered to your house and deliver the product except tax and extended warranty amount. Andrew reconfirmed and when I asked that next week when I come for reimbursement and you both are not there what will happen to which Andrew said all is on email no worries. The day I came in bus with a bad toe, there was no Anil and Andrew. The guy who was talking to me was helpless and tried to contact Anil from his cell by sms and best buy number but Anil did not pick up. After an hour he responded by sms he is busy shopping with wife. I told the person to tell Anil I am here and to resolve but Anil refused. Anil also went back on his commitment that on delivery charges will be waived which in the first place there was none. when I said that the guy showed me delivery charges and said at that time the sales person must have not charged delivery but gave discount from the employee balance with permission of the manager. This is the state of misleading a client.It was my word against Anil and I stayed in hope that Anil would chat with me but he refused as he knew he would be caught lying. So much happened but Anil as of today never bothered to call me also. It is now not about money but integrity is on line. I can imagine what best buy could behave if product got bad.I would say plz try to avoid best buy at all cost and go only if there is no alternative which is next to impossible.I am still disturbed and wondering how Anil can sleep well after such miscommittments. he never called me back.My friends and I vouched never to go to best buy.",0,1
Best Buy,ordered a Bosch dishwasher ($967.00)…,"ordered a Bosch dishwasher ($967.00) and was told that it was to be delivered 1.5 weeks later. I was given a five hour window then a 12 hour window, then a six hour window, then finally back to a 12 hour window. The day before I had not heard from BestBuy so I called and was told that it would be there between 7 am and 12 noon, delivered and installed. When it didn't arrive I called Best Buy to say that I had to work that evening and was told that it could be as late as 7 pm. They said that nobody at Best Buy would give less than a 12 hour window and I must be mistaken or that it had changed at the last minute. No apologies for my loss of a vacation day from work or for ""not showing up at all"". They lied to me about the delivery and then said, ""just do what everyone else does and get your money refunded when they don't show"". Also on your order form, they do not include a telephone number and try to get you just to look at your status online. You will need to search the internet to get a number so that you can wait 20 minutes to speak with a customer rep. They don't want you to contact them. Its been more than 10 years since I last ordered from Best Buy and I thought maybe they had changed. They have not. Customer service is worse today than it ever has been.

Best Buy,DO NOT buy from this company,"DO NOT buy from this company! Does not even deserve one star. Unreliable, unresponsive, irresponsible. You DO NOT want to have to deal with this kind of headache. We bought 2 fridges and a set of washer/dryer from them back in August. Paid upfront, only after the payment did they tell us that the appliances can only be delivered in October (6-7 weeks wait time). Since it was already all paid for, and they were appliances we wanted, we accepted to wait. The delivery was scheduled for Oct 2nd, and we were supposed to receive a call from Best Buy to give us a 3-hour window on the delivery day. However, they never called. So I called them, only to be transferred 3 times before someone put me on hold for 56 minutes. She then confirmed the delivery with me, but said she could not narrow down to a 3-hour window because the delivery company could not confirm that. So we had to wait all day on Oct 2nd, from 8am to 9pm (13-hour window). Oct 2nd came, no delivery, no call. We waited ALL DAY as they could not provide a window. Finally, they never came. We called and were transferred 8 times before they gave us an « escalation case number » and said someone from home delivery will call us within the next 2 days. Two days later, all we got was an email saying that they DO NOT know when we will get our appliances, and will contact us again when they have an ETA. No apology, no explanation. DO NOT buy from Best Buy unless you are looking for headaches, frustrations, and indetermined wait time!!!!We cancelled our order. It was over $6000cad. Still waiting for our refund. I was also told that their headquarter will contact me to discuss what happened, the call of course has not happened either. They are UNRELIABLE, and sell products they DO NOT have in stock. Again, PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND THE GRIEF. Do NOT purchase or order from BestBuy.",0,1

Best Buy,"Damaged Product, unprofessional service","Came home from my Military Service and decided to purchased a refrigerator from Best Buy back in June 2018 upon delivery, we noticed the freezer door which was the bottom part of the refrigerator was dented. I called customer service, at which time they stated they will order a new freezer door for me (This is back in June). They finally called and stated they have my new freezer door and would like to make an appointment with me to come by and deliver it. Therefore I schedule my work around them coming to deliver the door, however once on location, the best buy employee states they ordered the wrong color door they delivered a white door and my fridge is stainless steel, so they make another appointment with me to deliver my freezer door. (Once again having to adjust my schedule and work around getting my new freezer door). So, the day of my delivery the best buy employee calls me and states they still do not have my door yet, and thus makes another appointment for two weeks later, stating hopefully we will have it then. At this time I contact Best Buy (Geek Squad) customer service to inform them, that it is now the end of September and I have yet to receive my freezer door, I have missed work and changed my schedule around numerous on behave of them. They inform me that now the Freezer Door is on order and the ETA is for the end of October. I was baffled, why would they Best Buy Technician schedule an appointment with me for October 11th once again making me change my schedule around when they know the part is not even going to be delivered. I had to express to Best Buy customer service that people, especially paying customer’s time is valuable, and what they are doing is unprofessional. Best buy then stated they would like to compensate me by giving me a $65 gift card. Wow $65 dollars?? When I purchased a 1500 dollar refrigerator, and had to change my schedule around and miss work on behalf of Best Buy, truly appalled by the way they conduct business.

Best Buy,Blatant DISCRIMINATION against pregnant…,"Blatant DISCRIMINATION against pregnant customer, WASTED service appointment, POOR customer service, system issues, ZERO FOLLOW-UP from Best Buy, overall a complete NIGHTMARE! BEWARE!After 2 1/2 weeks of my order having ""back end system issues"" (the representative admitted it was Best Buys fault), Best Buy couldn't figure out how to push the order through. Not only did they admit it was their fault due to their systems, they had no suggestion on ways to accommodate me or fix it, instead I had to call them every single day to check on the progress of my order. When I would call, I would be on hold for a ridiculous amount of time or I would be told that someone would call me back, which most of the time they never did and I had to follow-up AGAIN. They kept claiming that they couldn’t locate my washer & dryer but even when I suggested that they send me a washer and dryer that they COULD locate, they still were not willing to help me. After multiple delivery confirmations were set up and no one showed up to deliver the product, I finally suggested that we cancel and resubmit the order, which is something they should have suggested over a week and a half prior. Once the order was resubmitted, the first delivery crew finally came with the washer and dryer. Once they came in and saw the machines needed to go upstairs, they proceeded to use my pregnancy as a way to get out of the haul-away of my old washer and dryer and the installation of the new washer and dryer. The delivery man used the excuse of saying I needed an adaptor for the gas line, in order to connect the new washer, which was in-fact false. He refused to unscrew the attachment to see what size ""adaptor"" I needed, or to see if the connector I had would work. He specifically said, ""You are pregnant, so we can't unscrew the gas line with you here."" Which is also, in-fact, a lie. The gas is no different from the gas that pumps into your stove or stovetop which is safe for pregnant women to be exposed too. Google it!He specifically used my PREGNANCY as a way to NOT do his job aka install the appliance that I had already been waiting over 3 whole WEEKS for. He ABUSED the fact that me, the customer, was PREGNANT and he KNEW that he could get away with not doing his job because of a ""safety hazard"", which in fact is NOT a safety hazard. He blatantly made multiple comments about me being pregnant to ensure that he would not have to move or install the new washer and dryer.They left both new machines in the garage and waited for the next crew (almost a week later) to do the job. Once the new crew arrived, they told me the adaptors were not needed, meaning I COMPLETELY WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY by going to the store on a wild goose chase to buy an adaptor after the first delivery crew told me that I needed them. The best part is, I actually overheard the crew member that showed up the second time, call his manager and say “you remember me telling you about some of our workers being lazy, they told her she needed an adaptor and she didn’t.” So even he knew that the first crew was just being lazy!!! If the first delivery guy would have unscrewed the gas line the first time, I would have seen that the adaptor was not needed and he would have had to install them for me. Instead, HE USED MY PREGNANCY AS AN EXCUSE to not unscrew them ensuring that he got away with not doing his job & putting it off on the next crew to show up. After going to buy them, after spending over $2300, after having both the back-end system issues that was 100% Best Buys fault, and the discriminatory delivery people, the ONLY thing Best Buy offered was a $150 gift card, which is completely unacceptable. Apparently, Best Buy doesn’t feel obligated to handle the problems they cause and they believe that $150 is acceptable compensation to make up for DISCRIMANATION and exploiting a pregnant women. So now that I’ve wasted time at work speaking on the phone with their completely unhelpful representatives, every day, for over three weeks – I now have to escalate my issue, yet again, because even corporate isn’t willing to make things right. My suggestion…go somewhere else – Home Depot delayed my friends washer and dryer order for around the same timeframe, with less issues and no discrimination, and comp’d her 25% off her ENTIRE ORDER – on a cheaper washer & dryer set. AT LEAST HOME DEPOT IS WILLING TO FIX THEIR MISTAKES. SHAME ON YOU, BEST BUY. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!",0,1

Best Buy,I am on the Geek Squad monthly service…,"I am on the Geek Squad monthly service plan, after 1 1/2 years I needed to use them to set up a soundbar which I did not purchase there. They came and installed it, seemed to be working, charged me $84.00 then they left. When I turned the TV back on, I had no sound. They came back a week later, did something, got it working and left. Again, when I turned it back on - no sound. They came a third time, unplugged it, plugged it back in and it was working. Said it was a power surge. They started to leave, but I asked them to wait and turn it off and on again. Sure enough it didn't work. They said it was defective and left. I read the troubleshooting manual, and it was in demo mode. I held down 2 buttons and 5 seconds later it was working and has worked perfectly since. 5 Technicians couldn't figure this out??? They are too smart and arrogant to read the instructions!! I asked for my $84 back and was told that they did what was requested and installed it! I will never deal with them again. From now on, it will be small electronics places for me",0,1

I know best buy goes through a different delivery company and they are AWFUL. they have been to my residence 3 times, first with a scratched washer then the second time they came out they had lost screws from the first delivery causing even more delays. The workers had no idea what was going on the first two times, one even asked me if they were putting the washer on top of the dryer. The third crew was the ""Clean up"" for everyone else they admittedly said so. Today as we were finally getting everything installed the dryer they had left was dinted.

Best Buy,Purchasing a cell phone with a Best Buy gift card,"I purchased a Best Buy gift card for my Mother to purchase a new cell phone. We went to our local Best Buy at 4413 Birkland Pl.Easton, PA 18045 and were taken care of by Patrick. Everything went well with our selection and purchase until we tried to pay for the cell phone with the gift card. We were informed by Patrick that we could not purchase a cell phone with a gift card. I checked the gift card and there were no such restrictions listed. I do find it hard to believe Best Buy would place such restrictions on their gift cards, but Patrick checked with a supervisor who said the same. I was going to make the purchase with my debit card and then decided not to spend my money at Best Buy. We left and purchased the same phone at WalMart. Unfortunately I now have a Best Buy gift card that I really don't want.",0,2

Best Buy,Best Buy Your Major Appliances Elsewhere,"Our home is being repaired after the Harvey hurricane flood. We bought a high end SamSung replacement refrigerator and GE Monogram range from the Best Buy in Sugar Land, Texas. A nightmare of incompetence, cross-functional blame and damage ensued.Range delivered two months before install awaiting flooring cabinet installation. When they went to install, they discovered they did not have the correct connection kit for what the sold us. We got bounced around on promises for a follow-up up installation. Promises made on appointments and times of arrival were not kept. Spoke to a Corporate employee named Jesse, who said he would make sure it got handled but that that they did not think the original connection kit was the wrong one and asked me to go buy it at Home Depot and they would re-imburse me. I did. Having had enough of the broken promises, I went over to the local Best Buy where I bought this range and got reimbursed for the connection kit and was told by the store manager ""they should have had the correct installation kit with them when they came to install the range""! The crew came the next day. They said although I had the right kit, another fitting needed to be replaced and I would have to buy another fitting and schedule another installation team to finish the install. These guys damaged one of the new cabinet doors. Had to buy another $30 connection kit to get the single fitting.We had to delay the counter installation because Best Buy would not expedite someone back to finish the installation. Finally done two days later - after rescheduling yet again another ""show up"" time promise. All told, weeks delay, multiple broken promises on appointments, utter Three Stooges level incompetence at the local, warehouse, 3rd party service and Corporate levels added to the cost of replacing a new cabinet door, a second connection kit, two trips to Home Depot and one trip to Best Buy. All of this to get these people to do what should have been done the first time correctly.I would eat broken glass with a spoon before I would buy major appliance from this store chain that is riddled with anti-customer service execution from one end to another and, by the way, screens reviews submitted about their local stores for the website to put in only 4 star or better reviews.Buyer Beware 0f Best Buy",0,1
Best Buy,I bought a 65 inch Samsung television,"I bought a 65 inch Samsung television, took it home, and it did not work. I repackage the television hauled it back to Best Buy and spoke to the manager on duty. I was told, no problem we'll just exchange it for you. I took an entire day off of work went to Best Buy shop for the television and all I was offered was a polite Exchange. The manager took the television to the customer service department, removed it from the packaging, plugged it in and begin troubleshooting the television instead of just exchanging the television for me. At this point I became upset told him not to worry about replacing the television I then requested a refund. He took 15 minutes to issue me a credit then he followed me out of the store saying have a nice day sir sarcastically to which I said f. U. And then he says God bless you sir, have a nice day sir as sarcastically as humanly possible.

Best Buy,Delayed Pre-order,"I usually don't have an issue with BestBuy, but I pre-ordered a game this past April and when you pre-order a game then you're guaranteed to receive it on time, since it is reserved. So after 5 months I receive an email saying my order is delayed! They literally sent an email the night before the release date saying the order cannot be fulfilled on time! I wasn't the only one to be affected, but this shouldn't had happened in the first place. The order was eventually sent out, but the entire purpose of a pre-order is to make sure you get it on time. This is the first time I have ever gotten into a pre-order ordeal, but to add salt to the wound, when I pre-ordered the game I was also guaranteed pre-order bonuses (digital freebies) but they never even sent me the bonus code, I had to call their CS number and had to waste more time on this one order. Honestly don't think I will pre-order from BB ever again if these are the hoops I need to jump through to buy things.",0,2
Best Buy,Do not buy anything from Best Buy and expect it to be delivered on time!!!,"If I could give a negative review I would. I have been on the phone with customer service a total of 8 hours over the last two days trying to get a fridge that I ordered a month ago delivered!!!! It was supposed to be delivered yesterday and everything was scheduled for about a month for that delivery date. I called and they said because of a glitch in their system it would have to be delivered today. I was mad but figured one day would not be too bad. It was supposed to be delivered today and now they are saying it will be another 5 days until delivery even though I have changed plans and waited at home for almost two days for delivery.I canceled the order of $3,000 and took my business to home depot, ordered it and it will be delivered this Friday. Best buy has lost my business forever.*Update:Home Depot delivered 5 days later, they came on time and provided amazing service. They were in and out quickly and even called a few minutes beforehand letting me know they would be early if I wanted it delivered early.Bottom line, buy from Home Depot.

Best Buy,We have had the worst experience ever,"UPDATED*We have had the worst experience ever. We purchased all new appliances for our kitchen. A refrigerator, stove, microwave and a dishwasher which was on back order.Upon delivery, the refrigerator was dented, unfortunately it was so small I didn't see it until the delivery team left. So best buy said they would replace the unit but asked if the door could just be replaced. My husband specifically DID NOT want the door replaced, he told 2 reps that, and assuming that this was documented he didn't see any reason to mention it to me. When the new fridge was delivered the delivery guy said ""we can just replace the door"" so me being unaware of what my husband had specifically requested from best buy, I said ""ok great!"" So after this was all said and done the delivery guy said nowhere in his note did it say NOT to replace the door and that we specifically wanted a whole unit!!! Why on Earth was this information not noted in the paperwork?!Then we have the stupid ordeal with the dishwasher...The dishwasher was scheduled for the end of August.Without even contacting us to see when would be convenient for us to reschedule, we receive a text saying that it's being delivered a different time and day which we were going to be out of town!!! You can imagine our frustration by now. When my husband calls to get to the bottom of this and express his disappointment and properly reschedule, we were told someone would call us back that evening... No one called. We had to call and electronically set up a new time and day. Now, when we purchased these appliances At best buy we split the cost between 2 best buy credit cards. This was discussed between the sales rep and the credit card rep over the phone. Great, done deal. No worries, right?...Well we now receive a bill in the mail stating that we are over our limit on the one card and now have to pay $1000! Because the payment WAS NOT split between the 2 cards!!!... We usually buy all our appliances from Lowe's but we took a chance with best buy and we are completely disgusting. I have recommended to 4 people looking into purchasing appliances to NOT GO THROUGH BEST BUY!!! And lastly...Today is the day the dishwasher is supposed to be delivered, between 8-12. Well 12 comes and goes, so at 12:45 my husband calls to find out what the deal is. The delivery guy says he had already had that time slot filled when we rescheduled our delivery! Because, remember we had to do the automated reschedule cause nobody would call us back when they said they would!So my husband asked why he didn't call us to let us know that he was now going to deliver it at 3 (which totally ruins my schedule) he told my husband that it's not his job, the scheduling department has to do that... Disgusted at how everything has panned out. Wish we would have stuck with Lowe's.UPDATE:At 2:15 the delivery team that just drove all the way from Chicago shows up, WITHOUT THE DISHWASHER! According to their paperwork they thought it was already delivered and they were just installing. Again, the proper relaying of Information is pathetic. So here we are, with no dishwasher, wondering how long this will take.***Furious***Another UPDATE...Thursday the 6th was when we were supposed to get the dishwasher.NO ONE HAS EVEN TRIED TO CONTACT US. BEST BUY IS HANDS DOWN THE WORST COMPANY. AND IS RAN BY A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.",0,1

Best Buy,ScamArtists,"On Thursday August 2, 2018 I purchased a MacBook Pro, thunderbolt ultra drive, and a laptop stand from the Salem NH Best Buy. I had the MacBook Pro on one receipt and the thunderbolt ultra drive along with the laptop stand on a separate receipt. When I got home I placed these items in my office. On Sunday August 5, 2018 I went to open the box with that the laptop stand came in to find an empty box, I immediately called the store on Monday morning and notified management of the situation, they stated when I came down they would take care of it. That week August 6, 2018 through August 15, 2018 I was not able to make it down to the store but I knew that I had 15 days to make any returns so I made it down to the store on August 16, 2018. On August 16, 2018 I decided to return the MacBook Pro, thunderbolt ultra drive, and a laptop stand. When I arrived at the store they had no problem returning the MacBook Pro. When I had told them about the situation I had with the laptop stand they had called the store manager (Carlos) and he told the cashier that he would take it back with no problem. As he walked away the cashier scans the ultra drive and the laptop stand and wasn’t able to do the return. She tells me she was going to give me store credit.. I told her why would you give me store credit? She replies “ because it’s over the 15 days” what are you talking about!? I had no problem with the laptop and I purchased it on the same day so why would I have a problem the other two items. At this point I told her to call the store manager.. when he returned he states that they couldn’t do the return because the item was missing. REALLY...In reply I told him how was it my fault that they sold me an empty box! At this point I knew that both the cashier and store manager were giving me the run around. WHAT A JOKE! I walked out of the store and called Best Buy Corporate office and stated the situation.. the young man on the phone tells me I’m absolutely right that I was within the 15 days and they should take care of the situation with the empty box. He asked me to go back in the store and he would speak to the store manager on my cell phone. As I returned I asked for the store manager and told him that customer service wanted to speak to him.. he then takes my phone walks away and speaks to the young man.. enough so I wouldn’t be able to hear the conversation. A few minutes later he gives me the phone and the young man tells me that they wouldn’t be able to do anything for me because it’s up to the store managers discretion. Are you kidding me! First they give me the run around, lack of training, lack of customer service for sure, scam artists and now I’m out over $50.00.. Thank you!",0,1

Best Buy,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service ever, the staff is very rude, once I took my computer, 20 days after the purchase was done and my extended guarantee and the customer service employee implied that I did something to my computer on purpose, without even checking it first, they took forever to fix it and said that their guarantee didn’t really made Bestbuy responsible, HP was the one to blame all the time, why do you pay extra for a BestBuy guarantee then? After more than two months of blaming HP, or blaming employees after employees, managers hiding because they pomised me an answer by certain date and they still didn’t know anything about my computer, I received my computer, and still had the same issue, even the person who gave it to me back was turning it on to show me that it was fine... it stopped functioning and took about 10 mins to re-boot....I told him that I didn’t want to take the computer like that, they said that they couldn’t send it back since they already send it and nothing changed, basically all refused to give me back my money, so I received a 100 dollars gift card for all the trouble. One week after I went back to spend my 100 dollars card only to find that it was only a 50 dollars card, nobody wanted to take responsibility or do something about it. I wrote a complain to their customer service email in 2017.... it’s 2018 and still waiting for an answer. DON’T EVER BUY THERE!!!!!",0,1

Best Buy,Abhorrent customer service / Geek Squad,"I purchased a laptop online around Christmas of 2016 if memory serves. I received the computer and turned it on and began going through all the hoops of setting it up. During this process it “crashed” showing a specific prompt on the screen later proved to mean the hard drive failed. It went back to Best Buy’s Geek Squad in Gainesville FL for service who replaced the hard drive. I then began the long process of setting it up again with the exact same failure with the same screen. Once again it was taken back to Best Buy and another hard drive installed... You guessed it. Back home, reinstall, later failure, same blue screen with the same information, and of course back to Best Buy yet again. This time with the promise of replacement if the issue returns. I returned home and made it all the way through the setup finally without a failure. I don’t use the computer all that often so it was a few months later than I needed it, turned it on, and go figure I was left staring at the same blue screen of death with the same information. Knowing with no shadow of a doubt what the problem was, yet a fourth time and two years later, I had a temporary loss of my faculties allowing hulk mode to come out smashing the screen... yes, dumb but it did make me feel better. This shattered a good portion of the screen however you could still see the outline and some of the words mentioned before indicating the failed hard drive. Back AGAIN to Best Buy thinking I’ll finally get rid of this lemon. No such luck. That is because they informed me that the warranty was no longer good as it’s past it’s 2 year mark. As I explained to the manager, Keith I believe, that the computer was in their possession for 3/4 of those 2 years with it essentially never working he advised me that there was nothing he could do. The classic “I understand you’re frustration but there’s nothing I can do” was essentially the continued response. So here I am now left with a broken laptop that never worked since day one, had been “fixed” three times before this incident, and now that they drug it out to its two year mark I’m now left with the bill. I highly discourage anyone from subjecting themselves to this abhorrent customer service as there are plenty of other places that will treat you with some form of respect. I still plan on trying to climb the corporate ladder to speak with someone at the regional level if possible to verify that this is how they wish to be perceived as a company. This was definitely one of the worst customer service interactions from such a large company of my nearly 40 year old life and I would personally be embarrassed and ashamed if it were my organization.",0,1

Best Buy,"Defective item, poor management, they’ll do anything to make a sale","They gave me a defective Mac. Sales person lied to me about what Geek Squad was able to do. He signed me up for a credit card but did not tell me until the entire transaction was over that I might be charged double my first months.. when I was blown away at that because 2x the payment is a difference of hundreds of dollars to owe, he said nothing and left. I called management and they were apathetic, the excuse being, “Salesmen don’t know credit card policies.” Then why equip them the ability to sell them to me? I then called customer service to inquire about what to do when I move across the country .. they were helpful, but when I inquired the following week about where to exchange the computer, I was given a sketchy response. In the second phone call, I never once mentioned I was moving across the country. All I did was say, “I picked my Mac up at a different location than where it was originally purchased. What is the policy on where I return it to?” I never mentioned moving across the country in this call and was referring to a different store location in my same town, however the representative says, “So if I understand your question correctly, you have moved back across the country and want to know where to return your computer?” My immediate question was how she knew I was moving across the country. She paused and told me in an unconvincing voice that I had just told her that. I insisted I did not, as I am referring to 2 locations within my town, and again asked how she knew that. Was it based on my phone number? She then attempted to dodge the question from thereon out, instead insisting on getting my email. I was finally like, “Look. I just want to know the policy on where to return.” and she finally told me “Any store” after a 5 minute runaround trying to collect my information, whereby she obviously had a file pulled up for my phone number that included information from a previous phone call that they are denying. My problem isn’t keeping a file on me, it’s 1) their terrible sales that care more about signing people up for credit exploitatively than actually doing their job, 2) waiting 30+ mins waiting to talk to the location’s sales team but on hold with no one answering, 3) sketchy customer service from the general Best Buy branch that care more about tracking your information without consent than providing me with information until I insist several times, 4) the fact they sold me a defective Mac with manipulative sales tactics and apathy from the manager. I was planning on exchanging for a new Mac, but after this experience, I will not be buying from them again and now I have their stupid credit card for no reason.",0,1

Best Buy,worst installation experience ever!,"The ordering from the store was fine, but it went downhill from there. I carefully measured the door opening to the basement after reviewing the measurements shown on the Best Buy website and the email sent to me urging me to get ready for the installation. When the delivery arrived, the delivery man looked at the door and said the opening was too small; when I told him I had measured it already, he said that the information Best Buy provides is incorrect, and he knew if because he frequently delivered this particular model and he had told management the information they provided customers was wrong. I then had to get an emergency carpenter come to tear out my door frame. They installed the dryer, but when they unwrapped the washer they told me that there was a huge dent in it, like it had been dropped from a forklift from a height; he said it was not worth the chance, even with a discount, that it was severely damaged, and not merely cosmetic; it wasn't a scratch. I refused it. They said they would reschedule the next day. They didn't. Then they rescheduled for a few days later. The problem was that they rescheduled an installation, but NOT a washer! So they were going to send someone to install a washer that they were not going to deliver! So, they rescheduled the whole thing for another day. They came that next day, but once again, the washer was damaged, with large scratches across the front, very visible. So, they had to come back yet again to install a third washer another day. Each time I had to be prepared to be there for 12 hours each day, until they told me the night before what window they wanted. Hard to schedule work when I could not know until the night before if I was coming in to work. After all this, I had to hire a carpenter to reconstruct the door frame and then a painter to do touch up of the new frame. Best Buy said it was my problem, not theirs. When I wrote to the CEO of the company, a man who admitted he had no power called me back, said I could not speak to anyone else, and when I demanded that they correct the misinformation they provide, he refused, saying they had no control over the website information. Overall, Best Buy was truly incompetent in this purchase installation, and provided misinformation that they should have known by now was inaccurate, and led to significant costs for me, which they refused to reimburse. Avoid Best Buy for any appliance purchases!",0,1
Best Buy,"Beware of So Called Sale Prices at ""Best Buy""!","I purchased an Asus Laptop 3 years ago along with tech support, add ons etc. I was unpleasantly surprised when it refused to turn on & I brought it to the Geeks at Best Buy as I normally would. I was then told "" it was the Mother Board & a new one would cost less than fixing this one""! When I mentioned it was only 3 years old ( actually 1 month shy ) I was told rather casually that "" when you purchase a unit like that, it's about all you can expect! "". Excuse me? It was $485 on sale & almost $ 1 K after all the other stuff they unload on you. I am a 79 y.o. senior & expected at least 5 years . I spent what I could afford for everyday use. I guess I didn't spend enough for a high end unit. It was a Worst Buy for me, never again!",0,2

Best Buy,"Beware of Best Buy's ""You Can Return It"" Claim","Best BuyBest Buy 2018-07-12 1/5Beware of Best Buy's ""You Can Return It"" Claim“After spending $789 on a Samsung Galaxy S9 phone, plus $45 on the case and $31 on the glass cover, plus the $11 per month for the damage and loss/theft protection plans, I also asked the sales person about “stands” for the back of it – I case I would ever want to set it on a tray table on a flight and watch a video or whatever. He showed me some “pop-sockets” for $15 each. I said I wasn’t sure if I would want to put it on the phone, but would buy one and think about it. He indicated I could return it within 14 days as long as I had the packaging and receipt.Two days later, I decided the $15 pop-socket wasn’t going to be something I would use, and brought it back to the same Best Buy. I was able to return it, but in the course of the transaction a second receipt generated saying “Warning, future returns might be declined.” I asked what that meant and the customer service person she did not know. There was info on that receipt about contacting ""The Retail Equation"" to get more information on our return activity. In any returns we have made to large retailers - Target, Home Depot, Lowe's etc. - we have always made the return within the acceptable return period, always with a receipt, and have never been issued a ""warning"" or been denied a return. So I didn't think much more about it, thought it was possibly a fluke or that Best Buy was doing this to deter people from returning things too often or without a receipt.Fast forward to a week or so later when my husband called to tell me that Best Buy refused to allow his return of a $120 wireless TV device. At the time of his purchase, he was also assured by the salesperson that he could return the item within 14 days, as long as he had the receipt. He had not removed the device from the package, had his receipt, and attempted the return within the 14-day period. He was told by the customer service person that there was nothing Best Buy could do about the denied return and that he would need to contact ""The Retail Equation"" - the vendor Best Buy had hired to monitor fraudulent returns, returns without receipts, etc. As we were following Best Buy's return policy to a ""T"", yet were denied the credit, we have disputed the charge with our credit card company and hope to have it resolved that way. We are also considering sharing our story with a major law firm who is collecting peoples' experience with The Retail Equation in consideration of a possible class action.Thanks for nothing, Best Buy. Apparently my $900.00-plus phone purchase, along with thousands of dollars of TVs, laptops, electronic accessories and gift cards we've purchased over the past 20 years, count for nothing. Bye-bye, Best Buy. We won't be shopping there again and look forward to patronizing retailers where the ""You Can Return It"" claim actually means something.",0,1
Best Buy,Worst customer service ever,"Best Buy seems to specialize in customer DISservice. Ordered a tv online, received a sharp 50"" with a completely shattered screen. When I contacted them about returning/replacing the damaged tv I ended up spending 2.5 hours on the phone with seven different people. They completely bungled the entire transaction, forgetting to submit an order for a replacement, sending bad instructions to UPS, and finally just completely failing to pick up the broken tv. Eventually I gave up and recruited a couple people to help me drag the busted tv to a UPS store. This entire experience was a disaster from start to finish that could have been completely avoided if Best Buy actually hired and trained even moderately functional customer service representatives. Not one of the seven associates I communicated with had a clue regarding how to process a return/replacement for a damaged online order. Worse than that, six of the seven spoke such broken, poor English that is quite evident that the bulk of the difficulty with this absurd transaction was the result of an inability to communicate properly and a total lack of training.",0,1
Best Buy,Extremely frustrated and disappointed,"The service at the store was acceptable. We purchased a washer and dryer. Despite the fact that we wondered around for a while before someone offered assistance. The day of the delivery geek squad damaged my garage door. They left me with the door half way open and hanging from one side. I am extremely disappointed on how my claim was handled. The gentleman that came admitted to have damaged the door they told me ""we can't fix it and we have other deliveries to complete"". After calling numerous times and getting the run around by different people my claim was denied due to lack of evidence on my part. This was a very frustrating situation for me to deal with and after reviewing several complaints, the company is not being held accountable to any damages caused to properties.",0,1

Best Buy,Honest Question: How is this company still in business?,"I haven't shopped in Best Buy for several years, and now I know why. I went there to purchase four Pixel 2 phones. This review isn't so much about my experience activating those phones, it's about my interaction with customer service after the purchase. After 3 days, the phones dropped another $100 in price. I reached out to customer service for Best Buy's price guarantee, with disappointing results. The agent attempted to point me to various part of the policy as to why they were denying the price match, but none of them made sense. When I asked for clarification, they kept pointing me to the general policy and wouldn't address my specific concerns. Ultimately, the agent became combatitive and cut me off. Best Buy could really benefit from focusing on ways to improve the overall customer experience.Sadly, based on all of these negative reviews I'm seeing, it doesn't seem like they care. Also, I feel like Best Buy isn't really in the position to driving away customers, especially ones that are willing to give them a second chance. Honestly, I would have really rather posted a super positive experience with this company and my interaction on the customer service side of things...if only they would give me a reason to.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy has Stolen $6000 of my money,"i purchased 3 large alarm systems and cameras from best buy and also paid for their installation, they stay at my home until midnight just working on the first installation and could not get the system to work, so we cancelled everything and removal and they didnt even attempt to install the other 2 systems, its been 6 weeks and they have not returned my $6000 and they keep saying oh yes its been refunded and it never has, i have rung their head office management team and they said they would look into it and get back to me and they never have even though i have rung back their several times and left messages, i have been to the branch many many times, and the person whom sold me the system no longer works there and texted me saying that the company has issues and are no longer allowed to sell those security systems as the manufacturer has pulled out of dealing with best buy, my house has holes in it and has been damaged from this installation and what makes it worse is that we had a perfectly good working system in the house before we just wanted to upgrade and now we have no protection at all and we are out $6000 dollars as well.",0,1
Best Buy,"SCAMMED out of $300 in store, then kicked out.","I was considering getting a gopro from Amazon because it's much cheaper, but I figured I'd go to Best Buy to support them, since it comes in handy to have them around for when a card fails and I need one right away.I went to this one on my way to work not long before they closed, got a gopro, and opened it in my car. The battery was missing for the gopro. So I went inside to ask if I needed to buy it separately. They said it comes with one. I told them mine didn't. So they got a replacement and had me go to customer service to get it exchanged.I had chosen an e-mailed receipt, so I didn't have a receipt for the associate. I swiped my card for them, the card I used for the transaction. He didn't even look, and said it didn't come up. He asked me for my phone number, so I gave it to him. He didn't even enter it, and said nothing came up. He then accused me of intentionally damaging the camera and showed me the lens easily popped off. I told him that's strange, because I just pulled it out of the package. Then he said the camera's serial number didn't match the one on the box, and accused me of having stolen the packaging in order to exchange a broken one for a new one.I assured him I hadn't stolen it, and asked if he really couldn't find anything. He said their system isn't fast, so a transaction from 10 minutes prior wouldn't show up anyway. He continued accusing me of being a thief and trying to pull one over on him. I asked if we could speak with Tahnee, the associate who sold me the gopro. He said we wouldn't speak with anyone, and continued accusing me of heinous acts. He became extremely hostile and kicked me out of the store and told me to have a good day.So, here I am with a broken gopro without a battery that I paid $300 for, trying to support a business rather than just going to Amazon. Never again. I am disgusted and furious with how I, as a long-time customer, was treated here. $300 is a lot of money to me. I wrestled with spending that much on a camera for over a year.Also, I chose to have an e-mailed receipt. I was never sent one, and the associate blamed it all on me.",0,1
Best Buy,BEWARE OF BEST BUY ON EBAY,"BEWARE OF BEST BUY ON EBAYI purchased a laptop on Ebay from Best Buy for $599, later that day Best Buy requested to cancel my order giving no reason and issued a refund on Paypal.I declined the request to cancel and got an email with a ""pay now"" button to pay for the item again, I did so.Then got no shipping info from Best Buy, so I contacted them trhough Ebay message - Their response was ""we have no record of your order in our system"".After multiple messages to them containing the Best Buy order number, Ebay item number, Paypal Transaction ID complete with date and time stamps, their response is the same ""we have no record of your order in our system"".So I am left to pursue a refund through a Paypal claim against them, until it is resolved my money is tied up with Best Buy.I have spent lots of time trying to get this resolved with no results as of yet, I can only hope that Paypal gets my money returned to me, because Best Buy does not care.

Best Buy,Best Buy started to get things right…,"Best Buy started to get things right and then decided to fail...miserably. I have had a few bad experiences with orders and then was greeted in a store by an associates music behind the counter -- ""F"" this, ""suck blank blank"", etc. I also witnessed an associate actually begin yelling at a customer when the customer was being rational and never raised his voice. Great service.But the straw that broke this camels back was their inability to deliver an order two times - that same order. I placed an order that went to UPS, was then given to USPS and then lost. I called to get a replacement and was assured that it would arrive by June 12. Again, no package. I checked the tracking and found that two days ago the package was less than 100 miles away in Philly - I live in NYC. That is a 1.5 hour drive. For two days now it has been ""in route to next location"".The real problem is that there is no way to contact customer service other than IM and phone -- ie email. I want an actual paper trail so that I have a record of the conversation when I need it, but they no longer allow emails. I want to be able to prove the conversations that I have, what we discussed and when I had them. Call me old fashioned, I don't care. Call me a satisfied Best Buy customer and my blood will boil.Go to Amazon. Their service is not great but at least they take care of the messes they make.",0,1
Best Buy,Very bad shopping experience,"I need a laptop for an international trip. Before the travel day, I decide to buy one from bestbuy.com and pick it up in store. I bought a Best Buy gift card from an online app. Then I placed the order and redeemed the gift card successfully at bestbuy.com. But some time later, they cancelled my order by e-mail without any reasons specified. I tried to call their customer service number and was told that I need to wait for 60 minutes. Then I tried to chat with their online agent and was told the order was cancelled because no credit card was entered when I placed the order. Yes, they need a credit a card number even if the gift card balance is enough to cover the whole order. This is OK, but the problem is that they didn't ask you to enter the credit card at all when you place the order and they let the order go through successfully!!! What a stupid design! Even worse, when I told the agent that I needed the laptop urgently and how I could get the order approved, the agent didn't have the desire to help me resolve the issue at all. It's just a waste of time to talk with them! I understand if I had same issue with Amazon, I would definitely get a different answer. Best Buy, you still have a long way to go to win the war!",0,1

Best Buy,Dishwasher,"We purchased a dishwasher, paid in full on 5/28 and then were informed it would take 8 days for delivery. Seemed excessive, but didn’t want to start the process over at another store. Day of delivery, one installer arrived and didn’t adequately have the unit supported on his dolly. It consequently fell off and was damaged. He assured me Best Buy would call me the next day. No call, no call the following day so I called the store, they were unable to help me. They gave my number to someone in the company who could help with the situation...only she really couldn’t because there was no paperwork. Jennifer assured me she would call me back later that afternoon when she had the information she needed. No call, I called again this morning and was informed the first available date for the dishwasher to be delivered is in another 7 days. 19 days after we purchased the unit. I wish we had cancelled our order on 5/28 and gone to Lowes as we originally had intended to do. Won’t be shopping Best Buy again anytime soon!",0,1

Best Buy,Failure to complete installation or remove packaging.,"I bought a new dryer from bb. The purchase included the unit, installation, removal of the packaging and removing the old unit. They arrived with the new unit but claimed it would not fit through the door of the washing room or up the stairs so they could not install it. So I removed the old unit and installed the new one myself. Then I called them to pick up the old unit and the packaging for the new unit. They came to collect the old unit and left the packaging for the new unit behind ... even though I asked them while they were here. So I spent an hour with customer service being transferred multiple times. They finally said they would not remove the packaging as that service was included with the installation that they were not able to do!! It would have been easy to leave a largely satisfied customer by simply taking the packaging while they were here and/or informing me of their policy at the time they left the unit. It does not serve them well to treat a customer this way.",0,1

When I got home the Go Pro was damaged, and I need another memory card for it to work. Immediately I went back 30 min. Later to have it exchanged and buy the additional memory card. It was return and was purchased again but as a new sale. The Go Pro was not to my expectations I was not satisfied. I paid 800.00 plus two memory card and a extra battery. Since I was not satisfied, I went back for a return. They said, that I had too many returns ( not true, returns but with an upgrade) even thought I had my receipt. That they would allowed me to return only one purchase. I had two purchase because the extra battery and memory card was purchased when I first bought the pro cam that I returned because it was defective. The second receipt was for the pro cam exchange and the extra memory card. Lucky I was able to return the 800.00 pro cam with one of the memory card. But they refuse to return the extra battery 50.00 I purchase that was never open and seal including the memory card 45.00. They said I have to many returns.

Best Buy,Terrible Appliance Buying Experience,"I bought a new wash machine and dryer for my new house online with Bestbuy and scheduled installation service. Even before the initial delivery and installation happened, I had at least 3 conversations with their customer service department regarding the parts I needed for installation and the appointment time. But when the installation guys came, they said that I did not buy a separate stacking kit and they would have to reschedule my installation.Fine, it was my bad for not knowing that was a separate purchase after buying 3-4 difference accessories for the installation. So I called in and made the purchase. The woman on the phone said that she would reschedule my installation with the delivery of the kit. 3 days later I still got no confirmation for the installation, only a delivery notice for the stacking kit. So I called in again. To my surprise they canceled the installation services that I already paid for and did not reschedule at all.Well everybody makes mistakes, I assumed. And I asked them to schedule my installation. They happily obliged. And a couple days later the installation turned out to be for the wash machine only! They can't install the gas dryer without me paying for a separate installation! Fine, I would do it just to get them installed. A few more days later, the installation guys came (4 hours before the actual window scheduled). They were not happy that I did not take off work to accommodate their time. But they tried to install both machines. Just as I thought it would finally be done, they told me that the stacking kit was missing a part. So these guys left without installing them. I called in asking about the stacking kit, and was told that the best way was to go into the store near me and replace it. Being patient again, I went to the store that claimed to have the part. After waiting for another 2 hours at the store, the employee there told me that they could not find the stacking kit in stock and I will have to purchase another one, have it delivered, and return the original kit. I said okay, please reschedule the installation to be on the same day.Another 4 days later, I got a call from the installation team, saying that they were at my door, waiting for me and if I did not be there in 15 minutes, they would leave. I was so surprised because it just reached the window but their policy was to call me 30 minutes before they get there. I said I could not be there until 20 minutes later. They guy said, without any emotion, we will have to reschedule your installation. Calling Best Buy was a dismay at this point. I could not get a better answer than that they would call me on the next day for a reschedule.There I am, 3 weeks after the initial delivery, having talked to numerous rude customer service agents on the phone , taking off time from work a few times, and 5 reschedules later, still do not have the wash machine and dryer installed.This purchase experience is such a joke that I would not recommend anyone buying anything important from them.At ConsumerAffairs we love to hear from both consumers and brands; please never hesitate to Contact Us.At ConsumerAffairs we take privacy seriously, please refer to our Privacy Policy to learn more about how we keep you protected.You’re responsible for yourself and please remember that your use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use.Advertisements on this site are placed and controlled by outside advertising networks.

Best Buy,Geek Squad repairs only last until the warranty is over,"I purchased a computer with the extended warranty for my daughter. I took it in right before the warranty expired, they were to have replaced the keyboard and motherboard. I get it back and my daughter can tell a difference immediately, and not in a good way.

I asked the 3 lazy employees sitting in appliances for assistance the girl was too busy talking about her personal life to bat an eye to help me. one guy with a seemed disability tried but didn't understand the name and came back with wrong information. I also at one point heard on a loud yell from someone far away thought it was a customer acting like a savage when it was an employee i guess disgusting a night out and acting up in cheer. SMH. then 15 minutes to check out using a gift card manager sal and employee didn't enter serial number right. lousy $15 card I asked sal he couldn't just deduct it? he said no. so i have to waste my time not getting paid while they're getting paid for incompetent employee and manager? it is wrong and no wonder closing stores as i surely will not shop at. I believe terrible employees including manager sal. smh why I hardly shop best buy keep treating customers like that and see if around years from now. looking up best buy corporate phone number and see so many negative reviews besides looking up best buy reviews wow no surprise guess its not just me. I can't believe ALL the unprofessionalism which is obviously FAILED MANAGEMENT. I spoke to sarah at corporate and Jude assistance store manager totally useless waste of time",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy Rewards Program SCAM - Buyer Beware,"I spent an hour dealing with Best Buy (NO) rewards program customer service and got NO satisfaction. My husband and I have spent over $4000 since the end of November 2017-Early March 2018 on different appliances (Cooktop, Dishwasher, Dryer and several smaller items). When we went to find out why we didn't have more reward points to use for future items, the wonderful associates at the Perimeter Store in GA were unable to answer us so they gave us the reward center's number and all past receipts. When I called I got a woman on the phone that told me I wasn't getting any points since I used the Best Buy credit card and I had 18 months interest free unless I paid it all in the first 30 days. I told her I didn't understand that as a company policy because I spent my money there and the reward would have come to about $40. Yet it would have been worth it for the company for a mere $40 to reward their customers for buying from them, especially with so many choices of places to buy the exact same item from! She didn't care at all so I asked for a supervisor, to which she immediately replied, ""No!"" I told her I just wanted someone to know that I think it is a very poor company policy overall. She said ""please hold"" and hung up! So, I called back and asked for a supervisor to whom I could express disappointment about a company policy. I was told, by a woman who said her name was Daria, only if I gave her all my information would she transfer me to a supervisor. I then called the corporate office and told the person who directs your call, what had just happened, why I was frustrated and that I wanted to speak to a person in corporate who would at least hear my disappointment, whether or not they could do anything. I was asked to hold on and then I got sent back to the Rewards department! I asked for a supervisor, the woman, Maria, claimed to be one, told me there is nothing to be done and that's the way it is. I said I understand that yet I wanted to make it known that I was very unhappy. I told her my husband is a military veteran and we can buy from Home Depot or Lowes the exact same items with a 10% discount which is even more savings than their rewards. I could even use another 0% financing credit card! The reason we go to the Best Buy Perimeter is because of the associates there. They are helpful and excellent and we feel a loyalty to them. We even had a bad experience with the Alpharetta Best Buy but never bad at the Perimeter store. The people make the difference. Even with that, the rewards department and maybe corporate's unwillingness to have any empathy or understanding towards my frustration and feeling cheated is unacceptable. It might be time to get my upscale appliances at a store that cares!",0,1
Best Buy,I have had one of the worst experiences…,"I have had one of the worst experiences in dealing with any company ever! We purchased a security system. It didn't work from the start and I spent many hours on the phone trying to get it fixed. Talked to many, many people. Finally, John from install (3rd party)who originally installed it was supposed to come out from 8-12 on Friday. He never showed...again, despite getting confirmations day before from Best Buy. This is after a month of frustration and this was our last attempt. I think most of the problem was with the 3rd party installation company that they contract with Best Buy. It was a terrible experience. Best Buy and Install does not communicate....and install is the worst! We are requesting our money back! Horrible experience!",0,1

Their price match is a joke even though they heavily advertise they won't be beat on price. Read the price match policy sometime, they only match with 6 other stores that have the same high prices as them. And yes, they are among the highest priced retailers on most products. They also have very rude, lazy, and incompetent personnel in their stores.",0,1
Best Buy,This company is a joke!,"This company is a joke!! Ok it's started off with me buying the S9+ as a birthday gift to myself on 3/19/18 My friend found out I bought the phone so he bought me a case Well, I liked the case ( leather wallet type) but it wasn't fitting my needs. So I went to best buy to return it they said ""with no receipt no exchange or return "" all I wanted to do was exchange but this company is stupid so i asked for the manager he comes around the corner ready to shake my hand an take care of my needs...oh wait I still have no receipt, so he begins to try an make me feel stupid by saying ""there's nothing wrong with this case"" I explained ""that is correct but it doesn't fit my needs. One issue is there is no cut out on the front of the leather case so you can hear clearly"". He said "" you don't close it, it will cut the phone off if you do""...I was over him by then I asked for his bosses # Mike Duvall 757 493 9232 he explained you can call him tomorrow. I said ""I'm not here tomorrow I'm here now"" so he gave me customer support which I called an talked to a number of ppl but kepted asking for their boss because this rule is fuc$king stupid an I talked to one lady who asked for my friends phone number so she could call an verify that he did indeed purchase this case( ADD BAD LANGUAGE HERE)!!! ""So let me get this straight BEST BUY you don't believe someone who takes the timein the reason to come to your store but your gonna believe a guy who is my friend an you just talk to onthe phone? This company is acting like Nazi's. Your gonna bother my friends for what? So, I know this review won't change anyone's mind but the ppl I know an the ppl my friend knows on where not to shop.

The next day with in 1 minute of two of the items in this order being delivered, they sent an email & said the delivery date would have to be changed with no explanation. Best Buy has taken this approach since they hit a lull, they will advertise availability & once the order has been billed or partially delivered they change the delivery to fit their needs, or they don't have availability & tell you that they do so you will place the order. Sad state of affairs for what used to be a decent company! I will never make another purchase of any kind from Best Buy!

Best Buy,Someone stole my item....,"Now that I have received my replacement dvd I'm done with Best Buy. I ordered a dvd and when it arrived in the mail the shrink wrap was torn open and the dvd was missing. Whoever worked in the Best Buy Distribution Center in Louisville, Kentucky stole my dvd. Seriously you have to be really cold hearted to rip open the shrink wrap, steal the dvd & then mail off an empty case. I called the Best Buy customer service and the woman said that she can replace my dvd but that I had to take the empty dvd box back up to the Best Buy store or the company will double charge my credit card if I didn't. I drove all the way out to the Best Buy store only to find out that what the customer service woman did was wrong. The best buy manager said the woman wasn't supposed to order me another one through the mail. I was just supposed to return the empty box and pick up the same dvd at any store. I waited 4 days to receive my replacement dvd, I'm glad that this time the dvd wasn't stolen. I choose not to order from Best Buy anymore because whoever works in the factory is not trust worthy. Who knows what else he/she has stolen from other customers?",0,1

Best Buy,Free My TV!,"I placed a TV order on March 3rd. The earliest delivery was March 9th so I chose it. That morning the guys from the geek squad showed up with my TV to install it. Once they put it up on the mount they discovered a great big impact hole at the top of the TV. Obviously this wasn’t gonna work so they took it back and told me to call the store. So I called the store near me at 1560 W Kroger Center Blvd in Richmond, VA. I spoke with Travis and explained what happened. He couldn’t get the TV to me until the 14th. That didn’t work for me. I offered to pay more for another TV, but the ONLY thing he could do for me was schedule the appointment for the 14th and told me they’d call me within 4 hours. That time passed and no one called so I went to the store where I waited at customer service for “Travis” who was on the phone. After 30 minutes another lady started working on my problem. To her credit, she actually tried to help. She called directly to get delivery dates and tried options with different TVs. Finally I offered to have install removed and just requested delivery. They found a TV in stock for a similar price and could deliver it on the 11th. Fine. I can work with that. BUT then I find out that I would have to have the first order refunded and then repurchase. We both know that refund isn’t going to process for at least 3 days and I don’t have an extra $1200 just laying around for the new TV. So that’s no longer an option. I asked the young lady to just refund my purchase. She did, but I received no email to confirm and she couldn’t print it. The only option was to take a screen shot of the refund with my phone. Okay.This is the worst I’ve ever been treated as a consumer. I’m trying to support your business and give you money and this is how I’m treated? I’ve worked in customer service for over a decade. If this were my business and I did this to you, I’d have upgraded your TV and delivered it with my own truck if I had to. Or I would have at least given you options to make you happy and give you what you want and paid for. Abysmal.By the time I got home I had calmed down. I still needed a new TV so I started looking online. On the Best Buy website I found the exact same TV as my original purchase for a cheaper price AND it could be delivered on the 11th. I put it on my credit card and confirmed the delivery date. I signed up for text messaging for updates. Deliver is set for tomorrow and I haven’t received any texts or emails since my original confirmation. So I checked online. I log in and it asks me to RESCHEDULE MY APPOINTMENT! The earliest date is now the 15th. Umm no, I already confirmed the 11th. So I call Best Buy customer service. The lady tells me that the TV is not in stock and they won’t have it until that day. Then why is it listed available on the website!? Why am I able to select an install date for the 11th!? You got me again, Best Buy. You have over $2000 of my money and I still dont have a TV.To reiterate, this is the absolute worst customer experience I have ever had. I promise this is the last time I give my money to Best Buy. I also promise to post this on as many review websites as I can find!",0,1
Best Buy,NEVER SHOP @ Best Buy !,"Last year ,I bought a cell phone from best buy.I ordered it online and picked it up from the store. I took it home ,called my provider to activate the phone ,they said the phone could not be activated because some numbers on the phone had to activated at the store,I took the ph back to best buy the salesman fiddled with the phone and said ok it's good to go now. Before I left the store ,my nephew again tried to activate the phone ,still could not be activated.I asked to speak to a manager @ Best Buy ,explained what happened ,he called the salesman over and asked him (as if he didn't believe me!) The manager ended up speaking with my provider ,they worked with the phone for over an hour ,the store closed ,they were still going back and forth.There was only 1 phone in the store. Finally I told them just give me my money back! I think they knew there was a problem with the phone ,they tried to get me to purchase another phone ,I told them I did not want to do business with Best Buy again! I will NEVER shop @ Best Buy again! This is not the first time I've had problems with Best Buy. Once I went in to buy at tv that was advertised,I went in the first day of the sale ,I was told they didn't have any of the tvs that were on sale but they had a ""comparable tv""that was over $100.00 more than the sale price. I walked out of the store.",0,1
Best Buy,Would not recommend buying appliances…,"Would not recommend buying appliances here:Did a full kitchen remodel and purchased all of our appliances from this Best Buy (Northglenn - Colorado). To say the experience was less than wonderful would be an understatement.Cliff notes:RANGE: Spent ~$12K in total for all appliances in Sept '16. I didn't need appliances until December but was assured by sales person to order at that time to take advantage of Labor Day sales and they would deliver later. 1st mistake - I trusted him and made purchase.Fast forward to December. Receive all appliances. Wrong range delivered (gas only, not dual fuel as purchased). No big deal, mistakes happen. Call Best Buy to get it replaced and I'm told they discontinued that model so nothing they could do. Called around, found one at a competitors and reordered (same cost + I got a 5yr warranty vs. 1yr). Scheduled Best Buy to pick up range. They didn't come. Range on front porch (of Downtown Denver home). They couldn't come get it for another ~2 weeks. Corporate called me to apologize and try to escalate pick up. Didn't make that happen and said I'd be liable if anything happened to range (tough to move by myself...) Terrible experience. No resolution. Nothing offered by Best Buy to recompense.FRIDGE:Purchased fridge. Installed. Didn't work. Called Best Buy for repair, they told me they couldn't work on this model and I'd have to go to mfgr. Fast Forward 5 repair trips later and it works... I had asked for them to replace the fridge with a new one and guess what.....they told me they couldn't because it too had been discontinued.Going to back to what I was originally told by Best Buy sales person: ""There won't be any issues ordering now and having delivered in Dec."" My last conversation with Best Buy corporate rep was something along the lines of 'this has left a pretty bad taste in my mouth and I can't imagine I'll be shopping here again or recommend to anyone' The response I got was, ""That's your prerogative"".Bottom line: Don't be fooled. They'll sell but the backend service and support doesn't warrant buying big ticket items.",0,1

About 1.5 hours later, I get an email saying one card didn't work, then I get a second email saying only one card worked on the second order. That's when I realized I had 2 order no number. I tried to fix it online but there was no option to run the gift card again so I went to the store. The rep in the store ended up calling their hotline and that rep tells me I have to wait 24 hours to let the balance go back on the card. I asked him why can't they fix it while I'm in the store now and he kept repeating the same stuff to me over and over, then he gave me the silent treatment before I started asking him why is he not helping me. He then told me I should just use my credit card to pay the balance. I laughed at him and told him after this experience I don't want to spend this money with this company at all. I told the store rep Terrence what was said. He gave me my cards back and once again I left out of Best Buy an unhappy customer.

Best Buy,Awful extended warranty service on washer,"I purchased a washing machine 2 years ago from Best Buy with a 4 year extended warranty. The machine stopped working two weeks ago. I have been trying to schedule a repair appointment ever since. Even though my agreement is with Geek Squad, thanks to fine print, Best Buy, through AIG which is a third party provider, outsources their service to A&E , which is a branch of Sears, a competitor to Best Buy. For about 2 weeks now, I have been trying to make an appointment. Despite talking to 5 Geek squad representatives, 3 customer service representative and 5 different supervisors at AIG, 3 different employees (1 supervisor and 2 customer service representatives) at A&E and 2 customer service representatives at Sears, and making the same appointment 5 times, I kept on receiving phone calls and emails from Sears to reschedule my appointment saying they can't get anyone on the five times confirmed date and time. I literally spent over 4 hours on the phone in the last 10 days with these people, confirming the same appointment only to receive a call three hours later each time to reschedule that just confirmed appointment. Now they are telling me the earliest appointment they can give me is three weeks ahead since I can't accommodate their preferred date and time. The last supervisor at AIG told me that the companies where Best Buy is outsourcing from will only give them a limited number of appointments and hold other appointments for paying customers despite the fact that we have obviously paid for these services in advance when we purchased the warranty. When I called Best Buy back to complain about their third party provider and asked to talk to a supervisor, after waiting 15 minutes on the phone, I was informed that they won't talk to me because it is not their policy to take complaints over the phone about warranty and repair issues. I had been a loyal client to Best Buy for over 10 years now and bought merchandise worth thousands of dollars. I will never buy anything from Best Buy again.

Monday morning credit card company calls and asks if this was a purchase I was trying to make, I say yes, they tell me they will authorize the payment, so I go back and try it again, I get by the 1st appointment and the 2nd appointment pops up the same message!!! at about the same time my home phone rings and goes to the machine, I hear an automated voice from Best Buy wanting to schedule a delivery??? A delivery for what?? email pops up from the card company showing me that a large purchase has just been authorized, so I go back to the web site and see that only one item is going to be delivered and there are issues with the other items, I call the number from the message, says this number has changed, press ""1"" to have a chance at getting $100 in store rebate?? I do nothing and I swear the next automated voice says ""did you hear what I said?"" LOL I hang up I call the number on the website, Finally someone speaking good english, I ask ""what the hell is going on?"" the guy calms me down sets the delivery date. so now we wait to see how that goes. The one item did arrive, so strange. I have to say that ever since Circuit City and HH Gregg have closed up, Best Buy has had no real competition to keep them on their toes for customers. Maybe it was partly the credit card company's attempt to protect me, but I have used this card with MANY other online orders and never had this issue, so my thought is that whatever system Best Buy uses is not trusted by banks that issue the cards. So get a trusted processing system!",0,3
Best Buy,Awful! Worst experience ever! Useless customer service!,"Awful!!! Incredibly unprofessional! Ordered a Boost SIM card for store pick up on December 3. They tell me to wait 4 days until it's available at the store. Fine. When the day for pickup arrives, they send me an email that the item has been delayed and I have to reschedule. So I ask them to send it to my place by mail. They said it will arrive by December 12. When the day comes, I get another email that the item has been delayed AGAIN. The item has been delayed TWICE. And they tell me that ""it will arrive by December 27"" (that is, almost a month after I paid for it). I get in contact with their customer serice to ask for an explanation and a solution to this, they tell me to keep waiting. What the hell? I want my money back!! This is unnaceptable!Not only that, but I had to spend 45 minutes on their chat because their representatives are so useless! I first asked them to find me a different store where the item was available for pickup today. They were unable to do that, because ""they couldn't change the status of my order"". Then I asked them to cancel my order and give me my money back. They told me they can't do that either, and offered me ""the alternative"" of reordering the item and when the first one arrived, canceling the second one and getting my money back for the second. Absolutely ridiculous!! If you can't cancel the first order, why would you be able to cancel the second? Told them to not do anything at all, and I will go to a Boost store and get a SIM from them, which is what I should have done in the first place. I'm not giving one more cent to Best Buy. Enjoy the $10 you stole from me!Absolutely ridiculous!! DO NOT RECOMMEND. Will never buy at Best Buy again in my life. Stay away!!!!",0,1

Delivery men were not trained and were not unable to even get the dryer onto the front porch, so they had to turn around and cancel the delivery. When I called to reschedule, I spent 2 hours on the phone getting transferred from Best Buy to the Geek Squad to store locations, and back around. I called yesterday and was confirmed for a delivery next week, which has somehow disappeared on their end. I called today to confirm and they said they had no record of it. Now delivery is scheduled for over two weeks from now, so who knows if I will even get it. Never again.",0,1

I purchased an expensive ipad and ipencil on cyber monday at a discounted price and because of security issues, my bank put a hold until they could reach to validate the credit card charge. We told our bank it was acceptable but Best Buy went ahead and canceled my order. I called back and found myself in a long wait time (58 minutes) and then again later for 40 minutes. I finally got through to them in the evening after waiting 15 more minutes and told them what happened. The customer service department told me there was nothing that they could do and didn't have authorization to re-enable the order or to order the product for me. They offered to transfer me to another department but when i got into that queue, i was told that their offices were closed. So I am back at square one! very frustrating.

Best Buy,One day at Best Buy...,"One day, I decided that I would buy an All-in-One touchscreen computer because I thought it had been a good while since my last computer and I needed something a little bit more powerful (the computer is another story, by the way), so I thought, I'll buy from Best Buy. They normally have good deals, I can ask people working there about the computer, etc. I mean, that last part was a lie--I'm incredibly unsociable, so I decided to order it from the website. I figured it was easier, when it's time, I go pick it up, etc. I order the computer wait a few days and I get confirmation that I can pick it up. Great. Fantastic! I was ecstatic of course. New computer coming home and I can use it for more powerful things like stream Game of Thrones on HBO Go (rewatching is always fun). But then, I get there, and it was all nice and dandy. I receive my item after waiting for a long while. And I don't mind waiting. I will smile and nod while an old lady takes out her album of coupons for her ten or less items. I do not mind. I do not like to inconvenience anyone with my impatience. So waiting is not a problem. However, the exchange between the employee and I was curt. I don't mind directness, but it felt like I was inconveniencing him by picking up my package. Inside, I think, ""oh no, have I inconvenienced this man?"" But I remain positive, so I just grinned and bear it. When he hands me this package, which is HUGE by the way (which is small to some people--I am under 5 feet, mind you) and just gives me a nod. A ""yes, our exchange is over. Good day to you madam."" To which I give a ""and to you dear sir,"" nod. He leaves the counter and I realize I have no way of mobilizing this large, heavy box. I think, well, I need a cart. So I call over an employee and ask if I could leave it there while I get a cart. He says yes, and because I hate to inconvenience the staff, I quickly grab a cart and wheel it over. As soon as he sees me, the man leaves. And again, I am left alone with the dilemma of carrying this large, heavy box into the cart. But I am strong--in public--because I hate to inconvenience others, and transform into my bodybuilder self to carry the large, heavy box and plop it down into the cart with no trouble at all. Didn't even break a sweat. I leave the store, showing them my receipt before exiting of course, and faced the same dilemma when I reached my car. Thankfully, I am still in public and therefore can exhibit bouts of strength and put that large, heavy box in my car! Overall, great deals, terrible service!Cheers!",0,3

Our latest bad Best Buy experience was purchasing a $1400 camera that came with a defective battery. After bringing it to the truly incompetent ""Geek Squad"" one employee stated that entire camera had to be sent out to replace the battery (What?) and then another said, no that was incorrect - they won't cover the defective battery they sold us. The latter employee, a supervisor, said we should ask Cannon to give us a new battery so that the $1400 camera we bought from Best Buy would work.

Best Buy,This review relates to my experience …,"This review relates to my experience with the Geek Squad. I recently returned a computer which I had purchased at Best Buys in 2015 for repair. I was unable to recharge the HP computer. The first agent told me that the problem was the battery which I would have to purchase separately and would cost approx. $45.00. When I found the battery it was $125.00. When I returned with the battery, I was told by another agent that it was not the battery, but rather the plug fitting inside the computer and that it would be a costly repair. I would best consider buying a new computer. After receiving several other opinions, I learned that the mother board had been damaged by an electrical surge and that the problem had nothing to do with either the battery or the plug. I also had to travel to BB 6 times during the assessment only to find out that the ""technicians"" were completely wrong and recommended that I purchase a battery which I do no need. I wish to cancel my membership in the Geek Squad, but to do that is an impossible task. No where can I find online where one would be able to cancel membership.

Best Buy,Charged for subscription service without my permission or knowledge at Best Buy,"I will preface this review by saying the star rating of my review would have been much lower if not for the actions of the excellent staff members Darren and John at the Winnipeg Best Buy location on Pembina Highway. I bought an Asus laptop from Best Buy's location in Waterloo, Ontario. The laptop they initially gave me was defective with a failing hard drive. I took it back to them the next day. They offered me their customized setup service from Geek Squad, which I refused as I am a computer scientist by profession, but they explained that they wanted to be sure they weren't giving me another defective product and that I would receive this service entirely free of charge. At this point I agreed and they did the first time setup and I took my new laptop home and encountered no further problems until I had traveled back to my home province of Manitoba and I checked my credit card statements and discovered that I was being charged for some Geek Squad subscription based service.My first course of action was to call the store that had originally sold me the laptop and cancel this service. I called the store and they redirected me to a corporate office that dealt with accounts and billing. This office told me that I absolutely could not cancel my service until I was six months in and suggested that I contact the store again to get the problem sorted out. I called back the store and spoke to a different representative. The representative refused to help, telling me to go to a Best Buy location in Winnipeg to have some receipts printed and sort the issue out.I went to the Best Buy location on Pembina Highway in Winnipeg as I was directed to on the phone. I was told, very reasonably, that it was the Waterloo location's or Corporate's responsibility to fix the problem, not the Winnipeg location. However, as I was unable to get help at the Waterloo location or at the corporate level, both Darren and John went above and beyond at the Winnipeg location and did a very good job in assisting me. I found their help and performance to be more than satisfactoryI was also informed at the Winnipeg location that it was apparently somehow possible for Best Buy to charge me for their subscription service without me ever signing a contract AND without a receipt for the services, which, as an individual with a university education in business administration, I find preposterous. Additionally the Winnipeg location told me that I could cancel the service for a fee, whereas corporate continued to insist with me on the phone that I could not cancel the service before 6 months had elapsed",0,3

I waited around at the Apple table with not one employee in sight for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. This is a VERY common occurrence at this store. Finally someone came to help me, and he seemed new so I will give him a break for taking a while to locate the iPad. He rang me out without any further problemsI returned to the store today (7/30), less than 24 hours later, with the original plastic still on the box (I even had an employee tell me how great I was for doing that), to exchange the iPad mini for a Silver iPad mini 4, only to be told that it is no longer on sale for the price I paid and they will not honor that price. For a simple change in COLOR they expected me to pay $100!!! The Assistant Manager told me that it was ""Apple's fault"" and that she wouldn't help me out (even though it should have been a quick swap). I have worked in retail management for many years and I know that if one of my customers purchased something ONE DAY prior but just needed to change the color, you should honor the original price. (I know...people who work in retail read these and think..oh then you should know its not that simple, well it usually IS that simple but you just don't want to take the hit of losing out on $100) I find it absolutely ridiculous and a little insulting honestly, that for a simple change in color she basically told me to pay the difference or get lost.

Best Buy,BUYER BEWARE: HP COMPUTER,"COMPUTER: HP 173 Laptop Intel Core i5 4GB Memory ITB Hard Drive SKU#5623243 Model#17-X121DX ***BUYER BEWARE***First off this computer is just slow, in fact its slower than my old computer of over 5 years that has be dropped a few too many times. Not only is Wifi & internet slow so is the computer's performance all around, takes forever to load even when using apps or programs you will have to wait....and wait. Video & Photo quality is horrible, its pixely, faded, sometimes blurred, changing settings won't make any difference. Watching a movie was like watching a VHS cassette on an old static TV. The DVD drive is broken, it sometime take 3 tries to read a disk, claims there is no disc and make sounds like a jet engine and occasionally sound like it’s a paper shredder. This computer severely underperforms and has cheap, poor design, not worth the money you pay for it. The Wifi Card is bad, defective & slow. You cannot watch YouTube, Google, other media videos higher than 240p or 360p without buffering every 20 seconds or so, you may as well forget watching 720 or 1080p, can't watch Neflix, Amazon or other movies at all...unless you want to watch a minute at a time between buffering. They lie and tell you this computer has ""crisp"" & clear ""HD"" quality, this is a total joke. Last but not least this is personal preference but the to pad/left/right click buttons are stiff, unresponsive, have to press or swipe hard, turned up touch pad sensitivity settings and still felt like I had to pound not tap for it to work. Buttons are cheap, stiff and have to type harder than any other computer I've ever owned. I also personally hate the sandpaper like texture on the touchpad & right side of keyboard...it feel horrible after more than a hour especially if you have to scroll often. Trying to set up printer, internet or personalize apps or desktop....is so not user friendly. Overall this is the worst computer I've ever owned out of Gateway, Lenovo, IBM and Dell. If I could give this computer ZERO STARS I would. Best Buy gave full refund but we had to drive 2 hrs to closest store to return it :(",0,3
Best Buy,"Terrible, tried to rip me off a new item","Terrible. Got an Lenovo laptop for pickup and they gave me one that was repackaged and missing the brown box. Basically, they gave me a RETURNED one but advertised it as NEW. It made sense because there was a problem closing the laptop in tablet mode. I then went to exchange it for another one. The person told me to go get the laptop myself from the electronics section very rudely. Really? This is how you treat your customers. But guess what. Another problem with the new exchanged laptop. It looks like the laptop was smushed from the bottom left side. I've never had any problems buying electronics before. Most likely this BestBuy is selling stuff as new even though it isn't. The workers at the front (not at the electronics section) are lazy and can't do a simple job properly. The people at the electronics section were nice and hard workers though. Will try a different BestBuy and update. I would avoid at all cost. This happened in the BestBuy at Watertown, MA. Maybe they thought I was stupid, that's why they tried to rip me off.",0,1
Best Buy,I bought a laptop from best buy and had …,"I bought a laptop from best buy and had nothing but problems with it. I was constantly having to bring it in because of corrupt hard drives, the screen dying, etc. They were great with sending it off but I was constantly without a computer. Finally on the 4th or 5th time I told them they were going to take it back. On the phone the manager at Best buy told me he would give me a trade and replace my laptop straight across the board for something else and that he had a couple of laptops in mind that were comparable in price and function.When I arrived at the store he told me that there were no choices and that I was going to take home a Lenovo Ideapad 100. He gave me no information on it and when I checked the price it was over 100 dollars less than what I had spent on my other one. I was told that they would only exchange my crap laptop for the current price which had dropped since I purchased it. (Remember, I was usually without it because it was in the shop getting replacement parts). The laptop that they gave me is a rip off and in no way does it compare to the one I spent my money on originally. They wouldn't even discuss upgrading the trade or allowing me to spend more and upgrade to a PC that isn't garbage.Bottom line, if your product is garbage you do not rip someone off by giving them a lesser product by using loopholes like ""o sorry the price went down since you dumped your money on this or it's on sale so that is the only price we will acknowledge. You have lost me as a customer and anyone I talk to will know that you rip people off.",0,1

Best Buy,Best Buy Has Been a Terrible Waste of Time and Money!,"I purchased a refurbished lenovo thinkpad from best buy in december for an upcoming physics course that I had to take. I purchased microsoft office suite and geek squad customer service for one year as well as the laptop from best buy. When I called BB to find out why my office suite was not loading, I was informed that they would have to charge me for their assistance despite the fact that I had purchased their services and the items from them. Then the service rep on the phone put me directly through to what was supposed to be microsoft. In the end, I found that it was not microsoft but a pirate company and that the person BB had connected me with had hacked into my computer before attempting to charge me $49 for his ""services."" He had not done anything at all and I ended up loading office suite myself. This gets better! I have tried to no avail to play dvds. The optic drive is why I purchased this particular laptop but it will not work at all and is not detected by the computer. After spending a lot of time researching, I discovered that this laptop cannot handle windows 10 and the optic drive at the same time. I cannot even use an external dvd player much less save to a disk. I am a teacher working on a master's degree so I need access to the optical drive as much of my past material has been stored this way. I am very frustrated and this has been a very disappointing experience. I will never again purchase from best buy.

If you follow their policies exactly then they are very reasonable and usually no issues but if you are 1 day outside of their return window or you do a no interest financing and are 1/2 a day late, they will not work with you AT ALL. Also, their sales people seem to do whatever they can to convince you to buy something (could just be bad luck though since they are still friendly). I know you could say that's my fault, but the fact that they show no compassion for customers concerns me. I don't know if I will ever buy from them....",0,3

Best Buy,I really want to like them,"I ordered a lovely, new mobile phone from BestBuy. Great price. Great phone. Wow, it was like pulling teeth to get this ordered. Where do I begin ...Firstly let me explain that I am Canadian and live just a few houses from the border. I cross to the USA and have ordered hundreds of items online to a parcel service office in Washington state near my home. I have a US credit card from a US bank with the same parcel service office address for billing. If a website accepts my Canadian credit card I use that one otherwise I use the US card.Best Buy does accept foreign credit cards and has excellent documentation on how to do this. Sadly, the phone number listed in their help for foreign orders is no longer in service. After following their procedures for foreign orders I successfully ordered my phone. Sadly, I was mistaken as the order was cancelled with no explanation. I tried calling but it was ""after hours"" but the business hours were not stated. I tried two more times with different addresses, both additional orders were cancelled without explanation. For all three cancelled orders my credit card was successfully charged as reflected on my banking website.The next day I called BestBuy customer service who escalated the cancellations to another department. Unfortunately they could not take my order by phone because it was for an unlocked phone (huh?). Rather than waiting to hear back I had two backup plans. One, try using a PO Box I have in Washington state or two, use my US credit card. The order successfully went through on my US credit card.I did hear back on the escalation. The three cancelled orders were cancelled because the addresses used are for parcel shipping offices which is not allowed for foreign orders? Wow, Amazon, Best Buy, Zappos, Tire Rack, New Egg and dozens of other companies have no issue with these office. What does BestBuy know that they don't?My order arrived much slower than the promised 2 day shipping but within one week which was acceptable for me. After I got the phone I went online to print a receipt. After logging in and viewing my order the closest thing I could get to a receipt was an ""order details"" page. I looked online at the BestBuy website help and found the instructions on how to print a receipt for an online order. Unfortunately the instructions were, again, incorrect. The instructions made reference to a ""View Order Receipt button"" which did not exist. I called BB customer service and they advised me the order details page print is all they offer in the way of a receipt. No receipt was in the box when shipped. No receipt was ever sent in the many emails from BestBuy regarding this order, nor was a link to a receipt offered. I contrast this with the many other online retailers I have shopped with and can't help the feeling of being underwhelmed.Shopping with BestBuy.com:Pros: - Often good prices on name brand merchandise- Can return to brick and mortar stores- Free two day shipping on many items- Easy to contact customer serviceCons:- Incorrect web pages. The only thing worse than no information is bad information- Bizarre policies that allow orders to proceed then get cancelled without explanation- 2 day shipping not always honored without explanation- No online receipt or invoice- Customer service, while easy to contact, often can't resolve the issuesSummary:Best Buy is a well known national brand that really should be a leader in creating an easy, excellent online experience. I really expected so much more. One only needs to make an Amazon order or two to see just how wonderful a web merchant can be.",0,3

Best Buy,This place has really gone downhill and now they're just plain bad.,"I've shopped at BB for 15 years in 3 different states in 4 different major metro areas.One sleazy thing they have done in recent years is to offer a decent price on the big ticket item THEN all the peripheralsthat you realize you need that go with it when you pick up that item are insanely priced. This is clearly by design, so be prepared (I personally just use other sources - like Newegg - for those items now and highly recommend Newegg or somebody else instead of BB for big ticket electronics)The only time BB is good on black Friday perhaps and/or for the ""gamer's club"" deals; but they are starting to evenblow that angle for me as a customer. My latest transaction with them was an ABSOLUTE DISASTER.I tried to trade in the Madden 16 game for the Madden 17 game - a special offer they have (which they usually also do for FIFA): you get coupons, a discount from the Gamer's Club membership, and a gift card that makes it, at leastmoney-wise, a good offer. The problem is the process is SO complicated at checkout employees are completely baffled and need to consult one another to get it done.It actually took over an hour when I went this year as they were consulting one other and on the phone to various managers to figure out how to do this - letting other customers go ahead as they worked the process out. It was a problem last year as well when they did this, butthis year it was way worse.But in addition to taking over an hour to just do the trade-in on their terminal (the employee had to actually use two terminals to get it done) they could NOT do the pre-order for Madden 17.Apparently, you have to do the pre-order IN STORE to get the full discount. They told me they could re-ring it up when I came back in ... if I pre-ordered online.So I went home and pre-ordered the game online, but when I went back to pick up Madden 17 they still had tons of problems - and could not add the $10 coupon from my trade-in.So I didn't get the full discount that they offered - not to mention the long wait time and headache at checkout.I contacted their online customer service.You know what their solution is? They said this must done in store (no kidding?!) so I need to go back to the store and get them to help.It's as if they didn't even read or recognize my complaint.That was the problem. They can't do it in store. So you're telling me to go back to the store and do it again eh?If Kafka were alive, he would have good source material for a new novel.Shop elsewhere.",0,1

Best Buy,Mistake-ridden process,"I recently bought an open-box bluray DVD player from bestbuy.com. Mistake 1: the item was shipped to me with no power cord or remote control. I called customer service and the woman I spoke with (with the help of a supervisor) suggested I pay for the parts and they would immediately issue me a refund (mistake 2). I went along with this although it made me uncomfortable (the charge was double what I had initially paid for the DVD player). The rep also insisted that I get next-day shipping because, again, they would be refunding all of it. I saw that my credit card was charged and several weeks later, I had not received a refund. I called customer service again and fought with them for over an hour during my work day. The problem was that their system would not let them refund me an amount more than the original order (the parts were 3rd party). The best they could do for me was issue me a refund on my original order and give me a Best Buy gift card to cover the rest. This would have been fine if my faith in Best Buy had not been shattered.

Best Buy,"good service, very good service","""Bought a fit bit before future shop became best buy so I was a bit nervous when it stopped working suddenly! I came into the Oliver square location in Edmonton and was helped out my Mohit. He was fast helpful found all of my old receipts and fixed my problem! Thanks for the excellent service!""",0,4
Best Buy,Not enough hospitality,The website was confusing so I went to the store. The staff have no patience for people who dont know everything about technology. Over priced and will not spend good money somewhere that shows from the first minute you ask a question to the last that they have no care in the world for you or your business.,0,2
Best Buy,I'll shop elsewhere,Return policy is ridiculous in this day and age. Most stores allow returns for weeks to even months with receipt and store credit without receipt. Best Buy offers only a 15-day return with receipt. I purchased a $10 lens cap suggested by the employee and they would not accept a return even for credit only. That $10 I suppose they saved just cost them any future profits from me. I won't bankrupt them but if enough people are fed up..... There are just so many competitors offering similar pricing with much better return policies.,0,1
Best Buy,convenient,"they have what you need, just have to see if it fits your budget.",0,5
Best Buy,Worse,"Never buy anything from BestBuy online.I bought 3 times from BestBuy online, and I was disappointed 3 times. BestBuy sent to me somethings with special price on day, I ordered and few days BestBuy sent email say ""Sorry, my system had problem, your ordered cancaled"".At store of BestBuy, price is not good. BestBuy is not best price.",0,1
Best Buy,Price Match Fraud,"Placed a price matched order and then was told the item was not really in stock, and ship dates kept sliding long past when I could receive the order from the lower-priced store. Best Buy wants to say they price match without actually delivering, from my experience. I won't buy from them again.",0,1
Best Buy,Good all around. great promo prices,Good. Usually only buy from them during their promos - great prices. they have special edition movies that I like.,0,4
Best Buy,Employees on Virginia Commons not friendly,"Employees on Virginia Commons Brook Rd Richmond Virginia are rude and not friendly, will not recommend doing business with this location, employees also racial discrimination, company should take appropriate action for that.",0,1
Best Buy,WORST Buy would be more appropriate name,"Can't find their own items in their stores, Geek Squad provides incorrect diagnoses of problems, clueless about highlighted items in their ads, never enough personnel in customer service (while numerous salespeople wonder the store mindlessly). Try to phone ANY of their stores to get someone on the phone and you wind up talking to someone thousands of miles away who puts you on hold FOREVER if you ask about an item at your local store. All this equals WORST retail experiences of ANY brick & mortar chain today. You're better off buying your next gadget from almost ANYONE on eBay.",0,1
Best Buy,Not bad at all,Big fan of their stores and their website is just as good- customer service could be just a bit quicker but other than that- just right.,0,4
Best Buy,Fast delivery and item was in good condition,Purchased a marketplace item. Delivery was fast and the product was in good condition.,0,5
Best Buy,Really bad Customer service,They gave me such a hard time to return the speakers that i just bought a day before. I got the speakers for my birthday buy my friends already bought it for me. I didn't open the package and wanted to return it. i had to speck with 4 people for it. Eventually i got my money back.,0,2
Best Buy,I feel frustrated by poor attention of sellers best buy,"Today 6-30-2014 fuy to invest in best buy 2700 dollars on a nikon lens 70-200 2.8 VRII and the man who stood in the doorway I reviewed the order online and sent me to see a man who worked in the cameras department, the young made ​​me wait while other vendors were not cerned, after touching my turn tells me that this is not the order unread sends me where customer service and after waiting again tells me that that's not me with her and returns to the previous lord, as this experience and once I lived there I went to the store and buy it online at B & H.com.

No creo que vuelva a comprar en ese lugar.",0,1
Best Buy,Not good service,They are not nice!,0,2
Best Buy,Decent online shopping experience,"If anyone has been to abest buy location, their sales reps are very helpful whenever it comes time to purchase an item. They help with the purchase in person but online you get no such luck. I made the wrong purchase online and had to return the item in person... was a little bit of a hassle.",0,3
Best Buy,Poor communication and customer service,"Was sold a very pricey Dyson sweeper by an uniformed salesperson. I was told upfront that I could return the sweeper for any reason and that Best Buy had a fairly loose return policy so there would be little risk. I gave the sweeper a try only to find that it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 2-3 minutes and I didn't think it was nearly worth the 500.00 that I paid. When I went to return it, I was told that I am beyond the 15 day return period (5 days) and that since they didn't want to ""stick"" me with a bad sweeper, they would give me a store credit. Apparently Best Buy changed their return policy a year or so ago to 15 days and I didn't notice. Not at all what I would have expected based on the conversation that I had with the salesperson. I will deal with the store credit in my way and never do business with this company again. Bad deal Best Buy! I can buy this stuff anywhere. Lesson learned. Store manager treated me really poorly as well. He didn't want to talk with me at all but I insisted and when he finally came to speak to me he was a real jerk. Bad experience all around!",0,1
Best Buy,Convenient,Was able to order on-line and pick-up on the way back from the work,0,4
Best Buy,Will never buy from bestbuy again!,"I've been a bestbuy customer for years and have spent a lot of money with them. Everything was ok until last Dec. I bought some Xmas presents for family. The tracking information showed that packages from bestbuy along with ones from other online retailers got delivered on the same day but when I got home I didn't see any packages on my porch. Most likely, they were stolen from front door. When I contacted the retailers, all of them resend the shipments immediately except for bestbuy. Bestbuy tried to drag this thing for month and tried to blame me . Wasted a lot of time and worst customer service ever.",0,1
Best Buy,Bad customer service,"I've been buying from best buy for years and have their reward card , the first time they should take care of their customer they fail to do so .Bought a defective computer that after 3 weeks it started to crush , tried multiple times to contact the manufacture and best buy and no result .best buy want to charge me for diagnostic on a brand new computer , that's the last time I would ever spend a dime with this company , Do your self a favor and go buy your electronics somewhere else .",0,1
Best Buy,Every time I give them another chance. I am disappointed. I hate Best Buy.,This time the problem is: I ordered a phone with answering system and selected store pick up to have the item today. I get home open the box and it is the wrong Item. I try to email them and there isn't an option. The pick up confirmation does not accept replies and there isn't one on their website unless you want to download something. I call the customer service number tell them I just want to document it. I then get transferred to their call center to hold for 15 minutes before I hung up. Complete waste of time and I still have to find time to take back the item I needed tonight back to the store. I hate Best Buy.,0,1
Best Buy,HORRIBLE SERVICE,My SamsungTV that I bought at BEST BUY broke in one year.Had extended warrantyand its been one month and I still don't have my TV fixed or replaced.I was told by GEEK SQUAD staff that I was lucky to have bought an extended warranty and I should wait as long as it takes to get my problem fixed.In all my years have not had a WORST customer service as I had at BEST BUY.,0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy STINKS,"I bought a wireless controller for x-box 350 for my Granddaughter for Christmas. The controller would NOT connect to the x-box. The lights came on but would not work. I tried to return it to best buy for a new controller, I had my receipt for it. They said because it did not work I would have to return it to Microsoft. I tried to contact corporate office but apparently they do not have one. The supervisor said they did not have a phone number or address that I could get. I want to cut up my best buy card and send it back to them, along with a note about how un-happy I am with them. I will also be contacting the BBB about this company. Maybe that is why this company is in trouble .Target, WalMart, Sears, K-Mart, any other retailer would have exchanged this for me.",0,1
Best Buy,Bestbuy costumer service is very poor  warranty managed at they convenince.,"I used to buy up to 4,000 dollars on products from there but no more , I had an accident whit my laptop and they did not cover it .I call to complain to the costumer service and after 2 hours they talk me that they will be calling me during the next 24 hours today 1 month after still waiting for the call . what a joke I'm not buying from them any more and if you do, not buy insurance from them rip off.",0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy? WORST!,"I ordered 32'' TV with a purchase of extra HDMI cable in one order!I have recieved my TV yet my cable was held back to the post office since they put WRONG ADDRESS. I am wondering, HOW DO YOU GET WRONG ADDRESS ON SAME ORDER?I called the customer service and they are saying this is not BEST BUY's problemso I have to contact local post office about the address. WOW. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!No wonder this company is out of business. Can not get anything right.",0,2
Best Buy,What a SCAM!!! False Promises!!,"I placed an order for an X BOX 360. The 360, not the one. It said i would take 1 week, and arrive on December 24th. Then I get an email on Dec 24th at 1 am telling me that it will take another 1 to 2 weeks at a minimum!! Really..this company is so bad that they can't judge their product reliability within a 2 to 3 week period. Thanks for ruining my Christmas for my son!! What poor service, poor notification, poor up date policy, and poor service!! Just horrible!!! The worst online buying experience I have ever had. So disappointed. To bad Best Buy doesn't know that I also purchase ten's of thousand's of dollars of monitors, televisions, and computers for a local college. I will never do business again with a company like this that mis represents the public. What a joke!!!!!",0,1
Best Buy,Nice Products,I went to my local best buy and was looking for a new phone dock/charger. I need something that would work great and have a lot of power. Unfortunately customer service or staff were nowhere to be found when i needed them,0,3
Best Buy,Not Impressed,"I decided to shop with BestBuy.com for cyber monday because they had a few really good deals. I opted to do in store pickup because I thought it would be easy. The ordering itself was simple. However, I did not get a confirmation email or even a pick up email. I called the store later in the day to find out about the order and I was put on hold for 25 minutes. When I got to the store it was nothing but issues and annoyances. In the end I got the items at a really great deal (half the price of Amazon which is saying something) so I guess it wasn't a total loss. However, I have done site to store with several other stores and never had this many issues.",0,3
Best Buy,Making some improvements,These guys have a hard path ahead of them. I hope they pull through and give the big A a run for it's money.Good Luck Best Buy!,0,4
Best Buy,return policy,Not like most companies with 30 -45 days return policy on electronics The Best Buy will give you 15 days on unopened item. If you open it that good luck. I came to return my Chrome cast today that didn't work with Samsung galaxy tab 2 and HD TV that Best Buy employee guarantied that would. I waited in the line sweet time one clerk was handling returns while other two were ignoring the long line. When manager came and asked one of the associates to help she came with no Hi or thank you. Think twice before you give business to this company. I was the loyal customer up until now.,0,1
Best Buy,Best Buy is a Fortune 500 company with an online commerce infrastructure 10 year out of date. I recommend everyone avoids placing orders with them!,"I placed an order for a Neato Robotic Vacuum on Best Buy's website with the option to ship to store for pickup in 5-7 days. After 10 days of the order stuck in ""Processing"" state, I called Best Buy and representative Amelia had no idea why the order hadn't shipped but assured me that it would be escalated to the appropriate department and that I would receive a call back.Two days later, I received an e-mail that the order was automatically canceled. I called Best Buy to find out why no one had called me back despite promising to update me on the status of the order, as well as find out why it was cancelled. After waiting on the phone for over 15 minutes, the representative claimed that the item was no longer in stock, yet the item is still available for purchase on the website with an option for delivery within 5-7 business days.The entire experience left me with the distinct impression that Best Buy has no idea what it's doing nor how to manage an online commerce business. Their failure to process an order in a reasonable amount of time, irresponsible customer service representatives, and inability to explain why the order was cancelled when the item I order is still listed as available on their website, has lead me to never shop on Best Buy's website again.Best Buy is a Fortune 500 company with an online commerce infrastructure 10 year out of date. I recommend everyone avoids placing orders with them!",0,3
Best Buy,Nice stuff but sometimes pricey,I love my new TV but and the price was a little high... I do like that the warrenty was cheap!,0,4
Best Buy,pretty good overall,"nice website, with nice prices. They are not the cheapest out there, but I like their brand as well as ability for in-store pickup.",0,4
Best Buy,"Strong variety of TVs, hit or miss customer service","I bought a TV at Best Buy. I went back to the store a few times, in between visits, I would research different models to educate myself and make an informed decision. On some of those visits, I was helped by a sales person who had little knowledge of the product or category. On my last visit, when I purchased, I was helped by a very knowledgeable sales person. The shipping was on time and set up was professional.",0,4
Best Buy,Wnat happened to selection of laptops?,"Acer, Acer, Acer? Toshiba, HP....... selection pf brands is 0. what about SONY? I found 1 sony computer on display in the store? just ONE??? What to do if I'm not interested in cheap low-class ACER? Will not be going back to Best Buy ever again!",0,2
Best Buy,Use the collection option,"I spend a lot of time on the road and this makes shopping for hardware a pain. I've been let down by the promised delivery times on the Best Buy website several times. The selection is great, and the prices are OK (I don't mind paying more for the convenience of ""everything under one roof""), but I'm only willing to use Best Buy for the collect at store option now.Even then, I've had a few issues with my order ""going missing"", but usually the staff are helpful enough with this.",0,4
Best Buy,"Good store, poor online support",this store is only good when you go in person. Always have bad experiences with their online store for some reason,0,5
Best Buy,still a good store to come check out products.,the customer service is better now since they revamped their return policy.,0,5
Best Buy,Great for collect at store,"My nearest Best Buy is quite a long trip from my home and workplace. I like to pick items up rather than wait around for deliveries though. I regularly use the BestBuy website to arrange collect at store purchases and have never had a problem. Admittedly, sometimes they're more expensive than mail order only places but the convenience and speed makes it worth using them for urgent purchases.I can't comment on their returns policy because I've never had a problem with anything I've bought. I guess that's a plus!",0,3
Best Buy,What's not to like?,The prices are great. the site is easy to use. Delivery is fast!Now if we're talking about the physical store that's a whole different review!,0,5
Best Buy,Love it,I order whatever I want and it's delivered to my door withine 2 days! One of my favourite places for computer and camera stuff!,0,5
Best Buy,Super Fast delivery and Brilliant price!,"Not only a really good price on a in-demand PS3 game, but it was through my letterbox the next day!Fabulous!",0,5
Best Buy,"OK in a pinch, would rather shop online any place else","While they used to be known for great selection and prices, it doesn't seem to be the case any more. Perhaps my expectations have risen as I've gotten older, but it really seems like there isn't much difference between them and Walmart or Sears these days. Prices are ok, not great. Staff seems a little young and inexperienced. I admit I shop here but not by default. If I can wait, I buy online. If I'm willing to drive, I'd much rather go to Fry's. Fry's has a far better selection and more knowledgeable staff. I would only go to Best Buy if I wanted something today and didn't want to drive for it.",0,3
Best Buy,Decent Price,The price was great! I used their chat feature and it seemed like the people didnt know what they were talking about. I used the pick up in store option and their inventory wasnt updated so I had to drive into the next city in order to even get the speakers. Luckily the price was worth it.,0,3
Best Buy,Overall Great Store,"I only gave bestbuy 4 stars because over the years I have shopped with them they have been a really great store but when it comes to warranty, well lets just say I hope you never have anything break with them. They laptop I am using right now came from bestbuy and it works like a champ and was priced great! Their crew isnt exactly the super smart geek crew they make them out to be as they tend to lack in knowledge on the more technical questions but for the most part they have always been very helpful. I have used their shop online and pick up at the store feature a few times and it worked great just as described! I shop at best buy for most of my electronic needs and as it stands I dont see that changing anytime in the near future.",0,4
Best Buy,3 x fail!,UK FIRM - The delivery of the washing machine was on time and prompt (within the time window purchased from the website). The problems came when I tried to return the product as I wanted to purchase a different version. Called the call centre and arranged collection for Wed (No email confirmation ) as they delivery but don't collect on a Sat. I waited in all day and called the call centre 3 times during the day to which the (helpful but apparently useless) agents said driver is on route. 5.30pm called call centre. they confirmed that delivery company didn't know anything about collection. I stated they would have to collect on the Saturday morning (agent agreed) (No email confirmation). Day before at 9pm received a voicemail stating collection on Monday. Furious rang the next morning (as not open at the time of the call) to which the Best Buy agent stated it will be picked up on Saturday. Again no pickup. I waited on Monday and again no pickup!! Still Waiting to return product! 3 x fail!!!!,0,2
Best Buy,Kept me waiting,Since a lot of unexperienced people shop there - you sometimes have to wait to just buy something that you want. You cant just grab a laptop off the shelf - they need to fetch it for you.Also had a negative experience with Best Buy when I bought a DELL laptop with a very dim screen - returned it the next day because of this defect - which they said is a known issue. but they decided to charge me a restocking fee anyway - Bad Business.,0,2
Best Buy,great buy,"i did buy a printer (kodak esp 9)and everything went well,the delivery was on time,the machine arrived in good condition.no hassles.",0,5
Best Buy,Great place,I ordered a usb memory hub and it worked great. I have ordered many items from many places and I don't usually get what I ordered on time. But this place is good.,0,4
Best Buy,Im satisfied!,I can't believe there are negative comments about Best Buy. Im a customer for over 2 years now and honestly its the best online store I have ever encountered. Prompt service and assistance made me going back to this site.,0,4
Best Buy,Warranty is a fraud,"Purchased a Macbook pro from Bestbuy, was plagued with processor whine. Took it in three times, issue was never fixed. Last time I received it back, it was severely scratched. Took it too the apple store, they actually replaced it even though it was not purchased from them. Buy the Mac's from the Apple store and save yourself tons of trouble.",0,2
Best Buy,dont ever buy a warranty for your ipod here,i bought a warranty for my ipod about a year ago. my ipod broke and i took it in to bestbuy. they said they wouldnt replace my ipod. After arguing with them they said the terms have since changed from when i bought the replacement plan. What a bunch of phonys!,0,1
