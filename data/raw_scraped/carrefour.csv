Carrefour,"Late delivery, missing items & no Share points",I used to be happy shopping online using the Carrefour app or webstore but that was that time they had My Club instead of Share.I stopped using the app after a bad experience. Very late delivery and a lot of missing items which were not out of stock at the time that I paid for them. Share points were also not showing and not credited as well.Contacted them no one is answering the call or even the inquiry sent via their app.,0,1
Carrefour,Carrefour City Center you suck.,"So I go back to Carrefour City Center Bahrain. I wanted to buy a laptop. After deciding on the one I wanted, i just walked out went to Lulu and bought it from them. So Carrefour you lost 330 bd but I guess you make so much money you dont need mine. By the way this is my second review in two days. The attitude of the staff reflects the management/leadership of that store.",0,1
