Costco Wholesale,By far the absolute worst customer…,"By far the absolute worst customer service and experience. Ordered several appliance items and they messed up every one. After over 20 calls with customer service and escalating it to a manager, the still cant figure it out. Complete joke.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,NEVER order online,"I ordered a refrigerator online. Costco Logistic called and sent an email confirming the time and day of delivery. I have been waiting but nothing came on that day. I check my order status, and it states that my order was ""PULLBACK"". Why? Costco Logistic did not call or do something to let me know why they ""PULLBACK"". I call Costco Logistic but nobody answers. It is too sad that Costco Logistic has too bad customer service.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,I ordered Mother's Day flowers from Costco -- they arrived ruined,"I ordered Mother's Day flowers from Costco (to be delivered to my house, so I could check their quality before taking them to mom). Costco sub-contracts delivery to UPS, whose driver, being an idiot (and I watched him pull the box out of the truck), didn't bother to read the box (with ""This Side Up"" stamped prominently all over it), and instead, delivered them upside down -- the way he'd stored them in the truck. Since they were in flower oasis (that green styrofoam stuff) in a heavy bowl, inside of a basket, the combined weight crushed the flowers and ruined the entire arrangement - flowers, soaked and falling-apart basket and all. Okay, only partially Costco's fault, at this point, for subcontracting with the UPS morons, but then I went online to file for a refund. I filed and got an email saying that I needed to box up the ""item"" and ship it back the way it had come. Seriously? For something as perishable as FLOWERS? So I called Customer Service; on hold 3 times (twice dropped on the call), and they said I should have called Customer Service BEFORE I went online and processed the item for a return, because Customer Service can put in a work-around that avoids the need for the customer to rebox and send back. And this is WHERE on their website -- anyone? Anywhere? Exactly -- NOWHERE. Way to go. Fix the darned website, at the least, and don't deliver flowers via a careless, unreliable deliverer like UPS, ferchrissake!",0,2
Costco Wholesale,I purchased toilet paper from costco in…,I purchased kirkland brand toilet paper from costco in Hamilton Ontario. I purchased pre covid wasn't too bad but month ago I purchased but had tons charmin(awsome brand( to go through first. So just opened to try. This is almost the worst toilet paper I have ever used not even a step above from worst public restroom paper . Thin only quarter soft on one side just all around crap and want to return not for money but for better product. Apparently costco doesnt take returns on toilet paper. Prob because changes recipe and know all people who care about wiping would not tolerate this new crap stuff,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco ruined my Mother's Day,"I have had the worse experience with Costco.com this week.I ordered flowers this week from Costco.com for Mothers day starting May 4. They cancelled my order 24 hrs later, then I reordered thinking I did something wrong on my order. 10 hours later they cancelled it again.Then I called and they said I had to take my member number out and re order. Because my card was expired and needed to order non member and pay 5% more. But I told them when I ordered to begin with my membership had expired and I would pay non member price. I did and they charged me in each order that price. Which was fine with me. I havent been shopping at Costco since covid. So I did what she told me and ordered again. I got back cancelled again. So I decided I will just try a different card. The main reason I tried a fourth time is now I am in a position that all the flowers are high priced and picked over for Mothers Day. So I try again.In the mean time, I call my other card to check my balance it is -$150.00..I speak to my card and Costco is holding my money for preauthorizations of all the orders. And I ask how long will this money be held 7 days or more. I am floored, they cancel and they're still holding my money and this long. I try to call to Costco, they hang up on me or just let it ring. I spent 2 hours trying to get through. I call a store and they give me the corporate number. I call and speak to member services, she sends me to commerce. I speak to commerce they say well, you needed to make a new membership account because your not a member anymore. I told them, so why does it say non member 5% cost on my account if I can't order with my regular log in? I know, she says I'm sorry. And then I ask them to return my money, we'll try but really can't guarantee it can happen quicker. So I said, now you've ruined the flower delivery to the Mother of my adopted twin grandchildren. Then you've tied up my money so I can't have a Mothers day weekend. She says sorry. Offers nothing. I will never give one dime to Costco again. I am remodeling my home was looking to buy an outside kitchen. They just lost another $5000 plus from me. I have been a member of their's for decades. Since their original Kirkland store opened. I am very disappointed and upset.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Mask Nazis at Costco,"I was wearing my plastic mask when I entered the store and this mask security guard handed me a paper mask and wanted me to change my plastic mask. I cannot breath on those regular masks, and the plastic mask I was wearing is totally fine for me (covers my mouth and nose). He decided to follow me and tried to harass me into wearing the mask he provided, I mean really? These people feels like they have so much power over your well being now, to the point that they're harassing you just to wear those awful masks. Costco's employees are playing mask natzis!

Costco Wholesale,"costco, police thyself","It's interesting that there are so many complaints here about costco and masks and yet where I live, I don't see any sign that their membership is off. However, they should police themselves because I've seen many of their employees and instacart shoppers not wearing masks properly and I even had one come up to me, take mask down and then give me instructions on how to stand in line and I was more than 10 ft from anyone when she did that. Still the mask issue doesn't bother me as much as the overcrowding and way we get treated like cattle whenever I go there. And, the constant hawking to sell me stuff as I walk in is also pretty annoying. I pay for a membership so someone can pester me while I'm in the store but they can't be bothered to help get a mattress out of the store, or explain why they don't bother to restock those 'bait' items that dragged you there in the first place. Customer service as sams club is just as bad but they have scan and go, and grocery pickup, and they'll tell you before you go what they have in stock online.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Not quite Kosher,"As other have stated Costco is being exposed as too are Trustpilot who have hounded me and Costco have have hounded them, so they bowed to the demigods Costco but persecuted the like of me.

Costco Wholesale,Do not shop through Costco Next,"I have been a member of Costco for over twenty years. I have never had a bad experience with this company until this past December. Before the holidays I bought three sets of Dearfoam slippers through Costco Next. Unfortunately, two of the three slippers I purchased as gifts did not fit. I have been trying to return the two sets of slippers, but have been getting the run around. Costco promotes shopping through Costco Next, but their employees cannot provide any helpful information regarding the return process. I would not recommend shopping through Costco Next.

Costco Wholesale,Make your Yes Mean Yes Costco...,"Good day, we made a purchase of a MacBook Pro on Costco.com and the promotion at the time stated that we would get a $250 shop card from the store and also a $250 discount if we applied for their Citi Visa card and completed the purchased. The advertizement was very dicieving and did not state that you would not get the card instantly as you do at other retailers in order to make the purchase within the required time. We visited the store to expedite the process and we were told that they could not assist. Once we received the card, we made the order and called to request the $250 shop card and also the $250 Citi Visa discount. The representative from Costco.com stated that he was unable to place an adjustment on an item that had not posted yet and to call back and that they will issue the credit adjustment. Upon doing so we are now told that even with their 30 price adjustment policy, they cannot issued the shop card or provide us with the Citi Visa discount.This is very sad as we have purchased many high value items over the years and were told by their staff on a recorded line that they would. Please be careful of the false advertisement and don't be tricked into getting a credit card...",0,1
Costco Wholesale,We had a horrible experience at…,"We had a horrible experience at Sarasota, FL Costco twice. Really rude employees about mask mandate. in one instance my husband was eating some food from their side restaurant. As he was eating he had his mask down when an employee was super nasty about him not having his mask on. The employee without saying a word made a notion of ""pull your mask up"" with his hands. After my husband showed him he was eating food the employee proceeded to tell my husband after each bite my husband should pull his mask up. The employee did it with a really ugly attitude, his action was super nasty and uncalled for and ridiculous. This kind of treatment of customers will result with lost business. And perhaps that's what has to happen for this behavior to be stopped. There should be respect for customers who spend their $$ at the store. Customers that come and shop at the store should not be treated like criminals.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Horrible Service With Product Installation,I bought a cooktop with installation included and the delivery people said they don't install so they'd get someone who would.

Costco Wholesale,Costco Cash Out System,"Just visited Costco and once again my experience with the cash out system was very annoying. Anyone notice that Unlike other large retailers, Costco's cash out register does not tell you your total until the end or you have to stop the cashier midway to ask what is your total. Secondly I was wondering why the cashier was racing to scan the items not allowing the customer to ensure that the price is the same as the one on the shelf. Well a few minutes later I got my answer as I was waiting on the line to check my receipt. Right there on the wall were names of cashiers and the amount of items they cashed every minute. It looks like the company promotes some sort of competition among them to see who could cash in a less amount of time. Not everyone is rich and has lots of money some of us have to carefully manage our finances so I would like the opportunity to view my total after every product is scan and not have the cashier rush through my groceries as if she was working on commission. Thank You.. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.....",0,2

Costco Wholesale,Sad experiece at Costco today,"Was rejcted a Costco credit card, dont know why as my credit score is 880 out of 900. Called up Capital One, and the lady at the other end of the phone was very rude and was talking down on me after she heard my accent perhaps, and refused to give me any information. Went to Costco today and when my card was run through, they made me show my card again after they scanned it and about 2 other Costco agents and a supervisor then gathered round to check on me. Not sure what popped up on their screen and if they have marked me in a bad way after the woman from Capital One dealt with me. (not sure if she was being racist towards me) Felt very insulted, as they made me feel like I was a scam. Heard that Costco can just cancel your membership if they feel like it, although you may have not done anything. Very sad that Costco treats its customers badly. Most reviews about Costco seem to be negative on this site, and nothing seems to be done about it, as they know they are a giant company and most small guys like me, mean nothing to them.

We were already pissed because my husband took leave for this so he can build it well it will not happen.Then night before second delivery date we got call that it would be delivered at 5 to 7pm.

No. Of course not.We called and they said it is at the warehouse and that warehouse is closed of the weekend so they can't do anything until Monday. Are you freaking kidding me?They suck.

Costco Wholesale,Never purchase an appliance from Costco.com,"I purchased a Samsung Appliance suite from Costco.com at the end of July 2020.

Costco.com got the appliance fixed on 2/23, but now it is 4/17/21 and the dishwasher still isn't installed. I've spoken with the major appliance team dozens of times and even spoke with a manager twice. I was told they needed ""special permission"" to get it reinstalled. I finally heard from them four days ago they had the permission, which in and of itself is ridiculous, but no one has contacted me to set a time for the installation. I can't repair my floors until the dishwasher is reinstalled. Given my horrible experience they should have made the installation a priority, but they have not. And just now after being on hold on the phone with Costco.com customer service for over 30 minutes I was told the appliance team has no record of my issue. This is unacceptable service.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,I'm a roadshow vendor and I have been…,"I'm a roadshow vendor and I have been doing Costco roadshows for over five years. I'm also I Costco member since 2015. I recently did several ten day shows in southeast Costcos. Costco is very rigid with their policies and procedures and, although over the top on occasion, I have respected them for it.However, the last roadshow convinced me I was being targeted because I'm a middle aged white male.The assistant general manager was on me for no reason from the beginning and lied to my company about my whereabouts and the condition of the show. She harassed me about a shopping cart in use during store open hours while ten feet away the Costco employees were doing the same thing. Of course my company started the whole problem by not scheduling the show according to the Costco general manager.My contact told me that the assistant general manager said I wasn't there on Saturday and I needed to get back to Costco and communicate with her about that . Upon returning to the Costco, a mid-level manager said he'd already told my company I was there and he thought it was humorous. I still don't think it was humorous and I deserve an apology from all parties. On a side note, lot's of members vocalizing their displeasure for removing palmetto cheese over BLM protests in Charleston.

Costco Wholesale,I bought a mattress from Costco.com. Updated.,"I bought a mattress from Costco.com. Their system automatically assigned a delivery date which was not approved by me. OK. So, I go online and use their system to change the delivery. New delivery is accepted by their system. No problem. The night before delivery I get an email and then on the delivery day I get a text giving me a 2 hr window for delivery. Plus, text says I will get a call from the driver prior to delivery. So far, so good. Now comes delivery day and the 2 hr window is up and I’ve heard nothing. I took the morning off to wait for delivery. So, I call Cust Serv and they tell me mattress was not even at the warehouse! Therefore, was not loaded on the truck for delivery. WAIT, WHAT?? I tell CS about the email, text and this is the best one WHY DIDNT I GET A CALL TELLING ME DELIVERY WON’T HAPPEN!! Her response was we have no control over the delivery. Again, wait, what??? The friggin website says “Costco Logistics”. That sounds like control to me. OK. Short version. Delivery was rescheduled for today. I get the email, text, even a voicemail all confirming delivery. Guess what?? Deja vu all over again. No mattress, nothing. I call again. This time they tell me the truck does not come my way on this day. WHAT??? I got triple confirmations for delivery!!! OMG. I was fit to be tied. Unbelievable. I like shopping at Costco. But, buying something big that has be delivered by truck is a nightmare. Costco really really needs to get this part of its business together. Left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. Totally incompetant, unacceptable delivery system and customer service. I am ready to cancel my order.Here's an update. The third time is the charm. I had to escalate my delivery issues to a manager, then a regional manager got involved. Really?? This had to go that high up for resolution? Costco really messed this up. Well, my mattress finally got delivered. I love the mattress. Costco did reimburse me for an 'inconvenience fee'. Advice - if you order from Costco.com a large item that Costco will deliver (not UPS, Fedex) regardless of the email and text confirmations call the Cust Serv number the day of delivery and confirm that your order is on the truck and will be delivered as scheduled. Then, you should get a call from the delivery person confirming that they are on the way with an ETA. Then you will get your order.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,I thought Costco was known for their customer service. Guess that’s for select customers,"Bought an refrigerator online and scheduled the delivery during the check out process. Delivery, installation, and haul away is supposed to be included. On the morning on the delivery, the driver calls to let me know he was on the way. He asked if I had a haul away, which I did, and he proceeded to tell me that I needed to show proof that I PAID for a haul away because “it wasn’t on his sheet,” even after telling him that haul away is included with Costco, he was adamant that I needed to show him proof. I told him that if he can’t take the old fridge, I can’t take the new one (no space) so there wasn’t a point to coming. I called Costco and they were all very confused why the driver would tell me that I needed proof and that haul away definitely was included at no additional cost. Since he was unable to take the haul away due to working alone, the delivery was rescheduled for the next morning. Mind you, my old fridge was broken for about a week, so now we had another day without a working fridge. I have been working with customer service on rectifying the issue and at this point, I’m upset because I’m not sure why the driver harassed me about proof of paying for a haul away. Talking with various reps, I was basically blamed for NOT SELECTING THAT I HAD A HAUL AWAY, yet there was never a prompt for that information at all. After talking the check out process thru with a logistics manager, she realized that customers are able to schedule delivery during the check out process, which is a new feature and that they were unaware of. Meaning the old process of purchasing an appliance, which was check out, and then receive a link to schedule delivery etc, was outdated and apparently not communicated. Due to me spending literally over 3 hours on the phone at this point, the logistics manager agreed to provide a $150 credit due to the harassment and clearly a failure of internal processes at CostCo. I would have been OK with the error if the driver didn’t insist that I needed proof of payment for a haul away. And he was rude about it, like I was dup’ing him into taking the fridge for free. Anyway, 3 weeks later I’m still waiting for my credit. Called 4/3 and was told I would receive the credit within 5-7 business days. Called 4/14 since no credit had come through and they have zero idea what the hold up is. They stated that the form was submitted OK but they aren’t sure why it wasn’t processed. Like seriously, is this a business or a scam? Not to mention, the driver tried to extort me for a haul away that was supposed to be included with the appliance purchase at no additional cost. At this point, it’s principle. Costco offered the $150 credit to me, so I’m confused as to why I cannot receive it. You also cannot ever talk to a manager directly. You’ll be placed on a call back list, but I never received a call from anyone. No accountability; just empty apologies and trying to push the blame off to the customer.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,DO NOT ORDER FROM COSTCO.COM,"Do not purchase any items online if you do not want to be disappointed. We purchased a Washer and Dryer on February 06, 2021. You have to call the delivery company yourself to schedule a delivery after you receive an email. They use a very very poor logistics company named XPO. We contacted the shipping company to be told that they could only delivery every other Monday but the next date they had was March 17th. This is over a month a almost two weeks later of not having my items that I paid for. They arrived and the dryer fell apart. I was very pissed. They told me that Costco would be in contact with me but no one called me. I reached out to Costco on March 31st and they had no record of this issue. The manager placed a replacement order. She was supposed to follow-up back with me but never did. I received an email stating to contact XPO once again to schedule a delivery. I reached out to this this time and I was told that they are completely booked for the month of April 2021 and that the next date they had available was May 10, 2021.

I had a collection time of 12 I arrived just after that and there was a hour plus long qué. I called the customer service for the Bristol branch where I was collecting and asked if it could just be taken to the customer service desk so we could collect it and it couldn't be done. The staff member on the end of the phone told us if we didn't collect it then it would just be thrown in the bin. Ruined my friends birthday as we ended up with no cake. Poor customer service. Also ridiculous how they would sooner throw food in the bin than sell it. Discusting knowing of all the poverty in our country!,0,1

When I called MIchelle at Costco customer service a week after getting a tracking number for the shipment via Ceva she was put on hold by the 3PL. She hung up from Ceva after 5 min. and told me she was not able to hold any longer than 5 minutes when attempting to track my order due to Costco policy and I would have to wait 3 days for another Costco department to get back to me. I still don't have my mattress and I still don't know from Costco where it is.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Recently purchased a membership,"Recently purchased a membership through my employer online. Took paperwork to COSTCO in Nashua, NH and went to service desk where desk employee Robin welcomed myself and the wife. Extremely pleasant lady who asked if we had some time to spend with her so she could explain all the benefits. To make a long story short, she enticed us to upgrade our membership level and to take out the Costco Visa credit card. Both ended up making sense as they hopefully will save us money in the long run. Costco offers a guarantee that you will save the price of upgraded membership, or they will reimburse the difference at the end of your first year and downgrade you to the lower level of membership. Costco Visa is worth it just for gas which saves you 4% at ALL gas stations. Robin is a terrific customer sales rep. Not sure she could sell me the Brooklyn Bridge, but she was very sweet and excellent. Made new membership even more worthwhile.",0,5

I wrote Costco customer service. They wrote back and told me who I was and wasn't with, what time I came in, what register I used, when I exited the building. Is this the Costo in Dallas Georgia or a Liberal run concentration camp? They told me I had to come in to cancel my membership and get a refund. I told them I don't have the right kind of mask and am not intelligent enough to figure out how to wear one. So I am not allowed in your establishment.

Costco Wholesale,Poor air conditioner estimate and courtesy,"We had an estimate from Collins AC in Arizona which was $600. more than a higher Lenox model and did not include a new thermostat. Also, the Better Business Bureau recommends that the installer come back in a week or so to check the unit; yet when I asked I was told that was not the company policy. Additionally, the other company NOT recommended by Costco will do a free checkup in the fall and in the summer.Despite the gift card offered, it was a bad deal, surprising as we like shopping at Costco and expected a competitive price and better service.The Collins representative returned a call we made asking about the thermostat and the much higher estimate for them to install one which was emailed to me by someone else at the company, but as it was an inconvenient time for us we only got to question it and asked if we could call back. Our return call later that day was not returned. Good thing, as it prompted us to look at another Lenox dealer which gave a better price and for a higher model, plus good service!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Spent nearly a week trying to buy a…,"Spent nearly a week trying to buy a washer and dryer from them because their site wouldn't let me and the phone customer service rep wasn't helpful at all, just blamed my bank even though they took the money out and didn't create an order, when the money was back i went in store and had to call them from in the store with an employee, took over an hour of them telling me to do the same stuff over and over instead of just placing the order for me over the phone like i asked originally. Eventually they had a ""tech"" remove the item from my cart and change stuff then had me put it back and place the order, it finally worked and i got the confirmation and she asked what else she could do for me and i asked what would be done about all my wasted time due to your systems error and was flat out told nothing, so i had her get me a supervisor because i just spent $3800 and have been spending $300 plus weekly for months there and the supervisor not only told they ""dont composite for lost time"" but she also lied about my order and told me it actually won't go through because my billing address had a ""+4"" on the end of it. Ive looked the order confirmation and my banks billing address up and down and they both match perfectly and there is no +4 to be seen anywhere. The girl in the store helping me was even shocked about the whole situation and couldn't believe how they treated such a good customer. However this is just proof that this store does not care about its customers as much as they'd like you to think. Ive spent $2 on fast food and got something wrong and they give you an entire meal on the house to make it right but at costco you spend $5000+ within 3-4 months and your still a pos to them. I will not be returning and if the order for the W&D does get delivered it will be the last thing i ever receive from them. The employees in store were excellent i must add, its a shame the phone people aren't. Just to add, i wasn't expecting some huge thing, maybe a membership upgrade or 20% code a gift card, anything. They could of offered me a free pizza from their own food area and i would of been like cool thanks, but nothing for their own sites issue. smh",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco holds no responsibility for promoting worthless vendors,"Purchased System thru Costco ,which turned out to be huge mistake . Costco claims that they just put the vendors in the stores but have no connection with them . What a cop out from a chain like Costco, never again . Salesman came out in BMW , dressed like he was going boating that day. Tested the water & told us what we needed . We signed up ,got our equipment. Lasted less than a year because of internal machine problems that filled to top of salt tank with water. We called and told them we were having problems with the water and they wanted to charge us (prepay) to come out and put chemicals in the equipment without checking it first. The problem ended up being the equipment which all was under warranty . It took us 3 weeks to finally fix it but only because I called Costco, Channel 8 & 10 and also manufacture which is out of state. After all the complaining we did, the owner himself came out and suggested are water has changed and that we needed more equipment for around $2000 in addition to two pieces we already have . We're still getting rust and a metal smell from the water. Definitely can't wash whites but we do a water system that cost $3300 . I wouldn't recommend Eco Water systems to anyone . I would give them a no stars if I could.",0,1

We call the customer service line, we get hung up on and call back. This time we get an actual person. They are telling us we have to take the box back to our local Costco and wait 5 days for a refund. So we end up having to repurchase the entire order basically, that got shipped to the wrong address, and were told it had two day shipping. It then shows up four days later and we get double charged for everything. So we spend another hour and a half on hold after being hung up on twice, to get no help. The send is to a manger named Jessica who did nothing and was extremely rude. This has been stressful and expensive, this company is incompetent and rude, I want my money back for this membership and to never have to deal with them again. And they were like what were you expecting, and at this point I would really like an actual apology for this run around and how we have been treated.

Costco Wholesale,Worse experience for our Budget Truck rental from Costco Service,"Worse experience for our Budget Truck Rental booking from Costco- DO NOT USE Costco online services. after 16+ years using Costco, it seems they do not need customer anymore.--> We booked Budget Truck Rental with pickup at 4:00PM from '10220 Palm River Rd ,Tampa, FL, 33619'. This address also showing 'EMBASSY SUITES BY HILTON '.-->There was very small sign board for Budget which is not easily visible. Specially when you look for Budget truck or U-Haul Truck, you do not expect some truck rental location inside such hotel. So we passed the address and took some time to reach exact location. Possibly 10 min late then pickup time of 4:00PM. When we reached, we show rental office is inside hotel. And when we reached, office was closed. And Hotel receptionist informed they just left couple of minute before.We were totally lost what is going on. We tried to call all possible number to connect with Budget from reservation confirmation page. Even we tried calling number which was posted on door. But some number was even not working or going on voice message etc. and customer service from Budget's answer was, ""this is Costco booking and we do not have such booking. Contact Costco"".We tried calling Costco and we did not got any support to get hold of Budget truck rental. Even they hang-up phone instead of transferring to manager or supervisor.Somehow one person could got our reservation. And he told, if office is closing at 4pm, he can not do anything.finally we took help from local Costco warehouse manager, they ware trying to help us but Budget and online Costco travel was not helpful to them either.After 2-3 hours of our struggle, we finally came to home and booked U-Haul in night for Saturday pick-up at 10:00AM. I am very impressed with U-Haul, they called 9:45am on Saturday that our truck is not available at our choice location but they will arrange as soon as possible. And they provided confirmation for 2:30PM pickup. And they even texted earlier that truck is ready and we can pick up earlier.When we were talking, some customer service people were acting like we are speaking some Greek language. This time we felt they are doing purposely to give hard time.During all such calls, some customer service person even cancelled our reservation instead of getting truck from other location or asking same location to give truck early in the morning.Somehow we got truck and reached to destination to pick-up our stuff. We stayed overnight whatever hotel we got near destination. So in morning half we can load our stuff in truck. You know, how you get last minute hotel booking etc.",0,1

In Laws received a call in Feb to schedule the install?

Received it in Nov. fine but after using it and ruling out thing found the range was not working properly. Called in Jan. to the concierge services, two weeks of back and forth between Samsung and Costco, first excuse they couldn't find anyone who would come and repair the unit, come on I live just outside of Seattle there is a Costco less than 2 miles from my home, also don't sell items you that you can't service. The last excuse that I couldn't pin down where this lie came from but I was told it wasn't under warranty because it was damaged and that it was Costco's problem. I never said it was damaged, it was the induction burners weren't working. Near the end of that I was put in touch with Josh with major appliances, he acted as a ""case worker"". He seemed to want to help and fix these situations, he was really good but the company even failed him.With no repairs available for my stove I am then told they do not have any units in stock so they in 5-7 days to schedule the pick up and refund us 2-3 days after pick up. What? wait? now I need to order a new range which I know will take at least a month! I won't get the money for the range 2-3 days after pick up?! Received an email Jan 27th of all these details, they didn't call to pick up I had to call Josh, he rattled cages and got the range picked up on Feb. 12. Pick up happened just find on Feb 12th. So figuring the 12th was a Friday, I assumed we should have the refund I don't know the following Wed, no refund, called the week of the 22nd and here comes the excuses. They have the convenience of blame shifting other departments within Costco (all not the customers problem), then one of the ecom reps said that the refund request came in on the 24th and I needed to give it 5-7 business days this is after Josh told me I should receive it on the 26th and if not call on Monday, wait what happened to 2-3 days, Then it was well the hold up was because of the storms and power outages.

Either you’re too weak to be a delivery worker, or too lazy. After calling out his BS he begrudgingly walks another 15 feet and immediately says that they can’t install the unit, it’s too big.I know the dimensions of what we ordered, 27 wide, and 77.5 high stacked. The door frame is 31 and 81. He says it won’t fit. So either they delivered the wrong size (again) or he’s being lazy and lying about it. He calls his boss, his boss says there’s no policy about 2 floors, and they wouldn’t need 6 people to move a single washer unit.Dude ends up taking a picture and leaving and says customer service will call. I see him and his partner on the street. They remove one of the units from the box on the street, put it in the truck, then lift the boxed unit themselves (no ramp, no assistance) and put it on the truck...so I guess that they CAN lift it after all.Three strikes in a row. Utterly insane how incompetent this is. I will never order appliances from Cost Co again and will advise friends to avoid them as well.Oh, and they tried to avoid giving us a credit for the earlier mishaps. They credited the purchase after we pointed it out. Sorry guys, we noticed.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Costco Online is Disorganized and a Bad Customer Experience,"First and last time I'll ever use Costco online to buy anything. We went to Costco following installation of a solar system through Sun Run and getting a pretty nice Costco Card as a benefit; Sun Run is awesome by the way. The washer was set to have an estimated delivery time of almost a month but given we were using a gift to buy it and haul away and installation were included we were happy to wait. We were then pleasantly surprised to find out late in the week prior to the scheduled delivery that it would be delivered early. That is where everything fell apart. The delivery company and installation company are separate and when Costco called to set up the delivery/installation they were not aware their installation team was two weeks behind delivery teams. I get that it’s COVID and that installation company was actually closed for two weeks, I would presume due to an outbreak, but the fact that Costco had no back up and was not aware of the outbreak is a pretty big logistical and communication breakdown. I made due though, I really did not need installation and Costco confirmed their delivery team could handle the haul away if I had the old washer uninstalled when the delivery guys arrived. I agreed, dishwasher installation is little more than plugging a plug into a socket. The night before delivery I received a call confirming a two hour window for delivery and based on that information I uninstalled my dishwasher the morning of delivery. When the delivery team did not arrive I called the same number that scheduled my time the night before and was told that while there was no explanation my delivery would not happen as scheduled. I explained my situation and the rep on the line said there was nothing they could do that they could not even figure out why the item was not being delivered. I asked to speak to a manger/supervisor and was placed on hold. I was on hold so long that I had time to write this review up to this point. When someone finally came on the line it was the same rep who said they spoke to their supervisor and the item could not be delivered due to weather (this is still funny) the item according to Costco’s tracking app had been in Ontario and Sylmar in Southern California since the Friday before delivery, no more than 50 miles from my house where it is currently 75 degrees and had been for about a week. I did finally speak to a supervisor she agreed that weather could not be an issue but there was nothing they could do as the delivery company was in charge and they are not Costco and even if their explanation was obviously ridiculous they could not do anything. When I asked if the delivery company was Costco Logistics and were they not part of Costco she said they were and that then she could get on the phone and call them to find out what the delay is. One second she can’t do anything but the next she can make a call when it is pointed out that they are actually the same company? I could not imagine having a customer facing employee do this. So how does the saga end? After 1 hour and 4 minutes of perfectly clear communication the supervisor comes back on the line and says she cannot hear me and says she will be ending the call due to lack of response and hangs up. I called back to Costco Membership and they transferred me back to Costco online, the new rep at least seemed like they were trying to help and they clearly understood the issue but they could not reach the warehouse and get an explanation even though they acknowledged there was no way this was weather related so there is nothing they can do. They have set us up with a new delivery date for March 2nd, or six days from now.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,"CHICKEN TORTURERS, MO LAW BREAKERS, TIRE CENTER HAVOC, LEFTISTS FREE SPEECH BANNERS!","CHICKEN TORTURERS. FREE SPEECH BANNERS. LAW BREAKERS OVER FORCED MASKS IN MISSOURI. Mike Lindell spoke about truthful election fraud, OR illegal election activities like #RubyFreeman, #60,000underagevotersvotedinGA, massive dead people voting, illegal election ballot harvesting, out of state voters voting, 2,000 registered voters in Arizona to one commercial address, etc., AND they have the audacity to consider removing his products?! I spent over a $1,000 on MyPillow last year, through Amazon, I love our pillows and sheets! They wash up better than the $350 sheets I’ve bought, or any of COSTCO sheets I’ve purchased for some 18 years. This year, thus far, I’ve spent $350 directly from Mike; my future purchases will be directly from MyPillow, not Amazon or COSTCO. When I emailed the CEO’s assistant about MyPillow and how COSTCO is forcing medically exempt people to wear masks, against MO LAW, some lame woke ignorant college intern, was disrespectful and uncaring! COSTCO tire center in AK damaged the roof of my son’s first truck and refused to pay for the damage. They were rude and hateful. Corporate had some foreigner from India 🇮🇳 handle the call and pushed all of the responsibility from COSTCO, blaming the insurance. They are LEFTISTS, do not buy from them! Leftists HATE the USA 🇺🇸 They want to destroy it. I won’t buy from them anymore! Their furniture is cheap and flimsy. COSTCO’s meat 🥩 has BLOOD 🩸 dripping from it, I have photos. It’s disgusting and unhealthy. Videos emerged of COSTCO chickens who can’t walk because they’ve been bred to be big, or maybe it’s diseases from all of the filth, I don’t know, I just know that where I come from chickens can walk! COSTCO is cramming chickens into tight inhumane quarters! Just to make a buck: if they don’t care about chickens, they don’t care about you! These chickens suffer ammonia burns and live in sheds that do not get cleaned for weeks! You want to eat a chicken that lived in excrement and filth?! Or one that was tortured by horrendous living conditions? COSTCO is just too big for their britches. if they don’t care that they’re breaking the law in Missouri, why would they care about animals in their care?!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Extremely incompetent customer service of costco.com,"Super disappointed by the customer service of costco.com. I'd admit we have long been satisfied with the quality of costco warehouse, but that does not applies to its online shopping experience.I recently ordered a kitchen mixer with $100 discount but its status remained ""order received"" for 10 days. So I called the customer service asking what happened. The first agent kept saying that it is ""out of stock"" and canceled the order without my consent. Apparent when I ordered the item it was still in-stock and even so a few days after I placed the order (just checked out of curiosity), so she was apparently lying. Had to call costco another 3 times until somebody can finally figured the simple fact that this cancellation was not requested by me. Took me another 2 hours speaking to both costco agents and even the vendor but the only resolution was that they could do nothing to ""de-cancel"" the item, and I may order the item when it becomes available again then request a price adjustment. I'd say I didn't want to waste more time and agreed to the resolution. Then guess what? Just a few hours later I received emails from costco saying ""cancellation request was declined because the item has already been shipped""! Just like a joke, the incompetent customer service of costco wasted my whole afternoon. Combining my several previous experiences with costco telephone service, their performance was just way below expectation.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,The WORSE ( not said lightly) Experience and WORSE customer service with getting our appliances delivered,"If I had the chose I won't even rate it 1 its that awful. My husband and I shop at Costco for many years now. We were on the hunt for a great deals and sales on appliances and searched at many different stores and Costco had the better deal on appliances during the president day. So we decided to buy the full package stove, microwave, dish washer and refrigerator from Samsung and we were extremely excited however, we read all the reviews online and their delivery crew rated so poorly so bad but we didn't think or would know it was going to be a nightmare. We just liked the huge sales and deals $1200 off and plus 10% off during president day. On their websites it stated it won't arrive until March or April. We got a call then an email that our appliances were arrive on 2/19/2021 between 8:00am - 11:00am. So my husband took the entire day off from work so he can be here and deal with it when they arrive. On 2/18/2021 later in the evening we got an automatic answering machine states as a voicemail that our delivery order won't arrive until 1:45pm -3:45pm Friday on 2/19/2021. My poor husband waited for them all day and of course just our luck we had the worse delivery crew. They failed to communicate when they will be arriving no call no text. We kept calling customer service to get a status update. The two guys showed up at 3:15pm knocking on the door again they failed to call us or text us. The one guy came through the front door and saw we have stairs now to state we live on the upper level of the condo and no way on the package states can't do stairs. That same man left for 5 mins 5 long mins and then came back to the house and told my husband that his ""back was hurting"" are you kidding???!! What a bulls**** that is he is lying beneath his teeth. He looked fine to me when he entered the front door. Wth dude seriously!! This is part of their job and what we paid for that was included in that package deal. If this guy has back problems maybe this isn't the job he should be doing. At this point we are both angry and I have already had enough of this stupidness and games. The two guys decided that it was best for them to drop off my appliances in the garage and leave completely leave without finishing the job or even taking the old ones down and taking the new ones up and installing them which all was included in the package. The one guy who claimed his back was hurting which is bulls**** told my husband that they will return on Monday to take care of this and had us set up for appointment and that is another lie as well because we called the customer service and we were on the phone for over an hour to speak to someone. We come to find out that guy lied because we weren't even scheduled on Monday they were supposedly ""booked"" so now we are scheduled a week and day later for them to come back and do their jobs. If I wasn't working I probably would have give it to them so bad. This is ridiculous and very unacceptable and very down dirty for Costco hiring these third party delivery company. Costco you disappointed us. The worse customer service we had to deal with, they were extremely rude, unpleasant and unprofessional. When they come back next week I will have them open each package and will investigate each item and parts closely. If I find anything that is damaged my walls, my appliances or anything. It will be Hell break less. They left and had no care in the world this is not how you treat customers. Very unprofessional very uncalled for absolutely disappointed very sickness. Trust I know how customer service works I worked for many years in customer service and want to make sure the customers are happy and satisfied with your services. Costco this is down dirty. Please fire them and get a better delivery crew that are honest, professional, smiles on their faces, great reviews and rating, friendly, and actually do their job from the start to the finish. Provide a better customer service and make the customers happy and complete their order what they paid for from A to Z. Otherwise this continues I will inform all my family and friends about this experience and will advice them not to purchase through you.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,DON'T ORDER FURNITURE FROM COSTCO!!!,"Beyond disappointed!!! We ordered 2 leather couches and paid the additional $120 for the so-called ""White Glove"" delivery --- meaning items are unboxed, assembled, set up and all boxes and packaging hauled off.

He reminded the delivery guys that it was a ""White Glove"" delivery. Their response was , ""Sorry, see ya!"" What the heck Costco?!?! So, I have been on the phone, in and out of Hold for the past 5 hours. Each time I'm told someone is on their way to set it up. Well, it's Friday night at 7pm and we are the proud owners of 2 huge boxes filling our living room and nothing to sit on. You would think $2400 would be good for something! So beyond disappointed!!!

Costco Wholesale,what a nightmare.,"My wife and I love the warehouse. However the online is a nightmare. We’ve had some issues in the past with online ordering but this last time is very disappointing. We placed an online order for Franks hot sauce, Olive Oil, Biscoff etc... The first delivery was damaged in transit and never arrived. Incalled the young lady sent out a replacement order. We received the replacement and the box was severely damaged so I took pics. Opened the box and it was filled with what looks like 2 12 packs of Bai drink and not one item I ordered. I called and was supposed to have UPS pick up the Bai and Costco was to send out my irder a third time. We got an email saying they were going to come pick up the items I didn’t receive. I called again yesterday and was told I had to wait 7 days to see what will happen. This is unacceptable. I just want my order please. We shopped at the warehouse all the time. Them we moved but renewed anyway to order online which we have ordered anything from Mattress to laptop to Sweats to Food. This is the first time writing a review for Costco but not the first with a bad Costco.com issue.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Grrrrrrrrrrr...,"This weekend I ordered (as a non-member which is an additional 5% charge) an ECOVACS Robotics DEEBOT OZMO T8 AIVI Robot Vacuum & Mop. After my card was charged for the order I received an email from Costco saying that my order had been CANCELED and my card was not charged. However, when I went to my bank, my card was charged. When I called to see what happened I spoke with Crystal, an account representative, who I spent almost an HOUR or the phone with. She concluded that my order was cancelled in “ERROR” on their end. She was finally able to restore my order. However, I asked her since the error was on their end and my their error caused the shipment of my order (almost $1000 order) to be delayed by a few days, if they would upgrade the shipping to “make things right” so that I could still get my order within the time frame of my originally placed order, she said that she could not. When I told her that I was going to share this NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE on-line, she placed me on hold again only to return saying that there was nothing she could do. So, my first experience with Costco.com 1. They cancelled my order in “error”. 2. They CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD anyway, even though they sent me an e-mail stating that they had not. 3 Then I had to spend an hour out of my day trying to understand what had happened and correct THEIR ERROR. 4. It will now take additional days for me to receive my order even though it was no fault of my own. 5. Costco accepted no responsibility for their error, or the layers of inconvenience it has caused me. So, if you’d like to have a VERY POOR BUYING EXPERIENCE as I have, go ahead and place your order and take your chances. If you would rather NOT have such a poor experience yourself, there are a lot of on-line retailers out there who actually value their customers enough to not put them what Costco did (and other companies step up to make thing right if they do mess up)",0,1

We were going to shop, but it had been a while since we had been there, so we stopped at the customer service counter to see if our membership was current. We were attended by a man named Cosmo. I told him that I wanted to check the status of my account and handed him my card. He got on his terminal and it took what seemed to be a very long time for just a simple check to find out if it was current. I interrupted him and asked,""Is it current?"", he said,""no it expired last May, would you like to renew it?"". I said ""not right now, maybe later"". He would not return my card to me. I said to him, ""that's my card"", he said, ""no it 's not, this is not your card"", and he folded it in half, destroyed it and threw it in the trash. I was upset with that and said, ""well, now I'm never going to renew it"". His reply was, ""Fine!""",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Think twice & research first!,"EXTREMELY expensive with the TW0 (only) items worth buying in the whole store for me at least is the Kirkland vodka & hearing aides. I spent $120.00 on membership and only got back a whole $7.27 in rewards which I have to drive 30 miles to redeem. Not worth the time & gas! & about their gas price Wal Mart has a 3 cent off card, hard to beat. Originally planned on the higher dollar membership being worthwhile (in rewards) because I purchased hearing aides unfortunately I had to return them because they did not help my type of hearing loss. In a nutshell, I bought 10 bottles on vodka saving six bucks each, equaling $60.00So $120.00 minus 60 savings on vodka recieved $7.27 (rewards) equals waisting $52.73. Alldi's has them beat in quality & is 30 - 50 % less expensive & products come in smaller quantities so no waste! Dollar general offers $5.00 off $25.00 three weeks out of each month equalls big savings. Never ever again will I join nor walk through Costco's doors! I will though, recommend they hearing aides because of price, service and six month return policy.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Tires and Rims,Last night my car was in a slight accident that resulted in 2 bent rims and 2 flat tires. I had to have my car towed to the Costco in Gilbert. They said they could do the tires but the rims I would have to buy. They suggested even to find some in a junkyard. The next day (today) I bought 2 rims at discount and drove them to Costco. They told me they couldn't mix steel rims with aluminum. I then drove to discount and exchanged them for 2 aluminum ones. I took them to Costco and at that point they told me that the rims had to be factory. I was done with them at that point. I wanted to tow my car from there to discount. They said my car would be fine to drive with my broken rims and flat tire. I knew better and didn't choose to do that ridiculous idea. Discount closes at 6 and it was 5:30 so I knew there wouldn't be time to tow it tonight. I will have to continue this mess in the morning. I completely understand that they have certain rules about what rims they can and cannot put on but it sure would have been nice of them to explain that all to me last night so I could've avoided all of this today. Super frustrating Costco!,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Bait and switch,"Be careful, Costco misleads you if you buy a bed from them in several ways — even one of their most expensive beds. They tell you on some choices they will haul away your old bed and set up new one, on other choices they make several claims on the shipping and handling that lead you to believe that they will haul your old bed away saying “contaminated” mattresses will not be hauled away. In the end they call you about setting up saying if you can answer no to be quarantined in the last two weeks or testing positive they can go ahead with the delivery and set up. Then on the day the driver says no set up, porch delivery only and only your mattress can be taken away even though you are replacing your bed with a new foam mattress that does not need box springs. When you call customer service they tell you you don’t qualify for removal or set up with their most expensive mattress because the language does not say that specifically. Then to return it you must haul it in to the store or pay shipping. So much fo 100 % satisfaction guarantee! Go Amazon instead!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Overall I will give Costco 4 stars but…,"Overall I will give Costco 4 stars but no retailer is perfect. They have one of the best return policies around and prices on some items are hard to beat. They rely on membership to make money. I don't like how, like many others are limiting certain items to just one. Yet they allowed companies like Instacart and Shipt to deliver without memberships. The items do cost more but doing an example like their Chicken. They limit to one pack but it is larger than normal of course, but they are a bulk store. But when the allow thousands without membership to buy chicken, and some probably only buy that. Then the members get limited also and that isn't really right. I know its for more money so apparently that is all that matters. I bet if lots started cancelling memberships though it would change. But Kirkland is normally high quality product and like them a lot over Sams. This review site gets mad people and it's over the top with negative reviews mostly. So its not very helpful for the real experience. Plus impossible to please lots of people anyway.",0,4

I called today to find out that the UPS tracking they provided online was not even really a UPS number ( maybe that's why I couldn't locate the replacement). The customer service I spoke with told me it was actually USPS and I tried to track it online while I was on call and I couldn't find the tracking number either. He was insisting I have to wait and it will show up in the mail to which I pointed out that's not possible since they were claiming they shipped out my watch and they can't even give me a clear answer to which courier they used.

Costco Wholesale,Communication about appliance delivery and install awful,"I had purchased a dishwasher on Costco.com.

I had uninstalled the dishwasher according to the instructions, and was all ready for my delivery and install. I waited and waited but never received any phone call confirming the delivery and time frame, so finally, on the eve of delivery, I called up Costoco Concierge to find out what the status was. They then informed me that my delivery and install were not going to happen because they were overbooked, and that I had to reschedule. This was extremely inconvenient for me since I had arranged for my parents to be here when the delivery and install were to take place. They drove 3 hours down to my house to be here for a delivery and install that never happened. I was most upset that I had to be the one who called to find out this information. When were they going to tell me? Apparently never. Morever, I had booked this delivery and install 3 weeks in advance. Why was I the one who ended up getting rescheduled? It's not a fair business practice. Anyway, I ended up taking the next available date which was 2 weeks out. This meant that I was without a dishwasher for the entire 2 weeks, which was another extreme inconvenience. The delivery occurred as scheduled and I did receive a call the night before and the day of. Unfortunately, the install did not follow the same suit. I never heard a peep, and finally on the morning of the installation, I again called up Costco Concierge. They couldn't help me, and made me call up Costco Logistics. They then confirmed the install was going to take place later that day. Again, when were they going to tell me this info? The runaround I got left me very upset. The actual delivery and install teams were great, but the communication from Costco was severely lacking.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Poor treatment of customers,"My review pertains to both an on-line order and my experiences at this location on 1/5/2021:I ordered a Keurig coffee maker, on-line, for a friend recently. When it arrived around 8 PM on 1/4/2021 I noticed that it had been shipped without the usual Costco shipping box. The item I received was beat up, previously opened and had been shipped to another Costco customer (another shipping label was still attached and the invoice sleeve had been opened). When I explained what happened to my friend, we decided to return it to this location.After waiting a few minutes at the customer service area, I was greeted by an arrogant young woman. I could tell that she had a chip on her shoulder from the get go by her body language and facial expression. Not only was she argumentative when I mentioned that this item was shipped to someone else and that the label was still attached to the box, she insulted me when I asked her if my shipping fee would be refunded by telling me that this wasn't New York and that I should calm down, all because I asked her about the shipping charge. We couldn't believe the disrespect and contempt from this woman.Furthermore, while I was shopping I couldn't locate one of the items I wanted and was told to speak with an agent near the checkout area. I approached 2 male agents who were engaged in a conversation. I directed my question to one of them and when he went to look in their computer, the other agent decided to comment on my face mask, claiming that it wasn't up high enough and indicated that either I needed to bring my mask up or purchase a screen.Either these individuals enjoy disrespecting and berating senior citizens or they didn't get enough sleep the night before.Needless to say, I am very disappointed with Costco and their employees and am considering cancelling my membership.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco wilfully contravenes equality laws,"My wife and I visited the Costco warehouse in Sheffield.I am a person who, due to impairment / disability, is exempted under government regulations from wearing a face covering in indoor settings and on public transport. However upon entering the store I was confronted by a member of staff and told that the company’s policy was that customers failing to wear a face-covering were to be refused admission to the store, regardless of the government’s clearly publicised exhortations to traders to be mindful and respectful of circumstances in which customers have approved exemption. Despite my protestations and presenting my exemption card, I was treated boorishly and humiliatingly in being escorted out of the store. This exclusion is an act of gross discrimination against disabled people and, as well as being disrespectful of customers’ circumstances and exhibiting Costco’s ingrained and institutionalized prejudice against people of disability, is a clear breach of the Equality Act 2010. Having been a Costco customer over many years, I am frankly disgusted by their misogynistic hatred and rudeness towards customers whose physical difficulties prevent them from complying with their perverse and unreasonable prejudice. Such a deliberate policy can only be based on a considered disregard for Article 14 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and I therefore had no alternative but to refer their actions to the Equality and Human Rights Commission and, since such mindless contempt for human convention constitutes hate crime, have duly reported the incident to South Yorkshire Police.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Negative experience with delivery of appliances and defective appliances,"I have been a costco member for 15 years. I have never had such a bad experience with Costco until this past year. Received my new dishwasher it leaks. Received my new gas dryer it doesn't dry my clothes. The kitchen cabinets we received were garbage not the quality expected for the $8,000 I spent. If I were to hire a carpenter they would built them all wood. The vendor they deal with is very unprofessional and delivers low quality cabinets. They were not even packaged correctly and damaged during the delivery. My kitchen reno lasted 3 months because twice cabinets were damaged and it took them weeks to deliver them. New appliances that we had to wait weeks don't work now. I have stayed for nearly 3 hours on the phone with costco concierge and they were useless... I have proof and pictures of everything. On top of everything Costco doesn't have a form or email, where customers can file complaints about this unsatisfactory experience. I rely on costco for good customer service and great quality, but have been very disappointed with Costco based on these experiences in the last 16 months. I will update the review once Costco changes and improves work ethic like customers who spend thousands of dollars at this store deserve. Let's not talk about the delivery nightmare service.

If you can be bothered, read on....On 17th Oct 2020, I ordered a Silentnight ottoman divan and mattress set from Costco online. It said 'delivery within 30 business days', I received the bed on 11th December. The divan base that Silentnight dispatched was very damaged (tho the packaging was intact) - runner smashed off drawer, whole ottoman base smashed out and badly wedged back in, tears in the fabric etc. I contacted Costco immediately. I said that I did not want it replaced, as aside from all the damage, it was really badly made - flimsy, staples sticking out, rough sawn timber. I was told that Costco would refund me, and I was sent an email link to book the collection by the courier. I was offered collection dates between mid Jan & mid Feb - I booked mid Feb to give me time to get another bed. My refund did not materialise, and Silentnight apparently cancelled the collection without telling me. To make life easier, I offered to keep the mattress which is fine, and suggested a partial refund of £400 to enable me to order a replacement base, but they wouldn't do that as it was bought as a package. My option was accept a £75 'goodwill gesture' (such an insult!) to keep the pile of junk, or return the whole bed for a full refund (meanwhile I have to find another £1000 to purchase a replacement from elsewhere, or go without a bed at all for several weeks until I get the refund and get another one ordered).I won't be ordering from Costco or Silentnight again.",0,1

Please do not waste your time buying electronics and appliances at Costco and their extended warranty fraud.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Average store,"Average store, it sucks that it has to close on almost every single holiday. Costco is like a supermarket, same for Safeway and Lucky, but both Safeway and Lucky open on holidays, because people need food, but i don't why they close Costco? Costco gasoline is great cause it's cheaper than other Gasoline like Shell and 76. Costumer Service sucks badly, they are mostly very dum and strict. Cashiers are sometimes bad also. The good is that they have samples, but sometimes you have to wait for a long time and people steal them quick. Costco roasted chicken, is okay, if you want to get one, you usually might have to wait, the size of the people may be a problem if you have a big family. Parking can be a problem, if the Costco you go to is popular.",0,3

Costco Wholesale,Costco appliances - 2nd delivery failure,"2nd delivery failure - 2 weeks ago Costco was to deliver our washer/dryer units on 12/16. Received multiple email/call reminders regarding the appointment. But they were a no show. After a lengthy customer service call I found they did not even have the appliances at the distribution center. No explanation as to why the delivery was scheduled or no one let me know. No apology for my wasted time. Rescheduled to today - again, multiple calls/emails for a reminder of the 8-10:00 delivery this morning. A live phone call received at 7:30 this morning confirming ""we will be there shortly"". At 10:15 I started calling for status. 45 minutes into the call I was told ""the dryer only was in the warehouse and not the washer, so we pulled the dryer off the truck"". Again, NO explanation on why someone couldn't call, why the delivery was confirmed, and no certain timing on the washer making it from where it is apparently sitting (about 90 miles away) to the local distribution. I was to be transferred to a supervisor - and we were ""cut off"". I called back in, and now have been on hold 27 minutes and counting for a supervisor. This is the most unacceptable delivery experience I've ever had. The lack of communication, miscommunication and poor customer service is appalling.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Delivery Issues,"In October 2020, I ordered a LG Styler from Costco online. When the delivery men came to our house and unboxed the item and we saw the dents on each side of the edge and they just left without showing any indifference on their face. So we took a picture of the dents on LG styler and called the Costco customer service and they sound like they didn't even care if it was damaged or not. They have such horrible customer service. Plus in December.. We tried another delivery from Costco online. But it was terrible again!! They called in the morning saying it would be delivered on 12/28 between 4pm ~ 6 pm, but the delivery men didn't even come. So we called the customer service the next day, they said our LG UHD 75"" TV disappeared while it was delivering. What?? How's that happening? and they gave us a call in the morning for a reminder as well?? So I spoke to a lady named ""Tina from the logistics team and she was very unfriendly too. She didn't even care if it was on time or not. I was not going to post any reviews for the above cases... But this is just unbelievable. I don't know how a company like Costco is doing their online business like this!!!??? So I recommend everyone just not purchase any expensive products from Costco online.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,My prayer was answered. 🙏,"I love Costco's, products. They have unique items that you cannot find at other stores, and the items are not damaged. This year, I end up having three mini, refrigerators, from other stores, in two months. Some of the packaging of the boxes, were in bad shape, that we're delivered to my home, and some appeared as if, they were new, but that,wasn't, the case. They were used refrigerators, brought back to the store, and package as new refrigerators. I had a membership at Costco's before, so a friend of mine, told me that Costco, sells, mini refrigerator. So I took the chance, and renew my membership. I went in the store, just to look around, and I found two new mini refrigerators, I prayed that this fourth, refrigerator is brand new, because each time, I buy a refrigerator, I have to take it up a flight of stairs and it is so heavy, and each time, when it broke down, I had to bring it down stairs, put it in my vehicle, and put it in the basket, and take it back to the store. I needed, the mini refrigerator, because I have to have, major surgery, and I can't do the up and down, stairs. I was so happy, that the refrigerator was brand new, in the pack never used, and it's working just fine. Thank you Costco 🎉🎊💕",0,5
Costco Wholesale,Mask Nazis,"Mask Nazis. I was treated like a criminal for not wearing a mask at the Churchill Way warehouse in Dallas, TX. The employee who confronted me was clearly on a power trip and followed me throughout the store to ""ensure"" I didn't take the mask off. I was livid. As a result, I have cancelled my membership (after having been a member for 13 years), and told the service rep why. In addition, I wrote a letter to the corporate office and the local store manager. I would encourage others to do the same. This is way out of hand and Costco should be ashamed of themselves.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Bought a dishwasher from Costco on…,"Bought a dishwasher from Costco on 12/2/2020 and got the delivery on 12/19. Then comes the most disappointing experience. They promised and scheduled installation on the 12/19/2020 between 2 and 5 PM. No show or call for missing the installation. So, I called Costco on 12/19 after waiting all day; after 30 minutes on the phone someone answered. Explained the situation; service rep asked me to call the installer and gave me the number to call. I asked him why could he not call. He said it's between installer and me though I told him over and over that I made the purchase from Costco and expect costco to oversee the entire process of delivery and install. With his insistence, I called Hayes (installer) many times as I was getting only answering machine. Left many messages; called Costco back to let them know. No result; so I called Hays again and finally got a hold of someone 3 days later only to be told by the installer that I need to get with costco to re-schedule the delivery of installation kit. I did that and installation kit was scheduled to deliver on 12/26 between 11 and 2 pm. Again no show for the delivery. So I called costco again and this time they are telling me costco made a mistake with the date; instead of scheduling 12/26 they scheduled 12/25 which is why I did not receive delivery. Now they are scheduling again for 12/28 for delivery of install kit and install. I have ZERO confidence if this time it will be done. I would just caution everyone that COSTCO unfortunately is providing horrible services and stay away from ordering online particularly appliances. Worst of all is the attitude that they make you feel like they are doing you a favor by calling the installer. Very bad customer experience I must say. I have been a costco executive business member for over 10 years and this is not what one should expect.",0,1

When I didn't get an email in 2 days I called, and they said one item was being refunded, and the other items would be reshipped after they finished their investigation into why it went to the wrong address, about 5 more days.

Costco Wholesale,"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, COSTCO!","I ordered Home Wine Bar (not on sale). I was told it would arrive 3 weeks later. 2-3 days before the delivery date, I called Costco Online (since I didn't receive any information on it) I spoke with a person ""Annaley"" and was told that my product would be delivery on time for me and that they do not email anything except for only they've delivered the product. Not on the date my product should be delivered, they sent out an order delay email FOR A WHOLE MONTH. I called them again to ask why? Normal when something is delayed, it should only be a few days or a week, this delay is longer than the wait for the initial order. The call took over 1 hour thirty minutes and the two representatives still couldn't help me instead, I was spoken to in a disrespectful tone and impolitely response when ask for the explanation why is it delayed for so long. First I spoke to ""Nisha"", who wasn't being informative on why my order is delayed and just rudely said "" right now we don't have the product do you just want keep the order or cancel it?"". There was no apology whatsoever coming from this lady but just that ""now we don't have the product do you just want keep the order or cancel it?"" when they're the one that at fault. I pay my membership with Costco, I shop with Costco, it is Costco's fault if they do not have the product for me. Annoyed with that, I asked to speak with a Manager instead and I spoke with ""Joseph"" but I doubt he's the manager because with the way he also talked with me, I do not see the different in the professionalism between him and Nisha. I asked for the reason why my order and all I got back was ""less trucks blah blah blah and coronavirus and what else could it be"", that ""what else could it be"" is like ""oh you know we have coronavirus, that's why it is delayed you stupid"" which was very unnecessary, when I confronted him, he denied, but hey COSTCO, your calls are monitored and recorded, so take a look in it and train your employees properly, even if he's truly is a manager, I'm 100% sure there's other people higher than him, so take actions! This experience was unacceptable, I've been a customer since 2010 and have always been an executive member. Even an executive member gets treated like that, I'm sad how worse other customers are being treated. I hope these two employees the 'delinquent ones' and other employees are nicer and actually helpful. Don't think just because you work in a large company you can act like you don't need customers. Next time you speak to your customers, treat them like how you treat your boss, putting effort in to get promoted = putting effort in to help customers. Again so UNACCEPTABLE! I'd give this a zero star. You should train your employees better and maybe only promote people when you assess their service skills carefully and not through favoritism and nepotism. I know your managers are better than those two people because being a 10 years customers, I've spoken with so many employees and managers, they're much, much better than the people I spoke with today. Costco is not selling anything special that I cannot buy from other places, I do not depend on COSTCO, but I think COSTCO depends on customers, especially loyal customers like me, 10 YEARS. This is my experience with COSTCO today and that was my feedback. I hope something like today does not happen again COSTCO and I hope COSTCO do take action and train these people again!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,I wish I could give 0 starts,"I wish I could give 0 starts. This has been the absolute worst online shopping experience of my life. They keep canceling the orders because they can't verify my address. In oakland california. And after 4 hours on the phone with them, they are saying it is because the system can't verify my name as being associated with the address. What does that even mean? I bought the house a week ago, but that's besides the point - what do they care what name they can see on public records for verifying an address? If I want to pay for something to be shipped to an address, that should be more than enough. And at minimum a supervisor should be able to override the they awful system. I'm not a person that writes reviews, ever, but this put me over the top. NEVER USE COSTCO.COM",0,1

The customer service was awful and no information given on a shipping date, or anything else except shipping problems . I worked at UPS and I can tell that if it’s in there end I would be talking to them about a tracking number or lost package. She said it has not shipped yet due to shipping delays . That is not factual and not a answer someone is looking for and zero follow up on when to expect the order . So I cancelled over the conversation going nowhere fast . I asked for a supervisor and got the response I am waiting for one . So I got no confirmation we talked or any confirmation my order was cancelled . I ordered this on the 6 of December and not even shipped that’s really odd. Please follow up the cancellation so I can get my cards in person before Christmas. I love the Costco store , but your online customer service ranks lower than the airlines and no , zero follow up .

Costco Wholesale,Ordered a laptop from Costco on Dec,"Ordered a laptop from Costco on Dec. 4, 2020. The order was canceled the same day by Costco. I discovered the cancellation on Dec. 6 and I called Costco and asked why they canceled it. They said they assumed it was a fraud since the laptop was going to one of their warehouses and not to my home address (an option anyone can choose). They then extensively cross-examined me to be sure I am their member and that, in fact, I wanted it to be delivered to a warehouse instead of my home (I'm working in Kauai for 2 months). They then agreed to process the order and I paid for 2 day delivery. 4 days later, Dec. 10, the order has not been delivered. I made various calls to Costco and they said they are busy each time and things are getting delayed and that the laptop will be shipped from their distribution center in Tracy, CA. They gave me a UPS tracking number. I called UPS several times over several days, and they stated that a “label had been created by Costco, but Costco has not shipped the item to UPS yet.” I said I would assume UPS would PICK UP the delivery, and that Costco would not be shipping it to UPS! Exasperated, I called the Costco distribution center in Tracy today (Dec. 10) and talked to a very helpful Costco employee, Devon, who assured me he would put it on the truck to UPS today. Not happy with Costco's performance.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco and Lenovo 2 thumbs down,Normally I love Costco but for the first time in 15 years they have disappointed me. Bought a 1500. Laptop said it came with a 2 year warranty. Never was offered or new about a parts warranty. Laptop w key broke in 6 months. Lenovo fixed it( not really was always loose still) 9 months later w key is broke. Lenovo says not their problem and so does Costco. My 2 warranty doesn't cover key boards. You should've bought the damage warranty that I didn't even know about and wasn't offered. Will not buy electronics from either place. So sick of corporate dishonest greed.,0,1

They seem to just want you to purchase, but provide no resolution or explanation for any issues. Wanting you to purchase items also explains why they do not provide listings of what is in each store aisle.

All this is happening while their hypocritical staff behind the Customer's Service counter are whispering in each other's ears and are milling about as normal, not even 2-ft apart, let alone 6!Finally, after every trip there became an arduous and extremely unpleasant experience, we had had enough. I went in today to cancel my membership after having been a customer for over twenty years. They never batted an eye or offered an apology! They just threatened me some more about loss of points etc.Of course, they feel entitled to do whatever the heck they please, now that out governments have deemed them ""essential"" while closing down the mom-and-pop shops, driving them into bankruptcy. I am foregoing the points accrued, which Costco is now stealing from me, openly, but at least, I am keeping my self-respect!The Customer used to be King, but not after our corrupt governments have given the big corporations an opportunity to act with impunity with clients, all to push millions to online shopping!

The next day I called their so called customer service who could not given me any answers. I waited and waited until 12/5 and finally decided to try and manually reschedule delivery.

So I waited the whole day and night for it as when I called customer service, they said delivery was done until 9 pm. But in the end, it never came. When I called the next day, the reason stated was the item did not reach the warehouse in time to be transferred to the logistic truck. But why the status said, on transit then? And the promised delivery time now was stated 5 days later. We'll see if the tv is going to be delivered then. But I lost trust with Costco logistics system already.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Costco Fraud Deceitful delivery dates for TV,Costco has deceived people buying on Thanksgiving promising delivery that was never expected to be met. I ordered this TV on Nov 26 with a guaranteed delivery date of Nov 30. I stayed home all day for the delivery and it did not arrive. I called up Costco and they said it will not arrive today but will be delivered latest by Saturday. I call up again in the week to check and they say it has not even been shipped out and may happen on Friday. Call up Friday and they state maybe by Monday or call us. This has been an incredibly frustrating experience. I have no idea when it is going to be delivered. I had wanted the TV delivered quickly and placed it via Costco due to the delivery dates and being an Executive member. Other retailers were offering the same price and quick delivery in 2 days. I really feel Costco deliberately deceived people online with the delivery dates as no one would have placed an order with them if the delivery dates are 2 weeks out compared to 2 days with other retailers. The price of the TV went up after Monday in all stores so cannot even cancel and get it delivered from another retailer. Very frustrated and still waiting with no clue as to when my TV will arrive.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Customer service is horrible,"I received a reward check in September 2020. Not knowing why, I called customer service. After about a 25 min wait, I was connected. I was advised that my husband upgraded my account. I advised rep that I was the primary member and he had no authorization to change my account. She said she would downgrade it. Talked to my husband and he did not remember upgrading. He said he was just replacing his card and just wanted to get out of there. A few weeks later, I tried to pay my membership fee online and account still showed upgraded. Called customer service again and waited 20-30 mins. I was told that their records showed the downgrade. Said she would fix it. A few weeks later, still not fixed. This time I chatted online due to long wait on phone. Once again was told would be fixed. Tried to renew again today and still not fixed. Chatted online. This time I was told there were no notes on my account that I had ever called except to renew my membership. Told her there should be copious notes because this was my fourth time contacting them. She said she only showed that I had paid $15 to upgrade. Told her I never upgraded. Said she would talk to her supervisor to fix it. A few hours later I went into account to renew. The downgrade was there. However, I still could not renew because my only option after inputting my info was to upgrade. I am so frustrated. Been a member since 1988 and have never had to go through this to renew. Now I have to try and renew in store. I really did not want to spend extra time in store with COVID-19. Why is it so difficult to downgrade my account to the same membership I’ve had since 1988. This is not a good time for this to occur.",0,1

Furious because of the plans made around it but agreed because it was the only date they had someone available to install. Well, we got our delivery and they installed the stove (it's electric so no effort there) but they didn't do the microwave. Someone was supposed to come later to install that.

Costco Wholesale,A couple thoughts I have,A couple thoughts I have: Add more checkouts. Stores are very good about staffing the register but more registers are needed in every store I have been in. Give customers the option of self check outs. I’m single and also maintain a Sams Club membership due to the fact that some of the quantities you have to buy are too much for a single person. An example is the fresh fruits and vegetables. You carry an item for 6 months or so. We grow to love it and then it’s gone. Never to be seen again. Maybe you could move items to online sales after you take them out of stores. Acai berry yogurt is good but why did you remove the chocolate? Buy larger dispensing machines so you can bring back the chocolate yogurt at the lunch counter.,0,4

Costco Wholesale,I'm One Disappointment Away From Cancelling This Membership!,"I'd like to say it is strictly the San Francisco location, but it's actually many of the stores. The quality is going down the drain, and they have the staff to disappoint you even further. See Google for my posting about the time that I was accused of ""trying to have a free I-TEM"" in a nearly empty cart instead of the receipt checker/woman saying ""Looks like your cashier failed to scan the milk"" (which wasn't /nor could be hidden in a cart with a few baskets of fruit and some milk).I went in today, and was excited to see they had a few Netgear wireless modems in stock. It struck me as odd that the item wasn't sealed in plastic, but none of the boxes were, so I placed it in my cart and moved on. I even had a nagging voice telling me to check the device before leaving the store, but I didn't. Boy do I regret it! I opened the box once I returned home, and NOTHING was packaged inside the box. The manual and paperwork were bent and wrinkled. There was gray hair, cat hair, dust/dirt, and carpet fibers on the modem. Once I repacked the box, I realized there was already a return sticker (that they usually give you upon returning an item to the store) on the side of the box with the number 16 on it. These people sold me a returned modem!I called customer careLESS, and the woman told me to ""return it soon so they'll know [I'm] not trying to run a scam"". How TF can I make anything as filthy as the modem was when I opened it (in less than an hour)? They have access to EVERYTHING anyone has ever purchased, and she tried to imply that they might reject the return if I wait a few days. I had to remind her that my account will show that I've never owned the item in all of the years that I have been shopping with Costco. I had to drag my child back to the store after having returned home and showered from the trip an hour earlier. This place needs to get their act together.

Costco Wholesale,Mattress dumped on my front step when I was gone…,"Costco was not able to deliver my order on the scheduled day. They called to say that and give a new date in a message.I returned the call, waited a long time exceeding 15 minutes on hold to say that I cannot just be home all day. I am a teacher at a school. They said to call back AFTER my deliver time was given. I get a recorded call with an AM delivery window. I called back. I have been on hold OVER 40 minutes. Do you have any idea how busy teachers are at this point?? In the end, the Costco delivery service came when I was at work, left the mattress to sit all day on my front step, and did not take my old mattress or box spring, though I paid for this service. It took my NY son on the phone with numerous people over a period of 2 days to sort this out, and my local son to get the mattress in the house. In the end a very kind man resolved this, but this was a terrible, time consuming experience. The delivery service has no acceptable way to communicate, and it appears to be a dump and run service rather than delivering an expensive item properly.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Very Poor Customer Service!,"We have ordered from Costco.com for years and the parcels were always delivered to our private mailbox box. IT IS NOT A P.O. BOX! We live in a rural area with limited mail delivery by USPS. Now wouldn't you think that all of a sudden Costco can not deliver to that same mailbox anymore because their policy has supposedly changed and only deliver to residential addresses. So we can not get any deliveries from Costco online. So where does this leave people like us in a time like this when you are supposed to shelter in place? Truthfully this is the dummest thing I have ever heard of. We get all our mail and deliveries there whether it is UPS, FEDEX, USPS or other packages....go figure. My husband was practically on the phone, mostly on hold, for 2 hours to straighten this issue out however to no avail. Poor customer service!",0,1

After 8 hours on hold they are now missing two parts and want to deliver within an 8 hour time period on Saturday, wasting a full day of our time.

She left a message for me that I should return my old phone to the store. When I went back a few days later, different people were there and said no, I have to turn my phone in to Verizon. When I was about to leave, This salesperson said, are you Lisa? I said yes. Then she said there was a price change on the new phone while it was out on order (which I already had, paid for and was processed). I was questioning her, but she was very evasive. She asked me for my phone number. She had her headset on and was speaking to other people. She totally ignored me and didn’t explain what was going on, only to ask me to put my PIN number in my phone, etcetera. I was there for a full hour. After she was done she tells me they’re not going to charge me the reactivation fee of $40. What?????????? I said what is the problem? Oh, the original salesperson undercharged me so they had to adjust it back into their favor. They screwed up, lied to me to have me come back in the store, be evasive regarding the mistake, wasted my time. They should have ate their mistake.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,I went to Costco in Riverdale/Ogden…,"I went to Costco in Riverdale/Ogden Utah after googling their hours and seeing 9:30-8:00 I get there and the door greeter says I can’t go in because they’re only open for seniors right now (which I was fine with) I simply said when I looked online it said 9:30 so I didn’t know, he said “well I’ve heard that a lot today so I’ll have to check with management. I was only telling him it says that so he was aware of it, as there were a handful of other people there that also thought they could shop at 9:30. I stepped back a good 10 ft with the others so the seniors could go in and I was going to wait. A few minutes later he comes up to me and says “Did you read the sign?” I said no I just googled the hours and drove down. He replies with “Why don’t you step outside and read the sign!” Incredibly rude. I simply let him know why me and a handful of other people thought we could shop and stepped back with them to wait there was no reason for him to come back out to me and act like that. I then go to Sam’s and call the Manager at that Costco to let him know and first he cut me off and said if I would have went to their website and not googled it I would’ve had correct information. I told him waiting to go in wasn’t my point and had he let me finish talking he would know that, he half heartedly apologized and so I explained what happened and he says “Again I apologize but we can’t control google!” I clarified my point was his employee didn’t need to come at me in that way or at all, I didn’t make a scene or anything and I had already moved to wait with the others, I don’t pay to shop somewhere to be treated like crap. He says “Do you know who it was?” I said no that’s not my job to know who you’ve scheduled at the door. It was an older guy with black and a little gray hair. He says very condescendingly “ Again sorry” they obviously don’t care about their customers so you’re better off going to Sam’s even though the quality at Costco is better, Sam’s doesn’t come back at the member to be a dick when there was no scene made or reason for escalation. The decision to cancel my membership would have been made on the spot while at the store except I’m not the only one on the account so I needed to speak with her. I’ve been with Costco for so many years they received so much patronage from me not just in the store but I stopped buying car batteries and tires from other places as well. They could’ve simply just said thanks for letting me know the internet is providing false information or even just left it alone when I backed up to wait. The manager could’ve not cut me off assuming my problem was waiting to enter and let me finish a sentence he could have also sounded like he was listening in the first place and sounded genuine in is apology. I wasn’t seeking any special treatment I simply had wrong information from the internet and for that was boarder line verbally attacked by an employee and their Management in front of multiple customers also waiting who had looks of astonishment at how the door greeter came at me. One of them also left when I did, I am to assume because of that, because prior to that he told his wife we’ll just wait it’s not that long.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,DO NOT ORDER APPLIANCES FROM COSTCO.COM,"I've been a member of Costco now for over 12 years and up until recently have not had a bad thing to say about them. This is one of the reasons why I'm so disappointed with my latest experience. In September of 2020 I purchased a washer and dryer from Costco.com. My order summary email stated that the washer/dryer would be delivered on Oct 20. By October 18th I had not received any other communication from Costco so I logged on to my account online and it still showed delivery scheduled for Oct 20. In order to make room for the new units I sold my old ones on Oct 19. At approx noon on Oct 20 (scheduled delivery date) I called Costco customer service and asked when I could expect it. Their answer...November 30! I explained to the customer service rep and several ""supervisors"" that this simply was not an option. I have a family of 4 so going 40 days without a washer/dryer is an impossibility. The final supervisor (Gary) told me that he would call the manufacturer to see if anything could be expedited and that he would let me know within 24 hours - by end of day Oct 21. I didn't hear from him until Nov 5 when he emailed me to say that the units would not be in their warehouse until Nov 23.I ended up in a mad scamble finding the units at Best Buy available for delivery on Oct 31 for $631 more than I paid for them at Costco. When I cancelled the order at Costco and suggested that they offer me an instore credit for the difference they told me that the could/would not offer a credit on a cancelled order. At no point in any of this process did they offer any real help or make any effort to smooth over the issue. They don't seem to have any idea how to deliver on their brand promise with online orders. I could not be more disappointed in how they handled it and plan to dramatically reduce my business with them.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Costco needs to train their employees better.,"Costco needs to train their employees better. Today I was shopping with my mother and came across Clorox Wipes which clearly stated one per membership. Since we both have separate memberships we each got one. We got on line and when we were one person from register I noticed several openings on the self check out line, so I took my Clorox Wipes and went through the self check out. I then waited for my mother to complete her check out. The woman behind the register refused to ring up her Clorox Wipes, because she saw us together. After arguing with my mother that we could only buy one per group, she screamed for the manager who said if they have separate memberships it was perfectly ok. The clerk then started arguing with the manager. By the time we got out of the store we were a bit upset and un nerved. So much so that we never noticed that the two woman behind the register never place a pair of jeans my mother purchased, into the cart. Unfortunately the person at the door as you leave did not pick it up. I know the cart was completely empty when loaded the car. We never picked up on the missing item till later in the evening.The main point is the casher was rude and belittling to my mother who did nothing wrong. This person should not be employed in any position that requires interaction with the public. Also do not rely on the people at the door to catch every mistake.",0,1

I said no they will not, they are too close to me and they are not 6ft away. So, she said she would do it then. I was shocked she was less than a foot away from me. Costco has plastic barriers and expects customers to wear masks and be 6ft apart. Apparently in real life that does not apply. Now I am not sure if the cashiers have to do # of ring ups within x number of hours. I do not care.This disturbs me so much; I will be going to the Seattle Times over this. Especially with the media coverage of Costco making customers adhere to safety standards.1. Submitted business violation. I am pretty sure that this is not the only Costco doing this.",0,2
Costco Wholesale,Terrible delivery process for fridge,"I'm a frequent shopper at Costco, but I had never bought their appliances before this experience. I ordered a fridge and it was delivered nearly a month after the initial promised delivery date, after multiple delays. The first delay was caused by the contractors refusing the remove the door off the fridge to be able to carry it through the hallway. This is standard procedure, which I was told by friends who live in the same complex who had 0 issues with their fridge delivery from a different company, so I am led to believe that the contractors hired (JB Hunt) were willfully lazy in my delivery process. The second time, I received no phone call and no delivery cancellation notice and I waited the whole day for a fridge that never came. The third time, I finally received my fridge. Each time I rescheduled I was put on hold for up to 3 hours, for a total of around 6 hours of being on hold, waiting for a response on what had happened to my delivery. This was a total mishandling on the part of the contractors as well as Costco itself. This fridge was nearly $2000 and we were stuck without a place to store food for nearly a month, which meant we had to eat out every. single. day. So wasteful, and in a time of COVID-19 when money is pretty tight in the house. It was so much unnecessary stress and I'm still fuming with how the supervisor handled it. Never again. I'll buy my appliances from a smaller company that cares more about customer service next time.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Dishwasher Installation - No Care for Disabled Person’s Safety,"We took delivery of a dishwasher this morning, & despite having paid for installation the delivery men from “2 Man Delivery” (the company contracted by Costco for delivery) refused to install it because it wasn’t included on their paperwork. We even showed them our receipt to demonstrate we had paid for it, but they said there was nothing they could do. We immediately called Costco & were promised a return phone call, which never materialised. We have called a further two times to get this matter rectified, but are no closer to a solution. On top of this, my dad has Parkinson’s & the dishwasher is sitting in the middle of the kitchen, acting as a huge trip and fall and safety hazard. He is currently unable to go into the kitchen for fear of falling & seriously injuring himself. When asked about Costco’s liability should he fall & injure himself or damage the dishwasher, there was no answer. Costco do not seem to understand the urgency with which we need this sorted & the fact they are completely disregarding a disabled person’s safety and accessibility in their own home. We paid for delivery and installation to be completed at the same time to limit the impact it had on the household. Furthermore, we are shielding & being incredibly cautious because of COVID-19 as my dad is a vulnerable person & it now means more people will have to come into the house to rectify the issue, which is something we are severely limiting. We are now awaiting a further return call, but are not expecting anything to happen owing to it being mid-afternoon on a Friday & so will be left with a dishwasher in the middle of the kitchen until at least next week & my dad unable to use the kitchen. We are so disappointed & angry that this has happened, & that Costco do not seem to be concerned enough with the predicament they have left us in to be able to quickly rectify the matter. We have asked for Head Office’s phone number to take this matter further, but Costco are claiming there is no phone number for employees in the customer service department to ring & they have to email them themselves.",0,1

I asked him if I was supposed to leave them in the car where they could die while I shopped? I live an hour away in Pueblo CO and my one dog has cancer appointments in Colorado Springs where they are. I can't come without her at this point. He said I would have to make that choice to put my dog at risk or not shop at their store. I chose not to shop at their store. I complained the next time to Hannah who is in charge of the managers. She said that was the rule. I suggested they have an area fenced with the old fashioned horse posts where one employee could monitor the area where the dogs were tied up safely and watched so no one would steal them.

I've been going to the Buford GA. store for a long time! I miss the friendly staff! Today while shopping, I saw a food sampling cart. It was something like egg rolls. I approached it from the side and asked the young man for a sample. His response was: Hey lady what's your problem? Can't you read? Needless to say I was taken aback! Turns out they were fake egg rolls. Evidently there was a small sign posted IF you approached it from the front you MIGHT be able to read! I was shocked needless to say! As I was looking at an item in the freezer case a little further down I couldn't help (I believe he wanted me to) hear the same salesperson greet another person and loudly comment about it would be a good day if only people would learn to read. For what it's worth there were other sampling carts with real samples to try. Didn't bother! Several months ago I had encounter with a cashier who yelled at me that I shouldn't cut in line! She continued to berate me the whole time she was ringing up my purchase. I didn't cut in line! It was one of those situations where my cart and another cart met at the exact same moment and the gentleman (a Frenchman) politely gestured for me to go ahead. He was so shocked at her behavior he tried to get her to stop talking to me like that! I left in tears! Called cooperate and local when I got home! The cashier is still there!

However, to my surprise, I received an email from Costco on the 15th October, informing me that my order was canceled by Costco, with the following remarks :-Credit Card or Payment informationBilling and/or Shipping informationI called Costco Customer care number, and was told by the CSR that my order was canceled because my billing zipcode did not match with that of the credit card account I used. I repeatedly told the CSR that it was one and the same and there was no change, and probably there was a system error on Costco side. For over half an hour, the CSR was discussing with her team and keeping my call on hold on and off. After half an hour of being on the call, the CSR told me that I had to answer 3 questions for verification. I answered the first two satisfactorily but the third question was expecting me to provide details of recent purchaees done in my recent visit to a Costco store. I was driving for the doctor's appointment by then, and it was absolutely inconvenient to ask such verification question, so I informed the CSR accordingly and wanted to talk to her supervisor. Eventually, I was on hold for another 20 minutes while driving, and the CSR once or twice told me that she was connecting me to the Supervisor, but anyway she was emphasizing that I would need to answer the same verification questions to the supervisor also. It was almost one hour if my telephone call and I had to go inside the doctor's office, so I had to disconnect the call. No one bothered to call me back. Please note that I had called the Costco customer service because the deal was over on the previous day, and I wouldn't have gotten the discount with a fresh order. I think Costco could have verified the billing zip code with the credit card company once again, but they didn't. The CSR was also very rude and did not understand that the value of customer's time and how the customer can keep patience for 1 hour over something which Costco could have taken care of within a fraction of time spent by me in the phone. Overall, it was a terrible experience. Not going to call Costco customer service again.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco Appliances,Never buy appliances at Costco.com. They outsource delivery/installation to a company who basically sends truckers to install.

Costco Wholesale,Don't order from Costco.com,I've enjoyed and valued shopping at Costco Warehouses for the last 15 years. The customer experience from Costco.com or costco customer services is abysmal. They won't take emails - stating they want to help you in 'real time' - but have a 61 minute hold time only to get disconnected. Our Samsung refrigerator was ordered May 25 - no information for delivery until July 7 - from the delivery company. Delivered with a dent. And for 3 months we've tried to contact COSTCO for some resolution. I won't EVER do this again!!,0,1

Costco Wholesale,Buying from Costco right now after…,"Buying from Costco right now after Covid-19 started is a real nightmare ! I bought a package of appliances online on 07/25/20, the approximate delivery date was 08/08/20, we passed this date and on 8/16 I contacted Costco.com after I spent 85 minutes on hold ! All what they told me was only another promise that I will get another email from them with the new delivery date ! On August 19 I got email says the new approximate day will be on 08/25 , the same situation they didn’t even bother to contact me after we passed 8/25!! I went to Costco local store in my city on 08/30/20 and talked to the manager who called them and spent over 45 minutes on hold without any success to do anything other than just another promise ( lie ) that they will contact me back with the next few days with a new delivery date! It’s like they are telling you indirectly we lied to you and we don’t have, or we can’t get the appliances for you so go ahead and cancel your order. On 8/31 I preferred everything separately and not as a package but the same brand for all ( Samsung), I ordered the Fregirator from Sam’s club who promised delivery on 09/16 and got it on the same day the promised, stupid me I did the same mistake and ordered the other appliances again from Costco.com thinking they might get better now, they gave me the approximate delivery date 09/14/20 which never happened, then after I called them they sent me another stupid email ( 09/18/20) like the other before with new delivery on 10/05/20, Today is 10/09/20 and they didn’t and don’t even bother to contact me back and explain what’s happening again and again, my advise keep far-away from Costco.com because they are not trustworthy any more !",0,1
Costco Wholesale,I purchased a hot tub in April it…,"I purchased a hot tub in April it finally arrived after I had to call multiple times to the manufacture and delivery company itself that said it must’ve been forgotten it is still sitting in the stockyard somewhere on the East Coast it finally arrived July 2 damaged and didn’t work never once did I get an email or a phone call response or talk to a human from evolution spas which is the company of the hot tub I bought through Costco that they still sell online to this day. Even Costco’s customer service put me on hold I got hung up on after multiple phone calls and countless wasted hours on hold or waiting for a call back, when I was finally able to reach Costco representative who tried calling the company and got hung up on themselves I was basically told there’s nothing they could do after months of patients and zero customer service I requested a refund on my hot tub which Costco eventually did do, I was set up with air Vans a moving company in Boise Idaho that was supposed to come and pick up my hot tub, again it arrived damaged and broken, That I paid professional hot tub movers to take from the curbside to my back porch when Air vans arrived they informed me they could not take it off of my back porch and that It had to be curbside .... that is not what air vans told me when the appointment was made EVEN THOUGH I addressed this issue with their representative when I made the appointment, NOW BOTH air vans and Costco Are telling me that I must pay that same professional hot tub moving company to move it back to my curbside before they’ll remove it. After countless hours on hold and ULTIMATE frustration I will be charged for fees for a third party moving company to get this eye sore piece of junk off of MY back porch before ANYONE is willing to help me!!! I am so incredibly disappointed with Costco, Air Vans moving company in Boise Idaho and ultimately evolution spas! Do not purchase from costco.com but especially do not purchase a hot tub because once they get your money oh you can eventually get it back after months of your wasted time and frustration with deplorable customer service. My advice is spend a little more and by local I guess because this online world that we live in doesn’t care about customer service they only care about getting your money!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Rude customer service- and not the first time.,"I've shopped many times at the Cedar park 183A -branch and since I am covered, I have always tried to ignore the looks I get. It's as if I have two heads or three eyes....Anyways I have never bought ice cream sundae or pizza so I told the lady there what I wanted. She was supposed to be 'trained' to offer her services to me but instead she was looking at me like I was some kind of freak because I hadn't paid for it first. She kept looking at my hands for the receipt apparently but obviously I didn't have it because I didn't know! I thought the payment was done there with her. She just kept on rolling her eyes and mumbling something under her mask until I had to figure it out. How would it hurt to just tell me to pay at the payment stall first? I wish she and her manager read my review and do something to correct this rude attitude.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Avoid this pharmacy at all costs,"Avoid this pharmacy at all costs. First, like most pharmacies, they are grossly understaffed while they peddle their drugs. 2nd, rerouting you in line two or three times is evidently what a PharmD goes to school for; 3rd, administering a basic flu-shot is too much for this pharmacy team. I got so tired of dealing with my first time ever' exp with Costco pharmacy, their loud, overworked one rude staff member, I canceled my 9-year membership with Costco that visit. I left a $300 cart full of their crap on my way out. I should have known better.. Medication is not their strong suit. The employee was the ONLY one working like a tank while Pharmacists stared at the long line doing absolutely nothing other than directing us to her. I wasted two hours at this store being rerouted by pharmacy over a $19.99 flu shot (that I still didn't get) and a rude clerk that was overworked. No thank you.

It is on my credit card bill, now they are refusing my delivey and refusing to refund my money. I'm at a loss for words! When I called costco they said it was the manufacturer who put the hold on it and there is nothing they can do. What?? You have over $2000 from me and I don't have my patio set. Go into the store and buy, don't buy online!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco is OK ish,"Costco is OK ish, and only for the prices. Amidst this pandemic everyone else is offering curbside delivery while Costco not only refuses that but they mark up their food online or via food delivery services such as instacart. Kind of defeats the point of having a Costco membership when there is no safe way to get anything and if you do get anything the prices are more similar to any other market. Plus I ordered a shed about a month ago and for the longest eternity of a time the website stated ""order received"" then it was shipped two days ago but said it would be here in 4 days and they'd call ahead. OK great. Except the guy just delivered it 4 days early and they did not call and since it's freight they expect you to be home and available. He is very lucky we were. Because the only call I got was ""I'm here with your Costco delivery."" Seriously? Costco uses ghetto freight.",0,2
Costco Wholesale,This service has been useless,"This service has been useless. We bought a suite of LG appliances on 04/03/2019 for $5799.00 consisting of a refrigerator, microwave, oven/range, dishwasher and began having issues immediately. The first issues were with the installation. Costco's ""white glove service"" that includes the delivery and install is also useless. The plastic protective film was left on on many areas and was not easy to get off. They were supposed to do it, not me. The microwave was installed incorrectly, it has 4 grease filters for the built in range hood but they only installed 2 of them and handed me the other 2 and told me they were extras. After using the range hood for a few weeks (and I cook a lot) something wasn't seeming right so I examined the range hood closely and noticed 2 gaping holes in the back that are not easily seen. These holes are where the ""extra"" 2 filters were supposed to have been installed and they were indeed not extra. They also dented the right side of the oven near the range top badly. Three out of four of the appliances started having technical issues almost immediately. The oven controls lock up intermittently and you can't do anything so if the oven is on you can't even turn it off and if it is off you can't even turn it on so I have to constantly flip the breaker to reset it. The refrigerator keeps building up huge chunks of ice on the vent for the icemaker next to the door. The microwaves built in range hood randomly turns off whenever it feels like it and now the fan in the microwave has given out and it is not working at all. When you call Costco concierge about it you are on hold for huge amounts of time before they basically trade you off to LG and they schedule the same idiot repair guys to constantly come out but nothing ever gets fixed. They have been here for each appliance multiple times for a year and a half (during a pandemic so you don't really want them here) and we still have the same problems with all 3 appliances plus a new problem now where the microwave doesn't even work. So you call Costco Concierge again and again and no one seems to know what to do but what they are not doing is standing up against the manufacturer for their customers. It has been whatever LG wants to do but I still have dysfunctional appliances after a year and a half! Also, remember the damage to the side of the oven listed above? It was found the first time the oven was pulled out for repair but Costco won't do anything about it because ""none of their guys admitted doing it."" Really!!! Yeah, they're just going to admit it. And how can I have damaged it when they installed it and it hadn't been pulled out since? As for the microwave we are at the point where the parts are discontinued and it CAN NOT BE REPAIRED! Yet after a week of not having a microwave, Costco Concierge has been unable to tell us what they are going to do about that. So what am I supposed to do when the warranty on these pieces of junk expires in 6 months? Costco Concierge can't help you with that either. My advice is to not let Costco's supposed white glove service or the Costco Concierge service sway your purchasing of appliances at all because in the end it is not worth anything. I would also advise against buying anything from LG at this point.",0,1

I waited on the phone for nearly 2 hours to discuss a simple return (there was no other way given to contact Costco - no email, instant message, nothing!) and upon finally getting through, spoke to a woman who was blatantly rude and unhelpful and hung up on me before my questions were fully answered. I then needed to call Costco back - meaning over 3 hours of my day was spent to resolve a simple return. I'm so frustrated and disheartened.

I came in yesterday and made purchases and the male cashier easily clicked on my Costo ID and it worked right away the same one the female cashier said was bad. I feel hassled. Also I only have a Discover and a Mastercard and they don't take either one. Why is Costco the ONLY retail store not accepting these 2 most SIGNIFICANT credit cards people carry? I'm off work today Labor Day and the only time I have this week to shop at Costo they are closed. Both these 2 scenarios make a Costo experience very unpleasant.

Costco Wholesale,Worst customer service experience!,"I called Innovel on Tuesday, August 25th to schedule delivery for a range and dishwasher. I was given a delivery date and time of 8/31/2020 between 0800-1100hrs. I was told the night prior to the delivery I would receive a phone call after 6pm with a two hour delivery window. No call was received. I was at the residence all morning on 8/31 but no items were received. I called Innovel on 8/31/2020 around noon and was on hold for approximately 30 minutes waiting for an employee to answer. The employee that answered confirmed the delivery time but stated the carrier didn't have our delivery on the schedule. She then placed me on hold for approximately 20 minutes then the line disconnected and she didn't call me back. I waited five minutes then recalled Innovel and waited another 30 plus minutes for an employee to answer the phone. This employee provided the same information then contacted the Charlotte Warehouse to get an update. The Innovel employee stated that Eric at the Charlotte Warehouse completed a manual dock search and they didn't have my items at the warehouse and that I needed to speak with a Costco Representative. Innovel transferred me to Costco Rep. Costco Rep. confirmed the items were received at the warehouse then placed me on hold for at least twenty minutes. The next person to answer the phone was a different employee at Innovel. I was transferred back to their company without notification or an introduction to the employee. So I had to restate everything. This employee again called the Warehouse and requested another dock search. I was told I would receive a call back in 30 minutes with an update. After an hour, I still hadn't received an update so I called Innovel again, and again waited approximately 30 minutes for an employee to answer the phone. This employee attempted contact again with the warehouse but no one answered the phone. He also obtained phone numbers for employees at the warehouse but no answer on those numbers.On 9/1/2020 I waited on hold for 35 minutes trying to contact Costco.com customer service and again repeated everything that had occurred. I was again transferred to Innovel. Innovel confirmed the items were at the warehouse and provided a new delivery date of 9/2/2020. I wasn't provided a time frame but that the night prior we would receive a call to provide a two hour delivery window. No call was received.On 9/2/2020 I called Innovel at 1100hrs east coast time for an update on delivery time. It took approximately 30 minutes before an employee answered the phone. I was told delivery would be between 0800-1100hrs east coast time. I asked for confirmation that it hadn't already been delivered. I was then told it wasn't going to be delivered because the carrier couldn't find the items at the warehouse. I was given a new delivery date because the items had since been located. I was told it would be delivered on 9/3/2020 and to expect a phone call with the two hour delivery window after 6pm. At 6pm east coast time I received an email changing the delivery date from 9/3/2020 to 9/4/2020. I received no phone call with this updated delivery date. I called Innovel on 9/2/2020 around 8pm east coast time and waited approximately 30 minutes for an employee to answer. I was told the delivery was rescheduled for 9/4/2020 because the delivery service is closed on Thursday (9/3/2020).This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had. My biggest frustration is that I, as the customer, am forced to problem solve Costco's logistics issues. I have wasted at least seven hours of my time to resolve the incompetence of Costco and their delivery service. I will be sharing the contents of this email on any public platform that I can access. How do you plan on making this right?",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Two identical on-line orders…,"Two identical on-line orders self-cancelled, with zero indication “why.”I placed the same order a third time, and got an e-mail message that Costco’s credit card issuer declined my card.It took me (quite literally) HOURS on the phone with Costco’s card insurer, and Costco, to learn that the 2 self-cancelled orders DID NOT cancel, and were sitting on my card as PENDING CHARGES, which put me over my credit limit. After 88 minutes on hold last night, Costco told me they would straighten the problem out with their card issuer, but DID NOT! It took me another 55 minutes on hold this morning, to reach a Costco agent. She told me everything “SHOULD” work in another few days. I told er I didn’t HAVE another few days, that the $100 rebate on what I was trying to order, ENDED, at the end of August. I asked her for a “Raincheck.” She told me Costco doesn’t give rain checks. I asked for her supervisor. It took another 25 minutes before she came on the line. After going around with her, she said she would extend the rebate for 30 days. Question: Why didn’t Costco “extend the rebate,” within the first 5 minutes of my first call?",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Not happy with the tire center,"I’ve been a Costco customer for many years and generally very satisfied with everything. I used the services of the Costco Tire Center in Apex, NC for the first time this week. My car needed all 4 tires replaced. Costco has a system where you can order the tires online, have them delivered to the tire center, and make an appointment for installation. All that went well, and Costco did have the best price overall that I could find on these fairly expensive “run flat” tires my car needed. The installation itself was fine, took an hour like they said. Once I got my keys back, I decided to pick up a few things in Costco before I went home. Once I purchased my items, I went outside to look for my car. Turns out it was pretty far back in the parking lot; the store was crowded. What I found was that all 4 tires sidewalls were covered in this yellowish grease, also dripping onto the rims. I couldn’t believe Costco left my car looking like this. I understand they may need whatever this stuff is during the process of putting the tires on the rims, but for G_d sakes clean it off!. I spent well over $800 on tires and they leave my car a mess. Couldn’t help but notice the signs in the store that tout a 10 point inspection that must be done by a manager before my car is released. Is clean the gross, disgusting grease all over the place not one of the 10 points? Now here a I am, long walk from the entrance, 95 degrees, and a cart of groceries, so couldn’t go back inside and speak to anyone without the refrigerated/frozen groceries probably spoiling. I’m very disappointed that I received my car back in this condition. Costco needs to do better.",0,2

Costco Wholesale,Negative experience with Costco Bureaucracy,"As a disclaimer I often will ""use"" my roommates membership by going with him to Costco in order to make purchases as I am a student on a budget and found it redundant for me to pay for a membership while I could go with him - and did so online with regards to the following purchase as well.I ordered tires online from Costco and wanted to have them installed at their Tire Center as I had heard good things. I used their online tire guide to order the appropriate tire size for my 2014 Honda Accord with no apparent issue. The deal itself was pretty good (in comparison to other local tire companies) so I went through with the purchase using my card on his account. I then found they unfortunately were booked up for a week so I set an appointment time for then - no big deal, very understandable given these times and my personal location being bigger and busier than the typical Costco.In the meantime, I got a somewhat foreboding email stating if I was late they essentially would not honor my appointment so I made sure to be on time for the appointment. When I showed up they notified me that I would still actually have to wait up to 2 HOURS for my appointment with no acknowledgment that this is not actually the meaning of 'honoring an appointment' but instead told me ""yeah sometimes we have walk-ins and stuff so there's a wait."" Fine, I waited what ended up being an hour an half.Then I found out I had ordered the wrong tires using their online tool so the Tire Center had politely and smartly located the appropriate size in stock at the store, which in addition, happened to be comparable in price to the ones I had purchased. So, so far besides the surprise wait time everything's fine. When I go up to get the keys and provide them with my card for the purchase they suddenly remark that they will eventually need the account holder to physically come into the store in order for them to process the refund, which is problematic as the account holder is my roommate's Mother who lives two hours out of town, on top of the whole COVID wrinkle and the fact that my roommate himself (a member himself on her account) was their to authenticate the purchase. This is told to us by Tire Center 'manager' who suddenly seems very irritated and cold and sort of gave off the impression of being taken aback about me not being on the account and communicated this in a passive-aggressive manner.We eventually settle on calling upper management for the store as this specific tire center manager had become somewhat short with us and kept stonewalling our attempts to ask him to reconsider this 'policy.' This required multiple phone calls between me, my roommate, the card holder (his mom) and their audit team who still attempted to have her drive up from out of town even though I had used my credit card for the purchase as previously indicated to them. I eventually implored the audit team to process my refund over the phone as they had then decided that instead of having the cardholder come in now I just needed to come in - even though they had my information from the previous purchase? I eventually got them to process the refund over the phone. As of about a week after, I'm still waiting for my refund.While I fully understand that I am somewhat at fault due to using my roommates account instead of my own, I've also never really experienced a company's bureaucracy seem petty and disingenuous in this particular manner. If this whole membership thing was as significant of an issue as they made it seem, they easily could have simply refused the second purchase when I explained to the tire center manager the situation in the first place, which while unfavorable to me would actually seem to be a somewhat understandable thing for a membership-based company to do. Instead they happily re-approved the new purchase after doing so suddenly seemed rather intent on holding my refund hostage, not even honoring their own membership system (in regards to roommate being their to authenticate the purchase), as well as eventually being somewhat stubborn and robotic in regards to the various inappropriate, demanding hoops we were threatened to jump through due to their 'policy.'Overall, this is emblematic of the types of changes I have seen made to Costco customer service and general business dealings over the past 10 years (no longer offering to box/pack products at the check out line but instead putting each individual item directly in the cart which is inconsiderate and lazy, multiple instances in which employees were short or arrogant in interaction or not knowing where anything in the store is, continually shrinking portion sizes of perishables to the point of not really selling in bulk, to name a few). It's just sad to see a company make such a hard and sneaky transition into so obviously maximizing profit margins.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,This is a big one they really could…Linda Coy,"This is a big one they really could have cost me my life. During the pandemic I received medication from Costco that was outdated the hormone was either very low or not in there at all I became very ill starting with my hair to my skin to my internal organs my joints, And muscles everything about me felt abnormal when I approached Cosco for information because I suspected the medication they were not helpful at all they would not give me the lot number so I could check the date it was sent from the lab to them I had to pray on the mercies of my own doctor to believe me and give me a new prescription.I wasn’t even able to go to the doctor. Of course we did the bloodwork found it my thyroid was so low, this is not funny Them hiding information is not funny, they should have given me the information that I needed to protect my own Health Allergan the manufacture of the medicine could have told me everything I needed to know if I had been given the lot number but Cosco refused. They used an excuse that they don’t keep the lot numbers once they dispense the medication bad excuse. I am not sure what I should do about this at this point never get my medicine there for one thing. But all the food and drug administration Stop their practice of not keeping track of what goes out their window in the form of lot numbers so the manufacture will know what you are taking. Or should it be a attorney that deals with all of this right now I have been up new medication for three weeks I’ve noticedA difference in three days and have continually gotten better so they are’s no question about it being the medication.

Costco Wholesale,Costco,"Costco, once my favorite store has quickly become a terrible place to shop. Tires order on-line were still not ""shipped"" three weeks after the order, yet I purchased the exact same tire at ""America's Tire Store"" (a great place by the way). They were able to get the tires to their store within 8 hours and installed them the next day. Overall cost (with same free rotation and flat repair) was $30 more, a price well worth it. Then my Samsung refrigerator ordered on-line had an estimated delivery date of three weeks. I was ok with that, but the install date arrived and went with NO contact from Costco. After calling a waiting 65 minutes on hold, I find out the unit won't ship for another 4 weeks - which may also be yet another lie! Very, very disappointed with the poor customer service with these on-line orders. Look for other discount stores for your tires and appliances.

Costco Wholesale,Sofa/Loveseat delivery Snaffu,"Ordered a leather reclining Sofa + Loveseat with Free Choice of Rooms Delivery included!

Meanwhile I called Costco Cust Service: was on hold for 97 mins before I had a patronizing rep, Ms. Rafael, who kept apologizing and asking me to repeat myself over and over again. After 20+ apologies I asked her to stop and instead correct things. She never seemed to get the message/point I was trying to make regarding the disappointing service we had received. I then asked her to escalate to her sup. and I ended up speaking with Kalia (several minutes later) who was belligerent, talking over me disrespectfully, telling me that some delivery co’s can elect not to deliver to a particular Room of choice (whaaat?? this Sofa weighs 301lbs and it was included on the order).

On that day I spent 76 minutes on hold with costumer service wanting to know what was going on with the freezer.

She even raised her voice with me!! We FINALLY received the freezer on August 12. SEVERELY DAMAGED!! It looked as if it had been dropped 5 feet and rolled a couple of times. It was badly dented, cracked, and damaged. So once again I spent over an hour on the phone with costumer service. The woman I spoke to didn't ask for any pictures or evidence of the damage. She put me on hold to ""talk with her superviser Jeff"". When she finally got back to me she said that based on the info I gave her the baest they could do was take off $100. She also said that this was because it only had a few dings. and was not late. I reminded her that In fact it WAS LATE and had more than a few dings. Then I asked if we could get an extended warranty because at this point we don't even know if it will work or for how long it will work. She said they don't deal with that at all. That is the manufacturer. There was no place for me to show them the damage. No place I could upload pics. I will NEVER be usung costco.com EVER again.

I do not have a contactless card( and I’m not sure if that even works at this location), and I have to punch the pin. That is fine, but as a curtesy for the clients , I think it should be store’s policy to clean the pad these days, until the virus is less spread in California .Second , the guy who brought the carts in the store almost hit me. I was with my two children and trying to juggle my own cart and them. I was not in the way, I did not see him as he just came in pushing 10-15 carts. He scared me when he touched me with me with one of the carts as he was making his way in the store. He did not say he’s sorry.",0,3

Their information on the delivery confirmation email and phone calls from the delivery company are incorrect: receiving a call 30 min prior to the delivery arrival will never happen! (not to mention the scheduling process was a headache too)I have made two online purchases recently. First delivery was furniture from Fragilepak, the guys called me 5 min before they arrive. Same thing happened to the 2nd and 3rd delivery(TV delivered by CEVA Logistics and was damaged on the 2nd delivery), so on the 3rd delivery, after I rushed to the delivery address again! The delivery guy dropped off the item with an angry face. He was supposed to unbox it to make sure no damages on the TV! When I asked him to do it, he just turned and left! What a great experience with Costco delivery!!!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Juan Salesperson in Optical,The sales person that helped me in the optical dept. by the name of Juan was the best. Hot the best glasses i could ever find. I'll be going to the optical at costco for all my glasses. The we're way better them Wal-Mart. I thought you save money if you to Wal-Mart of course that's not true.

Costco Wholesale,Horrible first experience shopping at costco.…,"I ordered a generator at the store online. I got a confirmation number, later that evening I get an email stating my order was cancelled. I gave me several reason why perhaps my order was cancelled and so I reorder thinking it was due to an error on my billing address. Second order was cancelled as well, again with non specific reason as to why. Meanwhile my account has been billed for two generators I wont get delivered and I am currently waiting to speak to someone on the phone, estimated wait time 70 min.

Costco Wholesale,I'd give a negative star if it allows,"I'd give a negative star if it allows. The worst customer service ever!!! I ordered online and realized that I made a mistake. Costco.com doesn't allow you to add new items to the order that you just placed. And it doesn't have the ""Cancel"" button it claims that allows you to cancel within an hour. I decided to give them a call, which is the worst nightmare. It tells you that you will need to wait for 70 minutes before talking to anyone. I decided to give the callback number. They took at least an hour and half to call me back. After they call me back, I had to wait almost 4 to 5 minutes to talk to anyone. Once I told her that I need to cancel the order. She disappeared and let me wait forever! I am still waiting for her to get back to me. It's 35 minutes already and I'm still waiting!!! No any updates from online, my email etc. She just disappeared! Didn't provide any updates! I finally hung up the call! So frustrated!!!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,What on earth has happened to Costco,"So I stopped by to pick up a few things and was in a hurry. Costco is not the best bet when you need something fast, but there wasn't much of a crowd and checkout was moving along pretty well. Until the cashier came out from behind the register and asked if he could ""speak to me for a minute."" I thought, WT[bleep]? He went on to say, sotto voce like he was scolding a bad child in a restaurant, that ""the register told me that you qualify for an executive membership and I think you should upgrade.""What. The. Actual. [bleep].I stared at him like he had two heads, trying to comprehend why he was acting like some undercover dick who was letting me in on some secret deal. I told him I didn't have time for that and could he just check me out? Well, no, he couldn't, because since I declined the membership upgrade, I HAD TO SPEAK TO A SALESPERSON FIRST before he could continue ringing me up.What. The. Actual. [bleep].So some chick with a clipboard comes over and tells me that if I follow her, she could show me how much I would have saved last year if I'd had an executive membership. Me, again: :-O It took several expletives to get her to unlock the register so I could continue with my purchase. She also made me take out my membership card so she could write down the number, because if she didn't put me on some opt-out list, I would be stopped EVERY TIME I SHOPPED AT A COSTCO and given the same [bleep] sales spiel.What. The. Actual. [bleep].What has happened to Costco? They've been sliding downhill in many ways in the last couple of years, but THIS????? Really????? Are they so pathetically desperate for money that they're stopping shoppers in their tracks and holding their orders hostage so they'll listen to a sales talk, like they're thinking about a [bleep]ing timeshare?Simply stunned. If you really want to upsell me, send me a goddamned letter. Stopping people at the register! OM[bleep]G!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Employees' Refusal to Help Elderly with Heavy Items,"I went to Costco and the employee told me I couldn't enter the store in order to help my mom push the cart and lift water into the cart since it was for the time that only those who are high risk to enter (she doesn't have a lot of strength). The employee told me that the employees inside will help lift the water so I said okay and waited in the car. My mother complained to me since she asked not one but three employees to help and they said ""we're busy"" and just left her alone!

They received a message while sleeping that was unintelligible that apparently was the “white glove” delivery service trying to deliver it! (after 9:30 PM). They were then rudely told they missed their delivery and had to wait 2 more days. Today they waited all day just to receive nothing and then were told the couches had been delivered to the wrong address!! What!! Now they are on hold for over an hour to try to cancel the order because they have already had the money removed from their bank account!! Seriously!! They are 70 years old and have to sit on the floor because they have no furniture and no funds to purchase elsewhere. How is this acceptable. I will be filing a BBB report tonight!!

I wish I had read the reviews before I placed my online order for 65in Samsung TV. I suppose to gotten my TV yesterday. However, it was not delivered. When I called the delivery company, Ceva Logistics, that Costco contracted, I was met with rudeness and unprofessional attitude. No apology at all...just hung up on. I could not get through Costco online customer service as usual. I contacted the cery nice Costco manager at their Peachtree City,GA location. Mike was so nice and was able to get through to Costco online customer service rep, Samantha. Who was all but useless. But she did provide me with a direct number to contact her, if I did not receive my delivery today between the designated time. Well. I have not yet received my TV and is well pass the scheduled delivery time. I tried several times to reach out to Samantha without success or a return call. This is not the customer friendly, dependable and honest Costco i have been excitely partnered with since 2003. This online Costco i want nothing to do with. This online Costco is horrible, unorganized, unprofessional and not dependable to say the least. Costco should be ashamed to have this online department associated with their company. Not to mention, no Costco customer should be treated this poorly!!! From reading all of the reviews, it appears that Costco online department poor treatment of thier customer is their standard practice!! WELL SHAME ON YOU COSTCO.

Costco Wholesale,"COSTCO ONLINE DELIVERY IS LOUSY, NOT EVEN CLOSE TO AMAZON EXPERIENCE","First of all., Do not buy furniture from Costco online because the quality and color of the items are often different from what shows on Costco website.Costco use a delivery company called Metropolitan warehouse and delivery. The service from this company is a total mess even Costco says it is white glove delivery. Metropolitan holds my furniture in their warehouse for 11 days without scheduling a delivery, then suddenly called and asked me to be at home in 15 minutes to receive the delivery. They then simply did not bother to call or show after I waited for them. It has been 26 days since my order on 7/6/2020, I still have not got my furniture and I do not know they can deliver the next week. If you want to return, you have to carry the heavy furniture to curbside to be picked up.I believe Costco know the problem with this delivery carrier for quite while and does not appear to do something real to help its customer.

Costco Wholesale,VERY DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET CUSTOMER,"My husband and I went shopping at Costco today where the purchase would have been about $300 worth of items. I am a member but my husband is not on the membership, he was a guest when we went shopping. When it came time to checkout, I had to use the bathroom so I gave my husband the membership card to proceed to the checkout and for him to pay as he’s done before with his own debit card. I come back from the bathroom and my husband proceeds to tell me that he is not allowed to pay since he is not a member. I understood this and decided to use my husband’s debit card to pay since I didn’t bring my purse or wallet with me. My husband has paid before because we’ve been doing this many times and are from the same household. The sale’s associate proceeds to tell me that I’m still unable to pay since I would be using my husband’s debit card and it is against policy since it is not mine. I have been going to Costco for the past 10 years and this has not once become an issue that I was aware of. My husband and I left Costco with nothing after shopping for an hour. We go there every month and spend over thousands a year. When we were heading back home I went on the Costco site to look at member rules and I did not see anywhere that it said that non members are not allowed to pay as a guest with the member. I called customer service after checking the rules and the lady proceeded to tell me that non members are not allowed to pay. I understood this but then asked her to read it out loud from the rules and read the fine print for me. I wanted to hear that it was in the rules and maybe I missed something. She refused to read anything off of the rules and just kept telling me it was against policy. She was really rude to me and said, “I’m done. I’m not arguing with you.” She then hung up on me. Does it really matter who pays for the purchase as long as the member is there? Costco is still getting their money regardless. I didn’t think I was breaking any rules. I paid for my membership, my husband was a guest along side me and he’s been paying for the purchases many times before and this is the first time they enforced the rule onto me after 10 years. Needless to say, Costco just lost a $300 dollar sale and will be losing thousands from me a year from now on because I am canceling my membership.

This is terrible service requiring me to run around and do their job for them, nearly a 2 week delay in product delivery because of their data entry issues, two hours on the phone to try to sort it out, and no follow-through, or profess to care at all how much inconvenience this has been or attempt to take accountability for their lack of service.

Sides unsealed and looks like handlers tried to picked it up by sliding their hands in the top. Its ripped up, dented on sides, and a hole punched into one side.

Costco Wholesale,Our Costco Appliance Nightmare,"Appliance delivery and installation is a nightmare. Needed to buy a new washer and dryer, went to the warehouse and saw the washer/dryer we wanted but found out that to have the appliances delivered and installed we have to buy online. But we bought the stacking kit at the warehouse, with the associates' help to be sure we got the correct one. Got home and ordered the appliances online (without the stacking kit since we already had it). Set up delivery for a week later. Installers arrive and tell us they can't install and stack the washer and dryer b/c ""it does not say to stack on the order."" I show them the stacking kit and they refuse to install using the same stacking kit I just bought at the warehouse. They got in their truck and left. I called Costco customer service and waited on hold for 120 minutes to speak to a human. I was told that I have to buy the stacking kit online with the washer and dryer in order to have the machines stacked. I would have to cancel my order, and place a whole new order --AND WAIT ANOTHER 2+ WEEKS. I explained that I need a washer, we are in the middle of a pandemic and I am in a high risk group so it is not advisable me to go to laundry mats. Costco does not care. Their supervisors do not care. It did not matter to them that I had already waited one week and had already paid for two machines that were on a delivery truck. (What was going to happen to those machines?) And I had already bought the stacking kit at the warehouse and had that in my possession.(What am I supposed to do with this stacking kit?) Costco is simply too inflexible and unwilling to edit or revise an existing order. They will not pick up the phone and call the delivery company and revise the paperwork for the rigid installation company. Instead Costco forces the customer to cancel their order, repurchase the same items, and GO TO THE BACK OF THE LINE TO WAIT FOR AN INSTALLATION DATE AGAIN. I explained to the customer service rep that I spent an entire day cleaning out my laundry room and pantry for this installation. I have boxes and food items all over my family room and kitchen. I cannot wait 2+ more weeks for Costco's next delivery date. I wanted to give Costco the opportunity to make this right and to keep me as a customer but they failed to even try. BOTTOM LINE: I will never use Costco again. Instead I called the local family owned appliance store and bought the same washer and dryer. It will be installed in 3 days. I paid a little more, but it is certainly worth it to have the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong I have a REAL human sales person, and installers who work for the store. If you are thinking about buying appliances from Costco, all I can say is DON'T DO IT. If you have all the time in the world, and don't mind being without your appliances, then you will save a few dollars, but it will cost you in anxiety, and frustration.",0,1

I said I don't mean to cause problems. So then she the lady who did the trash came back. Again I stepped back to lower my mask and the manager said put your mask back on. I smiled, and she said ""it's not funny, put your mask back on!"" (I wasn't laughing, I was smiling). So it is ok to handle my glasses with trash hands but I am yelled at about my mask. I have dealt with a couple of other rude people in that optical also. Except one young Hispanic guy was great. Glad I am not getting my next glasses from there. They are not good quality.

Then the delivery driver runs over my landscaping. Moving on to the furniture console I ordered it was set to arrive on a weds no timeframe given but I finally called mid day they said up til 5pm. I get a call an hour later stating they had to cancel and would come tomorrow. Again a 2nd day off work only for the crews delivering to be rude and deliver it damaged. I file for an exchange which wait times are at least an hour so at this point I’ve had to call at least 3 times to get things cleared up. They arrange for an exchange no contact is made for over a week until they call to confirm delivery. Come to find out though Costco didn’t put through the pick up so they were delivering the new console without taking the old one which I have no room for. I know have another day off work and another for the pick up. I place yet another call in and told I will be called back within 48 hours well still no call and the new delivery arrived also damaged. I’ve now been on the phone for over an hour to dispute the new one and asked for a shop card or credit in the amount of the product plus to keep the 2nd damaged once since I don’t want to go through this process any longer and I’ve spent more time & energy on this then should have been. Doesn’t seem they are willing to work with me and want to pick up both which that could be week or longer at this point so not sure how to even get my money back and the damaged products out of my house, not to mention my time back that was wasted in this entire process. DO NOT purchase from Costco.com it’s by far some of the worst service I’ve ever had!!!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Costcos customer service in Arvada CO,"My dad and I went to Costco on 52 in Wadsworth in Arvada CO. The employees are awful there. As we were walking in and showing the greeter our membership card she asked my father if he had a mask? He said yes, but tried to explain to her that he couldn't breathe when he wore it. She rudely to him needed to wear it. My father put on his mask. He looked at me and said he felt like passing out. I asked him if need to sit down he stopped and pulled he mask down and took a few deep breaths and started walking. Five steps in with his musk pulled down a Costco employee stop us and told him he needed to put his mask on. My dad told him I really have a hard time breathing with it on. The Costco employee then told him should've told the person at the door about his condition. My dad said I did. The Costco employee then tells my dad that he need needed to take his mask completely off. My dad looked him confused then the Costco employee started raising his voice repeating to my dad that he needed to take off his mask and he would notify all Costo employees ""That the only man in the store not wearing a mask has a breathing condition. I was so upset. Every aisle we down there was that employee worker. My dad forgot the whole thing within a few minutes ( my father is elderly but you wouldn't guess it because he looks great) I told him let's get out of here because I was so upset and left our cart. He completely forgot how we treated, however i have not!!! Please don't sent me a pre written email saying sorry for your experience because that's like a slap in the face!!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco doesn't recognize or compensate at all for their own screw ups,"I called Costco customer service on the day I was supposed to receive my order (which was an hour and 20 minute call, which I waited for 65 minutes before I got on the line with a live person). The rep named Asher was a know it all who knew nothing at all. First he said ""oh this is one of those orders"" referring to one that UPS picks up and never updates. Then he verified with UPS that the package was never picked up. Then he says ""oh I have to do an exchange"", whatever that meant. He said Costco would have to reship it. So then I told him since I was supposed to receive this today (july 7th) can you at least upgrade the shipping? And he said ""I was just about to tell you that's what I was gonna do"". But he never upgraded anything. The original package that never left Costco warehouse was UPS 3 day and now this package is also UPS 3 day ( guess what?, the phantom package that was never shipped has the exact same tracking number as the new shipment). A package that I was billed for and never even shipped, but I was supposed to receive on July 7th is now slated to be here on July 13th. So this problem was not prioritized at all even though it was clearly Costco's fault for the extreme shipping delay. Thanks for nothing Costco and Asher...I have never had a problem with Costco in-club customer service, but apparently the customer service phone reps are lesser quality. Which shouldn't be Costco, because they are representing you! Asher didn't screw up...Costco did because they hired him!Rather than waste an hour and a half on the phone, I should've just called my credit card company (Citibank Costco Visa), and filed an item not received complaint and re-ordered the item. It would have taken me about an hour less than calling and I would have achieved the same result. Hey Costco, our time is worth money too!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Zero is my review rating of my…,"Zero is my review rating of my experience ordering from Costco.com for the first time. I ordered two Wilson badminton sets on May 22, 2020 & by June 5th I had received one. I researched on my own time that the second set was last scanned in my city via UPS on June 5th & then no contact from anyone regarding the second missing set. I had to go through (& still going through) Hell to find out it “disappeared” & I had to file a claim which I did. Hours spent on the phone trying to get help proved very difficult & time consuming & I finally got a live voice call back & thought the issue was resolved with me getting a refund as their were no more badminton sets to replace per customer service. Fine- well yesterday I received an email stating I had to print a return label to return the one badminton set I did receive which was a gift & long gone. How could this be so hard? I also called my local Warehouse & demanded to speak with a manager who took time to call someone & after 15 or so minutes she stated I would finally receive a refund but I doubt very seriously that this issue is truly resolved since I was told that once before. If I do not receive a refund, I plan on going to the local warehouse customer service & demand assistance & a refund. I feellike I’m being ripped off by a business that I enjoyed shopping at & have spent lots of money at this last year in particular & no one should be treated as all of us on this review site have been treated. The COVID -19 is no excuse for terrible customer service when Costco has profited millions from customers that trusted them. Shame on Costco for taking advantage of Americans that trusted them.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,A combination of shipping problems,"A combination of problems, one with the shipping company (CEVA) and then with Costco customer service. In both cases the wait time to talk with some one is always greater than an hour. The problem with CEVA is that they scheduled the delivery time and date, the day before the scheduled delivery they sent me a text confirming the time. On the scheduled date NO Delivery, NO call and NO text. I called CEVA to check on the delivery. Was told that they would call me in one or two days and reschedule the delivery. Two days latter I had not heard from CEVA and called them again (another 1-2 hr wait). I was informed that the delivery was still in Dallas and they would call me in one or two days to let me know when they would reschedule the delivery. I then called Costco customer service (another 1-2 hr wait) and was given absolutely no help. The young lady, after putting me on hold, told me that someone would call me in one or two days to schedule the delivery. This seems like an easy answer to all the questions so that no one takes any responsibility for the problems.

Costco Wholesale,Costco Could Have Killed As All with those Pin Pads,"So... Due to Covid, Costco is no longer putting air in people's car tires. Because suddenly, three months after Covid hit, they care. Yes. They care. In fact, they all of a sudden - magically even - care SO MUCH about everyone's safety and health that they want to reduce the contact between people and customers to eliminate any possibility for a Covid outbreak. So they've set up a station whereby people who pay $155 a year for a Costco membership and who buy Costco tires for the specific reason of having Costco maintain them, can fill their own tires. Apparently tires are now a Covid threat.Because usually before I go to Costco I spend some up close and personal time getting intimate with my tires. I talk to them, breath on them, maybe accidentally pant or sneeze on them, or cough - maybe - on them, touch them - tires need love too. I don't know; it's possible - I mean it could happen that I might accidentally lick them if I get too close, just because. You know how things can go with tires. So, I can see how the kindly people at Costco would be concerned that their employees might get Covid from my tires.I am thoroughly disgusted and disappointed with Costco's latest excuse to back out of providing good customer service under the guise of pretending to care about their employee's and customer's health. Dear Costco, if you truly cared about your customer's health, you would have had a jumbo size container of Clorox wipes by the pin pad at every checkout counter at every Costco across the country from day one, because if Covid really is the threat that you are pretending it is, your credit card pin pads would have killed hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people by now.And FYI, spotlighting one of your customer's complaints about forcing your customers to wear a mask THREE MONTHS INTO the so-called pandemic, is a despicable way to utilize fear, hate, and mob idiocy to shame a person who is voicing a fair concern about your tardy and pathetic store policy, and the worthlessness of masks as documented by OSHA on their website.If I could give zero stars for customer service and using Covid as an excuse to go as cheap and low as a store can go, I would.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Costco.com needs to get it together,"We understand these are trying times, but Costco.com needs to get it together.Wait times and staffing levels: With unemployment rates as high as they are, at the very least, temporary employees could help with the daily online chat queue of 500 people, or the call center wait time of several hours (with some days, no calls going through at all). During this lucrative time for them, they really should be looking at bulking up their customer service end.Customer Service: 1 out of 5 contacts with online support were actually what we've come to expect from the helpful service Costco typically provides. That's too low IMHO. After our experience, online orders are most likely off the table, as there appears to be a serious disconnect between the customer service from their local clubs and online. Costco branded credit card: This whole experience needs some serious tweaking. Not sure why Costco.com even touts a Visa branded card with extra perks (additional cashback and warranty years) for appliance sales, when it's not even possible to use the card right away for online purchases. By the time the card arrives, the sale is over. Negative points for Costco online (accept for one particular rep) and Citibank customer service.Supply chain: Even though Costco's site states appliances will ship quick, if the only thing holding up a bundled order is a microwave for nearly 3 weeks, then ship everything else, and let the customer pick up the microwave at a local club later (after shipping to the club). Our order took almost a month and a half, which shows a severely broken supply chain.Communication: Not only did we feel left guessing most of the time, but the white glove delivery team did not followup with any communication. It took daily calls and reminders to get them to even set a date. They had little to no contact information passed along on their end (or so they say) and no call no showed on their first scheduled appointment. Delivery team and product condition: The ONLY saving grace in this whole process was the delivery guys, Elvis and Jesus. Can't really say anything great about XPO as a whole (for the most part, they lived up to their awful online reviews), but these delivery guys were so nice, helpful and professional. Unfortunately, the dishwasher was dented and needed to be rejected/returned.Current state: So here we are, nearly a month and a half later, waiting for Costco online to make this right. Elvis had confidence that Costco would step up and make this right quickly, but after a long wait and communication with online support, they were again unhelpful with no resolution timeframe given. It took several days for the resolution team to provide any clarification. We still have not been told when the new dishwasher will arrive, but aren't holding our breath either. We ordered these appliances back in mid May, figuring that they would be ordered, shipped and installed way in time for our 4th of July family get together, but sadly, that is not the case at all. And here we are, still waiting.Future outlook: As mentioned previously, Costco has always been synonymous with exceptional customer service. Unfortunately, with Costco.com, the time, effort, energy, stress and lackluster experience have not been worth the savings or extended waranty (and that's saying a lot). At this point, we can confidently say that we wouldn't speak highly or recommend to our network of making future purchases through Costco.com.Costco, your better than this, and we only wish we could have reported back with a positive experience. We only hope this feedback is valuable and productive, so future members get the online experience we had originally planned on and hoped for.",0,1

This all started when an employee in produce said I have to put on a mask and then proceeded to allow people to literally yell on top of their lungs at me. Some will say serves me right for not having a mask but it’s still just a mandate and not a law. I was doing nothing illegal yet Costco did not stop this fiasco.

The 2 times I tried to but the laptop my order was cancelled by Costco.com by email. Frustrated, I call the number offered online, which made me wait 2 hours for a call back. I was then almost 1 hour over the phone, and I ended the call without a satisfactory solution to the issue. See below.1. I changed the card and billing address during the checkout process.2. After speaking with your agent over the phone and reviewing the order, it looks like Costco.com ignored completely the change I made in the billing address, and inserted the old billing address in the order (without my knowledge or awareness).3. The website did the same thing twice! That is why I decided to call to find out what the issue was.4. At this point I had placed the order twice, and the order was cancelled by Costco.com twice.5. Once the issue was discovered, I proceeded to place the order, with the big surprise that the system no longer gave me the $200 discount because “I already placed the order twice and the limit it is 2 per customer,” however, the 2 times the order was CANCELLED, which means, I still haven’t ordered the laptop!6. The agent over the phone spent a long time trying to figure out, and came back to me suggesting to buy the computer at full price, and call again when I get the computer, that Costco.com will give me the $200 back. REALLY? What type of system of online ordering does Costco have that doesn't detect cancelled orders? What type of service is this?7. The mistake in Costco's system is making me work twice for an offer Costco made in print and online that supposed to be automatic! This is completely unacceptable. Why do I have to be over the phone again for over an hour to get the $200 ""instant"" discount? It is Costco.com the problem, not me! What guarantees me that I will get my money back? I don’t see anything in writing on this regard.Thanks to the MEDIOCRE online ordering system of Costco.com, I was not able to get the computer I was looking forward to buying.

I asked them to please look into my order to assure trucker didn't forget about my order. They said everything seems fine, the items delivered to XPO on 6/8/20 according to their system and not to worry. They gave me Samsung and XPO phone numbers just in case I need to call them.

Costco Wholesale,Bait and Switch,I have been waiting to buy this generator: Firman 7500W Running / 9400W Peak Tri Fuel Generator. It was in my monthly ad for $599.99 and said to be available online. But when I tried to order it the price was $699.99. I waited an hour and a half to speak to a customer service rep to help me and she said that there was nothing she could do about the online price being $100 more. This is unacceptable!!!,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Bad Customerservice,"I went to the Costco on Elliott Rd in Phoeniz AZ this morning. i waited for the clerk to come out of the room. I told her I have called two times to schedule a eye appt. I ask her to just make me appt, as I know I couldn't be seem today. Her reply was to call I told her again they don't return my calls, if she could just schedule a appt. She refused.

Costco Wholesale,Super Bad Delivery Experience,"Costco delivery team & customer service are super unprofessional and irresponsible. Due to their fault, I have to sleep on the floor for 3 days until my mattress can get delivered, and they try to blame me for the whole thing! Shame on them.I ordered a mattress and foundation on Costo.com on June 11, 2020, and scheduled the delivery to be June 24th. I called about one week before delivery time to get them informed that I would not be available until 3:30pm that day because I would be relocating that day. Their customer service noted the information and told me there would be a representative calling me on June 23th's night to discuss about the specific delivery time. I had not received the phone call on June 23th. Instead, at 11:00pm ETS, I received an auto email saying my delivery time was scheduled at 12:30pm - 2:30pm the next day, during which time I would be on the flight as I told them one week earlier. I tried to contact them to reschedule, but the time was too late and customer service were off work. Therefore, I called the next day (June 24th)'s morning at 7:00am ETS, and told the customer service that I would be on the flight during 12:30pm - 2:30pm, and asked her to note to the delivery team to leave my items at the door. She said she did, and would ensure the delivery being left at my door. Again the customer service failed to keep their promises. I had not seen my mattress and foundation outside my apartment door. I was super disappointed and called the customer service again, and they criticized me not getting them informed about my schedule!!!!!!! After I argued that I told them both this morning and one week earlier, the customer service told me ""well, you should have called us earlier this morning. You called at 7:00 am and the truck was already out."" After I argued I called at 7:00 am ETS which was 4:00am in Seattle and I did not believe the truck was out at such early time, she changed the tune and criticized me for not being at home!!!! Well, I told them twice I would not be at home at that time, and asked them to leave the items at the door, and now I am the one to be criticized! Ridiculous. Now I have to sleep on the floor for 3 days until they redeliver it to me.Costco used to be a trustworthy company, but I am super disappointed this time. I did all I could to coordinate with the delivery, but they just showed no respect to me, and never kept their promises. And finally, they tried to blame me for the whole thing.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco.com + CEVA Logistics = NIGHTMARE,"I ordered a couch from Costco.com that was supposed to be delivered within 7-10 days. The order confirmation had a tracking number that displayed no results for over 3 weeks, then one day I received an automated call to schedule the delivery and so took the day off from work to be home to receive it (I was given an 8am-4pm window). I received a call from the delivery guy at 3:45p on the delivery day as he was having trouble finding my house - he asked me to confirm my address and the address he gave me was in Illinois - I live in MN! I provided him with my actual address and he said he would call me back. I received a call from a ""manager"" 10 minutes later saying they could not deliver the couch to my address as it didn't match what they had on file and that they'd need to call Costco to get approval for the ""change of address"", which they said would take at least 24 hours and the delivery would need to be rescheduled for another day. A couple more days go by and we don't hear anything. The wife calls Costco customer service and they basically give her the run-around for 2 hours and wouldn't let her speak with a manager. Eventually, I just told her to cancel the order and get a refund. Costco online is a JOKE!!!",0,1

WALMART has better service than costco and cheaper.Today, what they recommended to me is that they will reimburse me the money from three to five daysI see that their service is not of any quality, it is the worst thing that has happened to me, AMAZON or EBAY have better service than this.It is not possible that I buy it from them and they blame the Samsung company. I do not care, they have my money and my money is worth, and I have waited more than a month for the television that I bought on their page.They never made a call, they never sent an email.

Costco Wholesale,Costco.com is an absolute nightmare. DO NOT USE.,"Dealing w/ Costco.com has been an absolute nightmare. Here’s the sequence of events:1. Ordered iPad Air and keyboard on 5/18/20. Shipped to store (East Lyme, CT).2. Order arrived at store for pick up on 5/26. Only keyboard was in box; no iPad Air. Customer service called Costco.com. Supposedly a new one was going to be shipped immediately. Told I’d receive updates tracking info soon.3. Three days went by, no tracking info received. Contacted Costco.com. Was told again I’d receive updates tracking info soon. 4. Called next day because still no tracking info. Was basically told same thing as previous day.5. I think it was another couple days, still no tracking info. Called again and long story short, asked for refund. Put on hold. Guy came back and said all set, should see a credit within 3 business days. In the meantime (same day), I took a chance and made a separate order via Costco.com for another iPad Air (shipped to home this time)6. Received separately ordered IPad Air (much later than estimated reliever time!). Happy I got it BUT still have not received a refund for original order. Instead, Costco.com shipped the “replacement” to the store that was supposed to be cancelled! Went to store and they couldn’t even find!! Store called Costco.com and they said it wasn’t arriving at store for another couple days(?!?!) Store told me I was all set, I should see a refund within 2 business days. That was a week and a half ago! So now I’ve been paying interest on a $500 item for over a month that’s been “cancelled” numerous time. Costco.com is garbage. Never again.

Costco Wholesale,WARNING COSTCO IN COMMERCE MICHIGAN IS NOT PRACTICING SAFETY PROTOCOLS  AS STATED ON THEIR WEBSITE.,"WARNING: COSTCO IN COMMERCE TOWNSHIP MICHIGAN IS NOT FOLLOWING SAFETY PROTOCOLS AS STATED ON THEIR WEBSITE. Store management and staff are NOT practicing safety practices as promised on their website. I was there this past week. Many of the Staff were either not wearing masksat all (having them pulled down around their necks) or had them well below their nose. There were also many customers in the store with no masks. Not only that, but at the check out registers we were only a few inches from the customer at the next register checking out. All for promising social distancing. Shame on the manager for not following what there website clearly states. I chose to go to Costco for my first trip into a store rather than curbside pickup. I trusted their website to be accurate and truthful. SHAME ON THE STORE MANAGER! I spoke to what I was told was the store manager. She stated we do the best we can. Rules start from the top.

Costco Wholesale,Costco's Policies are Communistic,"Costco treats you like a criminal. You go through their checkout, they check your items at the exit. They took away their coffee grinder using Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse because they never really liked maintaining it. Now they make their customers wear masks, when everything is opening up and masks have been proven to be ineffective. I emailed the CEO and told him Americans are done with the psychological panic pandemic, the World Health Organization created to tank our economy, but he is only conerned about control and not about customers who reside in a free country. Well, Costco did not even require masks until recently. If they really cared about their customers, than why not require it at the beginning?Perhaps, doing business with the People's Republic of China has has had an effect on the management leaders of Costco and they have now become Communist in their way of thinking. I will not shop there anymore. I will support small business instead.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Now first I would like to start off by…Racist GM in Raleigh!!!!!!!,Now first I would like to start off by saying I have been a member of Costco for about ten years love the place. Except for it’s racist tendencies.have they shown the number of diverse persons of power in the company?My personal experience with its racist culture came into play 3 years ago when I took a job as a vendor.A very unpleasant experience and although posted in most places around store they say be respectful to vendors the are not. Case in point at store #645 in June 2018 as following guide lines I called store a week before coming for my event to let them know.Well when I arrived space was not set up so I had to wait for them to find a spot for me at that time the racist Gm walked by didn’t acknowledge me at all(which wasn’t expected since he didn’t last time I was there) So in them not having set up a spot for me I was behind setting up my display and up and running 15 mins before store opened. Now the whole time I was setting up that racist Gm kept walking past my display (I felt looking for fault (I had heard about them kicking vendors out but it had never happened to me)So after finishing my set up I noticed 2 white asst. managers watching me across the store of course pretending they are doing something else so after a while and selling two of my units I went on my first 15 min. Break now mind u I had been in store since 8:30 even thou my area was not set up an it was about 12:15 when I punched out for my first break after returning from break my display was backed up that fast and put in back.Like they were just waiting and when asked where my display was I was informed that I wasn’t behind my station enough upset as I was I left the store and went home. Talking to my manager and bawling my eyes out for being treated so horribly he said I never had a complaint in the year I had been with company and if they want to throw you out they will find a reason.I don’t feel like this racist Gm had a reason he did it because he could and the color of my skin was distasteful to him. I would suggest if that Gm is still there of which ever store he’s at people of color boycott until company holds this man accountable because I’m sure this isn’t the first complaint about racism and him.Do better Costco,0,2

Costco Wholesale,We ordered a refrigerator on Costco…,We ordered a refrigerator on Costco online. We first had to wait about a month for delivery. During that time there were never any updates and it was not until the day before and I found a number to call that we were told the delivery was going to be on the stated date. Then when the refrigerator was delivered we decided to decline delivery as the depth was too large for our manufactured home. The delivery men suggested that the return would be no problem and they had not even taken the refrigerator out of the box. They told me there would be no restocking fees and his Supervisor would call me to confirm that we refused delivery. Well we never got a call so we took it upon ourselves to go onto Costo.com and cancel our order as directed. We immediately received a verification that the order was cancelled and we would receive a refund within 3 to 7 days later. We received on notice that we received a refund but it was for the extended warranty that we got with the refrigerator. No refund was mentioned for the refrigerator. Then the problems started with customer service. Sent them numerous notices with no replies. Called many times with wait time of 93 minutes or more so did not hold for length of time. No response whatsoever from customer service. It is now over ten days since we cancelled the order and are still in limbo as to when the refund will be made. We are elderly and this kind of situation gives us much stress as the charge for the refrigerator is still on the credit card and increases the balance owed on it. I will never order a large item or major appliance from Costco again. The experience has been horrendous. If you could even get to talk to someone it would give us some relief.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Buy appliance one by one in different order otherwise you'll regret,"Just got off the phone with them after an absurd wait time over 30 minutes. That's when you try to call as soon as they open. If you call during the day the wait time will average between 90-120 minutes. While that's understandable with COVID in the play, the part that REALLY bothers me is their policy regarding to appliances cancellation with costco.com (Not sure if it's also true if you buy the items directly from their warehouse. We ordered a gas range and refrigerator which are both made by GE which is set schedule for delivery in 60 days, however, we wanted the item sooner but they can't accommodate which is fine by me. So we decide to cancel the range and keep the refrigerator. It can NOT be done?! Due to the fact that both item is from the SAME vendor so they can't just remove one item that was on the SAME po. HOW ABSURD. Also, they will only accept your cancellation request and inform you IF your request has been approved by them after 24-48 hours. If the item is either custom or special order I'm with them 100%, however, those are standard item they offer so the idea of us need their permission to cancel is just surreal. To be more specific, the order was placed on 5/31 for 7/30 delivery requesting the change on 6/13. Word of advise, if you want to shop appliance with them, your best bet is to place the order one by one just in case you have a change of heart. Lesson learned.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,ROTTEN CUSTOMER SERVICE. AVOID.,"Unreal. I ordered Egyptian Magic. Costco sent me half full jars with big air bubbles in them. I took a pic, and called Costco Online. I have now been on the phone over 2 hours to try to resolve this. Sent the pics to prove the point. Costco wants me to send it back (which they'll then dump) obviously to be sure I'm not trying to rip them off. Great, I'm high risk in the middle of a pandemic. They'll send a replacement order which will probably be from the same faulty batch (which happened once before.) So we'll keep going thru this routine a few times till they can send me full jars. Last time this happened, Costco simply replaced the product. I SAID TO THEM, I SAID TO THEM (someone has integrity here) thats not right, let's split the cost and we did, no problems. They have the notes from that call. (The replacement batch also had air bubbles BTW but I figured it worked out in the end.)I have no idea what has happened to Costco Online, but this has to be the hands down worst customer service I have ever experienced (outside of Spiritair).Now up to 2 1/3 hrs on the phone waiting to talk to a 'superior'. Asking a high risk person to go out in the middle of a pandemic for a product you wiil simply dump is beyond me. Spoke to the Tiffany the supervisor.

At this point (June 11th) the web page says that the items are being returned to Costco because ""recipient not available' which is silly, because we are still in lockdown and not going anywhere.

Not even the dam bald that said if you can pay they would pause payments for three months. Thank Costco definitely not giving my business to guys anymore! I was a member since 94 bye!,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costo.com Customer Service,I ordered a dishwasher from Costco.com on June 2nd and they said that it was estimated to be delivered on June 8th. Today is the 8th and the status is the same as when I placed the order. I waited on hold on the phone for over two hours to speak to someone and waited an hour to speak to someone on Live Chat. They told me that I would be contacted in the next 1-2 days to schedule a delivery. I sincerely hope this is true. I will update this review upon delivery.,0,2
Costco Wholesale,Horrible customer service for online…,Horrible customer service for online orders. In warehouse always been good. Not for online.

It’s my first time buying appliances from Costco online. Would NOT recommend!,0,1

After a week, I've not received these cards and stop by one of the warehouse locations for help. I've provided the order number to the customer service. She then calls the costco.com to verify and they said there was no such promotion. Then I asked to speak on the phone and ask to double-check and confirm. Again he said there was no such promotion. Now I've to go back and backtrack the promotion because I can't rely on them. Sure, I can call them (costco.com) directly from home but the hold is more than 120 minutes.",0,1

Today, without the receipt (my sister has it) I returned and expected to either get a Costco card or a refund credit for $10. Anyway, Costco processed my return for $6.51 as a refund credit on my credit card , I asked why not $10, the explanation was I bought same item more than 3 months ago on my member card with $3 discount, so the refund was offset against this transaction.I've been Costco member since 1994 and quite satisfied with its overall customer service, refund policy and product quality. My today return experience is petty but I'm little upset. I still think I should have received full refund $10 for the returned item.",0,2

Costco Wholesale,Online shopping with costco is frustrating at best,"I tried for days to buy some Clorox wipes online. It shows that they have the stock, but when I try to add it to my card it says it is not available for delivery in my zipcode that I should check back often because inventory changes frequently. So I spent a full day checking every 10-15 mins to see if I could buy it. After 4 hours of constantly checking, I was finally able to add it to my cart and check it out. The out of stock message returned after15 min again. so if I had not checked the site every 10-15 mins I would have missed it.It is unreasonable for Coscto to think that members will be checking the website every 10-15 mins until the stock is available for their zip code. I spent 4 hours on a pack of Clorox wipes.I am sorry but it has been a miserable experience shopping at Costco online. I do not understand the zip code quota for each product. if it is an online order, where I am placing it from should not matter!Clorox wipe product page has a note that says ""one per membership"". It is a very vague statement. Is it one per membership per day, or one per member per week, or it is one per membership and that is it, you cant buy more. A little clarification will be helpful.",0,1

The local repair shop eventually contacted me but requested a bill of sale.

Costco Wholesale,Costco.com is a rip off!! BEWARE,I just bought beach towels at Costco.com online. They were 2 for 28.99. I bought 15 sets for my rental property in FL and had them delivered to the rental property. When I went into my local MN Costco store - the exact same towels were 9.99 each. This means I paid $135 more for the online towels vs the price in the store(435-300). When I called Costco online - they would not give me an adjustment- they said the business relationships are separate and the vendors separate. This is a bold face lie. The store told me the item numbers were different so they wouldn’t give me a credit either. BEWARE - Costco online price gouges and hides under the lie that they have independent businesses so there pricing can be grossly different. In this case the online towels were 50% higher! I am done with Costco and their terrible service!,0,1

Costco Wholesale,New Worst Online Retailer has a Problem with Telling the Truth,"Costco Online actively engages in fraudulent and deceptive practices, and has been the absolute worst company from a performance and customer service standpoint. Despite being shown that they shipped orders that were made after ours and that their website is capable of inventory management and preventing over-ordering, they stuck with the pathetic ""everything goes out in the ordering is received"" and ""we are waiting on suppliers"". So I contacted the supplier, who confirmed that the item sold and charged in March is no longer being made (yes I have that in writing as well). So what does Costco do...lie and try the same pathetic excuses. They oversold, took money when they knew they were oversold, shipped out of sequence (lie or ineptitude), continue to lie about status and refuse to either send me the ""new"" model or refund my money. Pathetic company that charges for membership and the fails to deliver or follow the law. Buyer beware!",0,1

As a long time member, the store experience is very good. Ordering online is like the movie groundhog day with no resolution in sight. I've tried ordering the same laptop online with multiple valid credit cards and have always received a order cancellation with no specific explanation. After long waits and finally speaking to a live person, they can not give a reason why orders were cancelled. Item shows in stock. They suggested maybe billing address listed in costco online account is incorrect. Not so. I checked with my charge card issuers and they released funds for purchase to costco. Also, when order is cancelled costco does not release the hold amount for the charge card right away. Multiple phone calls required to clear this up and still no answers why orders were cancelled. This has got to be the worst online ordering experience in all my years. Unbelievable that the people responsible for overseeing the online ordering department has not addressed these problems. They are destroying business and any remaining goodwill. Be very careful and avoid at all possible cost to your sanity. Stick to the store's itself or use another vendor for online ordering.

Costco Wholesale,Online grocery orders cannot be cancelled,"I'm writing this review about costco online grocery orders. Costco needs to put a disclaimer at checkout about that they do not allow any grocery orders to be cancelled after being placed. I put an order in this week, normally on checkouts it asks for my cards 3 digit verification code. It did not, the order disappeared out of the cart completely. So I went to my account to see if it went through without the code. It was not showing in my orders. So I assumed it was deleted. Put another order in almost exactly the same from memory. It went through. I doubled checked my orders now both orders are showing. Waited on chat hold almost an hour to be told they cannot cancel grocery orders, even when there is a glick in there system. Told to refuse the shipment . How can that be done without knowing which shipment I am opening. So now I have 2 exact orders of goods. I will give the other order away to those in need. But totally frustrated with the lack of proper customer service. Told it was going to resolution in 1 to 2 days. But they shipped everything by then and have not heard from resolutions. So if you think your order did not go through wait and triple check otherwise you may have the same issue. My advice to Costco if they see this review, it is your obligation to make it clear on grocery orders at checkout that you are not allowed to cancel orders!!!. They would allow a return if I refused the shipment. But I would have had to refuse everything.so now I'm stuck paying for 2 orders because there system had a glick and pathetic customer service!!!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Stay away from Costco online!,"My review is of Costco online. I have been a loyal, longtime fan of the Costco warehouses- great prices, no hassle return, etcCostco online is a different story. I ordered plush rugs that went on sale a week later. When I called to get my sale price I was told twice by two different customer service girls, that they would adjust my price and put the difference back on my Visa. I waited and waited, no refund. I filled out the price refund on the site. Then I called back to speak to someone again and was told after maneuvering through prompts, that they are unable to take my call due to covid 19. ( no offer to callback or anything).Anyway, my advise is this- stick to the warehouse ( they are totally different) and if you do place an order on Costco online, only put one item on an order- because they will explain away any discount you would have got if you had just purchased the one item.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Terrible appliance delivery and install experience,"For the first time ever, my husband and I splurged and got all new appliances for our kitchen--our gas range had to be replaced, and every thing else was very old, so we decided to go big. Costco had deals on packages, with delivery, installation, and haul-off of old appliances included in the cost, so we ordered a Samsung package with gas range, over-the-range microwave, fridge, and dishwasher.The delivery and install service, XPO Logistics, was terrible. While they were punctual and polite, they should ONLY be in delivery and haul-off. Our two-person crew used power tools incorrectly and stripped out screws and bolts all over the place. Dishwasher is crooked and has a dent in the stainless, fridge has a drawer out of line with everything else, they didn't know how to hook up the gas line for the range, mounted a 60 lb. over-the-range microwave without anchoring to even one single stud, capped off two electrical wires in the same nut so that an electrical fire could have happened, and when they had to take our front door of the hinges, they put it back on without testing it. It wouldn't even close, and again, screws were stripped out to the point that we could barely get them out to fix the door.That's not even everything, but you get the point. We tried to call to get them back out here. Their phone system would have you spend an hour or more simply trying to get someone to talk to who knows what to do. And Costco has not been helpful in navigating this. Eight days after initial delivery, my husband and my neighbor have had to complete the range install, redo the microwave mount, and we're still waiting on everything else. I will never order appliances from a big box store again, no question. And if anyone ever tells me they use XPO Logistics for their deliveries, I'm backing out. Terrible customer service and employee training.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Horrible customer service and delivery experience,"I live in the Sacramento area and ordered a 6 piece bedroom set from Costco.com for about $3,000. It took about 3 weeks to receive which was fine. However Costco uses a third party delivery service called Metropolitan Warehouse and Delivery. This delivery company delivered the main dresser broken, and claimed zero responsibility for the damaged item. Costco sent me a replacement about a month later, and the same delivery company delivered the new dresser. The second dresser was also broken, and the company again tried to claim zero responsibility for the damaged item, and was extremely difficult to work with. I like Costco’s products but I feel that they need to stop working with this delivery company. I will not order another Costco product while they use this delivery company.

Costco Wholesale,"Really slow shipping, item damaged","I love Costco, so this is tough to write, but my entire purchasing experience for my gun safe has been ridiculous.I wanted to use my sizable Costco Citi Visa rebate to buy a safe at Costco. So we head over, our Costco is out of safes, and, you cannot use your Citi rebate online, so, they give me cash for my rebate and tell me to take it to my bank, then charge the purchase to my Costco Citi card online, then pay my bill with the rebate money. Okay, kind of a pain, and honestly, I don’t even remember the last time I was inside my bank. But I need the safe, so, no worries. I ordered the safe using my Costco Citi card, on April 19, with 7-10 days shipping...... May 3 I get a call saying it will arrive in my town May 4 and they will call to set up a time to deliver... I figure that they have my number because they’ve called me once, I confirmed that was my number, give them a back up number and so I wait..... no calls for 14 days..... on May 17 I dig through my call log and find the number that originally called me, and call them. They tell me that my order has just arrived in town, and someone will call later in the day to set up an appointment, nobody called. 7:45 the next morning a man calls to tell me he needs to set up an appointment for that day to drop off the safe as his driver is in town, I try to get a time out of him, or suggest one, and he’s an ass. I suggest around 12:00 thinking I can arrange that, I’ve got an appointment but I’ll make it work, he proceeded to lecture me about his drivers time. Finally he says between 11:00-1:00, (fine, whatever.) he then asks if I still want the driver to call ahead. (Yes! I have stuff to do) Anyway, the driver calls me at 10:00 saying he’s on his way, (that’s nice, I’m at work.) So, I tell him I can be there in 15 minutes. I get home, the driver is super nice, but, he’s got his whole family in the truck! Not super professional, but these are weird times. He then tells me that the safe has been sitting in their warehouse for at least ten days, because he didn’t have my phone number..... WHAT??? The freight company called me on my number, and I gave them a back up number. So, I sign for the safe. After my hubby gets home, we drag it into the house, take off the packaging and it’s damaged. Not a tiny dent mind you, a weld is broken. I spend two hours waiting for Costco on chat just to be told that the safe is out of stock and they don’t know when it will be back in. So, they will have the freight company (the same one,) contact me in 5-7 days to pick up my safe. Then, in 3-6 days I will get a refund, and when the safe is back in stock, I can order another one, that will come with the same freight company. No thanks! So, I asked for a price adjustment, I wanted the safe now to keep my grandkids safely away from our guns, I wasn’t really worried about thieves, so a safe with a broken weld will have to do because I need it now, not when the grandkids are in college! I got $80 back on a $500 order. I’m not impressed with Costco Online for large items. I wanted to order a new fridge, but I’m afraid of what I’d get",0,2

It was reported by the news that big companies like Costco that there toilet paper stock levels are adequate. I have been trying during the times I explained and never was able to purchase 1 package during this time.When I became a Executive Member, for 4 years I have not been able to receive my rebate check on time, I would have to get Corporate Office to cut another check and they would send it to my residence 3 more times.This time I have Costco Membership at my local location.

I told my wife that, unlike other stores, I expected that Costco would be as concerned with their 4 p.m. shopper as they were with their 10 a.m. shopper. I was right! Instead of waiting in line in the wee hours of the morning, I went in about 2 p.m. It looked like they restocked the floor around 1:00. They did NOT put everything out in the morning & let the guy getting off work at 4:00 hang out to dry. They restocked the store for their later customers. All the ground meat, even toilet paper. In the afternoon most other stores had various empty shelves but Costco was concerned about both you AND me!!!",0,5

I also have a credit and it will not let me use it online I'm truly annoyed.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,I went to Costco in Paradise Valley,"I went to Costco in Paradise Valley, Phoenix AZ to pick up a refill on a vital prescription that I was out. I wouldn't have run out, but the CostCo pharmacy had to order it the day before.The issue is that they require a face covering to enter the store. They had been giving out masks but I was told they no longer were doing that. SO I asked isn't there a way I can get this prescription? I told her I was out. The greeter pretty much said sorry it's policy.So I called the pharmacy and asked what I could do. They said pretty much anything that covers your face would qualify, a sock, a t-shirt, a hanky. SO I said fine, I'll pull my tshirt up over my face while I am in the store.They said no, that won't do. So apparently HOLDING a loose t-shirt ,over your face is fine, but pulling one up over your face is not.I understand these are unusual times, but concessions have to be made, especially when there is no hard evidence that ""anything that covers your face will do"" has any effect whatsoever on keeping the virus in check. CostCo seems more interested in protecting their liability than in the health of their customers and offers no solutions to get necessary medication other than ""sorry"". They could have offered to bring it up to me as I waited but that was not on the table",0,1

I understand that it is a horrible situation we are in right now and things are different but I am getting tired of everyone blaming everything on this virus. If the basketball hoop was in stock when I ordered it I expect to get it and of it is out of stock then I should be told way before 30 days that you are out of stock.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Trying to Return a Television,"I purchased a large screen television from Costco.com. My television stopped worked.....black screen and no audio. 90 days had already passed, so I could not return it to a Costco store. I contacted Costco Tech Support/Concierge Service. After troubleshooting over the phone, I was told that my television could not be repaired, and I was transferred to the Escalation Dept. I was told that they would send me an email with a return label so that I could send the television back to Costco.com for a full refund. I have yet to receive an email, and I call every day trying to get someone to send me a return label. I don't have a vehicle large enough to take it to a Costco store, and I am pretty sure they will not take it back because of their 90-day return policy. I do have a 2 years warranty, but Costco online doesn't care about providing good customer service. I think Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Sam's Club all provide better customer service than Costco.com",0,1
Costco Wholesale,I drive a good deal,"I drive a good deal. 65000 miles annually. Whenever I can, I stop at Costco for gas fill ups. The prices are always much lower than the gas stations in the the surrounding areas. Of equal importance to me, I get on average 2-3 MPG more when I use Costco's Kirkland fuel. I have researched the make up of the gas, but could not find a specific or scientific reason for this. In gas alone, I save a substantial amount of my membership fee. Plus, I usually get around $85 cash back annually. It is also a joy to be free to stop at any one of the Costco Stores and find basically the same products and store layout. the only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is it is difficult to find someone to ask a question of.",0,4
Costco Wholesale,Update from (2) days ago,"Update from (2) days ago. Dropped costco, the timing resulted in getting the $60 membership returned. Saw an email for a $45 / free membership at the local samsclub - was a member more than a decade ago. Online sign-up was easy, no mandatory masks but I always ware one, they have several self-check out lines. The people (employees and customers) very nice. The store is same in size, clean, well arranged and they have pretty much the same stuff. Their selections in a few areas are better / expanded. I spent 2 stress free, casual hours there scoping out the store. Spent $600, plus $57 online. Will return next week for approx. $300 more in things I didn't get on my first run. I will certainly make this store a main component in getting much needed consumer goods. There are areas that Costco does a better job in but not enough to have to deal with public retail managers and employees that are allowed to run around a business unchecked in how they deal with (all) customers. Many companies have been smart enough to sure this up a long time ago and have profited. Costco seems to continue to allow these selfish, uncaring sometimes hateful attitudes thrive and fester at many of their stores.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Mask Mandate,"I live in Huntsville, AL. At a time when businesses are opening up, Costco decides to mandate mask wearing in their Huntsville store. We are no more at risk for catching Covid19 than we are the seasonal flu and both have the same recovery statistics. This is a control tactic that I and many others will not participate in. There are plenty of stores that will appreciate my business while you take a political stand on the Covid19, because what you are doing is not based upon science or facts.",0,1

Also they send emails daily wanting you to purchase specials online, but who would with it taking so long to ship an item.

Costco Wholesale,Poor service at your entrance.,"Due to the fact that costco customer service email is not accepting mail maybe they will read this......I would like to share my experience I had while at your Lantana Fl Warehouse today (5/3/20 at approximately 3:10pm). First I have been a customer for almost 20 years and have had good service from your employees as a frequent this store often. As well as many others I understand the current circumstances regarding how your loyal customers are supposed to enter your store. Today I was waiting in line like everyone else for about 20 minutes. As I was following the people in front of me I was paying attention to the employee at the entrance and his instruction. The gentleman in front of me began to walk inside but stopped to ask a question of the employee, this caused me to stop. At this point another employee that I was not aware of rushed towards me putting his hand toward my chest and very sternly instructed me to stop. As he stood face to face from me staring at me his attitude and demeanor was completely unprofessional. He would tilt his head muttering a phrase “I appreciate you…I appreciate you”… He stood staring me down for about 20 seconds then instructed me to go on. This employee seemed to believe that he was some type of authority figure similar to a law enforcement officer. This experience has completely transformed my opinion of your store. I was close to walking over to customer service and canceling my membership. Instead I proceeded to purchase my item. On my way out I talked to a manager and he said ""he would mention it”. This situation would have been completely avoided IF there was ONE person clearly giving instructions and not multiple persons. Your customers will follow directions if it is clearly given. I hope that someone reads this and gives it consideration. If I was lead to feel this way than countless other customers have this feeling as well.",1,1

Costco Wholesale,Poor customer service,"Like many people “If I could leave ZERO stars, I would”. I was treated here by staff by the upmost DISRESPECT. Currently a First Responder for the FDNY I asked the staff member if they still allowed priority access. I showed my ID and was asked “Do you work for the hospital?” Confused I replied “No, my title on my ID says FDNY EMT”. His response in return was “That’s not a First Responder I can’t let you in, speak to the manager”. Luckily the manager was close to the entrance and let me in. I entered cosco forgetting they’re enforcing the policy to wear a mask. Once my shopping was done and my food was purchased at the food court, I was filling up soda when a staff worker approached me and my roommate (WHO ALSO IS A FIRST RESPONDER) that we had to leave immediately. I kindly asked to finish filling my drink and I would leave. He granted that and as I filled my drink yet ANOTHER worker approached me. He told me I had to leave immediately yet again. I defended myself and said how his co-worker just stated that I was allowed to fill my drink. He denied me re-entering with a mask and ESCORTED me and my friend to leave cosco.

Impossible to reach by phone, help section about orders did not resolve the issue, and on line chat took 40 minutes to chat with someone and the bailed on me while I was typing and this was not a lost connection and when they were chatting they were giving conflicting advice.Then I email Costco about this and here is the reply I received: Our Member Service Center is committed to providing real-time assistance via chat or phone. As a result we will no longer be responding to requests via email. We look forward to serving you!.I called the phone line only to be told by an auto attendant after 10 minutes on hold.. that I needed to call again later and was hung up on And I already had a terrible chat experience.

It took Costco 18 days to get some of the items but that wasn't the problem, it was unable to cancel and the online chat was 30+ minutes wait.

Costco Wholesale,"No Mask, No Business","I am also one who is terribly disappointed in Costco’s decision to enforce their mask policy. We have been Executive members for many years and spend thousands of dollars with them annually. My wife and I both refuse to wear one, instead practicing good social distancing and controlling any coughing and/or sneezing in public. We feel Costco’s policy is not only absurd, but we believe they are simply doing this to increase store hours and allow more people in their stores. It’s about increased revenue and not safety for its members and employees. If they are so concerned about safety and protecting us from this horrible virus, why are they waiting until next Monday to begin enforcing this ridiculous policy? Answer: to drive customers into their warehouses in mass this coming weekend!We also have a Sam’s Club membership and will be giving them 100% of our business.

I had always been interested in getting a membership and finally did so. I purchased it online and went into the store where the first gentleman asked to see my card, so I pulled out my phone and showed him the email and he said ok go in. (Mind you, he very well could have said please go to the membership desk first to retrieve your membership card and complete the process). So I’m shopping and go to checkout and lady at the self checkout came over after I was having difficulty scanning my items. She said scan your membership card (again, pulled out my phone and used the email I received as no one mentioned getting a physical card from the membership desk) and I scanned it and it scanned and said international. She said we don’t accept international memberships. I said no ma’am I just purchased this membership online. It’s the $60 one. She had me scan my phone again and it still said international and she said we don’t accept international here so you can’t be here. Again, I explained this is a brand new membership that was purchased online. Only then did she ask to see the email and after reviewing sent me to the membership desk for my membership card. I went back to complete my checkout and kept inserting my card and it kept saying remove card but not doing anything further. She comes over again and says we only accept MasterCard if it’s debit not credit so you can’t use that. Then walks away again. I really enjoyed the store and products itself. But the employees are extremely rude and made for a horrible first visit. I can assure you, I won’t renew my membership again. I did fine without it before and the way the employees treated me is a sure sign I won’t support the business after this membership expires.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Bad Customer Service,"I went to the Costco in Kennewick WA 04/26/20 just after 10am. The parking lot was packed.Due to the Covid-19 I thought maybe there would be a line & drove by the front & saw people just walking in (no line). Due to a bad knee & foot, I was happy to see no line so I wouldn't have to stand around (bad enough I knew I would have to stand in line to check out). So I parked my car, took a shopping cart from the cart return area in the parking lot & headed towards the entrance of Costco only to be confronted by an woman employee who took my cart from me & told me I had to go down the side of the store where they had carts that had been sanitized. Okay, so I go to get one of those carts where a man employee handed me one.But then the woman employee who told me to get the ""sanitized cart"" before, than grabs that cart from me & tells me I had to go to the end of the line which there was no line.... it was people getting carts from the other end & were about 5 car lengths down the side of the building walking towards the entrance. There was no barricades to form any lines coming into the building & there was ""NO LINE"". If I had seen a line, I would have not even tried to shop this day.Needless to say I walked back to my car & left. Do to this woman employee's rudeness & the fact that there was no barricade indicating there was a line, I am VERY unhappy with the company.I have been a long time Costco Member & have never been treated so rudely. I will be trying to go back during senior hours during the week & if it happens again, I won't be renewing my membership.User's recommendation: Costco is not customer friendly during Covid -19.Update: Received a phone call from Costco in Kennewick WA in reference to my complaint. Be aware that Costco doesn't believe in putting up signs in the front of their store advising customers that the line to get into the store starts way back down the side by the automotive area. The only people that are allowed to walk directly in are first responders. I don't understand why they don't advise this (at least post a sign in the front) BEFORE a customer parks their car & walks to the front of the store. Great way to loose my business & I won't be back.",0,1

Which was a slap to the face so i tried calling the number/numbers i found on the internet and be hold to no avail they aren’t excepting any calls they disabled the online chat and when you call the store it just rings and rings and rings no one picks up i tried canceling the order because i went on apple.com and just ordered it from them directly and actually got the nike plus edition the one i wanted so i was happy with it now comes the part where i am trying to cancel the order for the watch from costco but on there online it doesn’t tell you or on there automated call how to cancel an order that hasn’t shipped yet it won’t let you cancel it until it ships which is stupid on all levels if it didnt leave your warehouse yet why not let it get canceled so its easier for costco because they dont have to do any work on preparing it or sending it out I understand that the warehouse sometimes doesnt carry the item and gets it shipped directly the manufacturer which they should say so that way we might have a chance to contact the manufacturer and cancel it ourselves but NOOO thats extra work for an already frigged up system and it still says order partially shipped on there app when you check order status and doesn’t give you any other updates on when its gonna come 10 days later and 5days after i was supposed to get it I ordered the apple watch directly from apple on 4/25 and its coming on 4/28 i just wanna receive the item so i can return it myself or when i get an update in email with the tracking number to call ups and tell them return to sender but that will prob make matters worse and costco prob won’t know what to do because clearly there online system is shot to shi t i just hope they fix it soon because e i dont want others to go through the hassle and headache that i have sustained i am a member at bj’s and costco and dont want this to ruin my praise for Costco because i enjoy going there but idk if ill ever order online from them again with all of these bad reviews maybe its time to listen to your customers and take action change your online system IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME so please please get your shi t together thank you,0,1

Costco Wholesale,Very bad experience,"Since I am not feeling well, I had to send my son to the Costco with my membership card. The lady at the counter, she was not letting my son to use the membership card, both my son and I have the same last name., still she made such a big deal and acting like she owns the store. And she did not scan a bunch of banana and at the exit, they stopped him as if he stole a bunch of banana worth $1.99, and he had to go back to the line. This lady was so rude and arrogant, very first time I have this very bad experience from Costco at sugar and, Texas. Always I thought their customer service is great! Such a shame. I called the store to complain about this incident and whoever on the other end, didn't even apologize for their mistake. I am from Sugarland, Texas. I spent a lot of money in Costco every year shopping. I should stop going to this place, where they don't take care of their members. There should be a consistency when these people let others use the membership card. I knew many people use friends/neighbors' membership cards. I sent my son with my card, not any friends or neighbors. I hope and pray no one gets this kind of customer service. I am heartbroken from how my son got treated.",0,1

I canceled my order today and in small print, as I canceled, the website stated that 2 day shipping could take 14+ days to receive.

Costco Wholesale,Delivery delays and no help,"Ordered 2 in stock grocery items 3/27 for 2 day delivery. Got email they were shipped 3/31 with UPS tracking label for 4/2 delivery. Costco billed my credit card when shipped. A week later I see banner online items taking 5-6 days now. The 4/2 delivery date now gone from my account and shipment then says processing. UPS tracking still says waiting package. No update from Costco. I waited another week contacted chat and after waiting 90 minutes the only info I could get was that it was processing. Yeah, I saw that. Contacted chat again 4/13 and waited for the 3300 people ahead of me and got little information. Agent said they would refund me or re-ship. Since they agreed they couldn’t tell me when I would actually receive the reshipment I agreed to a refund. They said it would take 2-3 business days. Those 2-3 days have come and gone. I am still waiting for the refund. Meanwhile my online order says it is still “processing” and my 3/27 order clearly has gone well beyond the new shipping info on Costco.com of 17 business days. So Costco you took my money, said the items were shipped. They never were and no one knows where it’s at. Costco’s total lack of communication is unacceptable. If you can’t handle orders right now then stop taking them until you figure it out. Most companies by now have figured it out. I ordered the same items elsewhere while waiting for your delivery and got them in less than 2 days. I will probably have to contact the credit card company and dispute your charge since my delivery is nowhere. You were quick to take my money and email that they shipped but have no process in place to keep people updated. And today I see the chat option removed from your site. Who wants to wait on the phone for no help.",0,1

During covid 19, I wanted to stock up. It was easier to join BJs online. Pretty much instant use of the membership with BJs online and crazy fast delivery. Get your act together Costco.

Costco Wholesale,Costco.com—The WORST experience with online shopping…,"Worst experience with online shopping EVER. I have four (4) separate orders that have been in my account with the “RECEIVED” designation for 20 days. I have tried to cancel them but obviously they can’t do it. I spent on hour on the phone talking to them. The woman was so dismissive and rude I was floored. After an hour of hemming and hawing she says that the orders really were placed with Instacart. I said— that’s impossible I placed them ONLINE to be Shipped. This response should have told her AGAIN that I was calling about online orders. But she choose to ignore Me and kept on saying ‘May I finish please” like a school teacher to a second grade student. So what does she do? She transfers me to Instacart who proceeded to tell me that they only handle orders that have been shopped for in the warehouse with their grocery delivery service. That’s exactly the same thing I told my Costco school teacher 1/2 hour before this. And for all this, the prices of my online items were inflated and I had to pay $3 per item for shipping. So here I am hat- in-hand begging for my items to be canceled since it’s been 3 weeks since I placed the order. I can’t get through to the chat. The number for Costco.com us non-functioning. I really believe they don’t have a clue how to cancel orders placed online. I hope Costco is reading this. I have ordered products from Samsclub.com, BJs.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Costco.com. All but Costco can get the products I ordered to me. All but Costco can be reached by phone. And all but Costco.com know how to run an online site.Update: It has now been 23 days since I placed my orders. The website is STILL showing RECEIVED for each order but nothing has shipped. I’m talking about 4 orders and none have shipped. None! Today Is Saturday April 25. I placed my orders on April 2nd. If I don’t get a tracking number for each of my purchases by Friday May 1st im going to file disputes on each order with my credit card company. Everyone should do that! File disputes for orders not shipped!!When it hurts Costco’s bottomline maybe they will either cancel orders or send the merchandise.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,"So far my worst online grocery experience. 5-6 days delay turned into 16 days, Useless chat support.","So far my worst online grocery experience.This is a review for online only. I love Costco for in-store but refuse to go there at this time because they are simply not keeping customers and staff appropriately safe with distancing. I ordered some items, said 5-6 days delivery (their two day option). Ten days later, nothing. No update on order. Did the chat support and there were 2500 ahead of me! Said it would be 50 minutes. That turned into about 3 hours (would normally not wait, but I was working on the computer anyway). Finally got someone who had no answers about when it would ship. Asked why the website STILL said 5-6 days. She hadn't a clue. Even asked her if she could forward my complaints and said no, that I should use the feedback link on the site. So a totally useless, time wasting ""support"" experience.Two days later, I received an email saying it would ship in 2-4 days. In the end, it took 16 DAYS to receive the order. That they don't update your order with estimated shipping status is inexcusable.Now their website is updated to say a 14 day delay. No thanks, Costco.

Costco Wholesale,Customer service was originally designed to be five-star -- but that was a long time ago.,"Customer service was designed to be world-class when Costco opened. Somehow, something went wrong and very, very bad. First, the 100% satisfaction guarantee was quietly pulled years ago and no longer exists. Second, getting a refund on a return has become a totally subjective, arbitrary process based on random factors like how much you smile or how well you interact with the return clerk. If produce was bad, you have to return at least half of it, regardless that Costco sells in huge portions. So, if I eat half of a five-pound something on day 1 and the other half spoils on day 2, I'm stuck, regardless if industry standards state that the whole should not have spoiled until day 7.And, my office used my Costco account to shop for my entire law firm at Costco, racking up hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars each week for food for our kitchen's chef and other supplies. I got discriminated against because I would rightfully return spoiled items, and incredibly was told that the Costco staff would cancel my membership since I had a high pattern of returns. Sure, when I bought $50,000.00 to $70,000.00 of groceries each year plus supplies there as compared to someone who buys $5,000.00, I was bound to return more items!I could go on but will share only the above examples.

DO NOT ORDER anything from Cost-Co online. I wish I could give them 0 stars.Update on the above: My order finally came 10 days after I placed it. It came in a box that was twice the size needed. My items had been tossed in willy nilly, and 3 layers of packing bubbles had been thrown in on top. There was still at least a foot of empty space above the packing materials. A package of bacon bits had broken open, and the bits were scattered throughout the box. But worst, everything was filthy. Not just dusty and covered with bacon bits, but muddy. It looked like each item had been dragged through mud before being thrown in the box. NOT OK. I repeat, do not order from Cost-Co online.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Massive inconvenience,"Yesterday my cousin and I did our shop at Costco, Epping. We spent over $1000 between the two of us. We went through the check outs separately, so it was easy for the workers to do their job. My cousin bought 3 bottles of Jack Daniels and told the checkout worker she would like 2 bottles of Gentleman Jack as they weren’t on the shelves. The worker processed her request and she went on to pay for her shopping. She was told she’d need to head over to the guy in the vest at the counter to collect the Gentleman Jacks. My cousin went over to the desk, gave the worker her receipt and advised she was there to collect the 2 bottles of Gentleman Jack. The staff checked and ticked off the receipt, handed her the bottles and off we went. We obviously had our receipts and trolleys both checked before we were allowed out the store and so this happened, all okay. Today I received a phone call from a man who worked at the store advising we had been given an extra bottle of the alcohol by mistake. I had no idea what he was talking about as we did pay for what we purchased? So I was a little confused. I told the man it wasn’t actually me who bought the alcohol and therefore I’d get my cousin to call him back on the number he called me on, all was well with that however he did mention that he’d be putting a note on my account and that I was responsible as it was my membership (completely understand) however felt a little accused of stealing at this point..I contacted my cousin who then spoke to this man and explained her side of the story. He persisted to say we have this on footage which was fine as she wasn’t denying anything, however as far as she was aware she didn’t know she only paid for 1 bottle. Costco emailed us a copy of the receipt and it was correct that there was a mistake made not only by one person but by THREE people in the store.We went through the check out, over to the desk where the man looked over the receipt and we got checked on our way out.What a complete shambles this has turned out to be!We are completely happy to pay for the item if it wasn’t paid for that is not the problem, our problem sits with the responsibility of the Costco staff who are supposed to check over receipts for not only people stealing but obviously for HUMEN ERROR also.I’m pretty disappointed that you guys had the nerve to “PLACE MY MEMBERSHIP ON HOLD” for a mistake that was made not by us but by the staff at Costco. We were completely understanding of the circumstances however were just annoying it was missed not once by multiple times.There was no apology what’s so ever either which is even more disappointing.Regretful decision heading to Costco and spending the amount we did for this to all happen today. #RANTOVER",0,3

Are they doing anything at all to restock items? I check every morning (eastern time) and the situation has not changed at all.

One weekend after we checked out at the cashier, about to go to our car, one tall, huge ball headed white man called Jay the warehouse manager approached us and stopped us as if he is police and held us against our will for over one hour, questioning my husband in a very degrading way, threatening him as if he did anything wrong, questioning him as if he is a criminal just because he is a black man. My husband is more than this Jay in every way of life, shape or form, but my husband kept his cool. I believe his aim was to aggravate my husband so that my husband can react so that he can call the police on him, as a form of intimidation. He was totally condescending towards my husband, me and my son got afraid of him, and at the same time I felt so ashamed as a white woman the way he was treating my husband just because he is a black.

Costco Wholesale,DO NOT use Costco to have granite…,"DO NOT use Costco to have granite installed in the state of Florida. The company they use International Granite is the worst and the support from Costco is just as poor. Costco should be ashamed of them selves for referring such an unprofessional company. We flew down the night before the installation as we were to be the first stop in the morning. They showed up at 3:00 P.M. Thursday 01/16/20. We were sold special metal brackets for support. During installation I watched them place the granite over loose brackets and then proceed to glue the brackets to the bottom of the granite (NO Support). It was now 7:15 P.M. when they finished up and left. We were told not to put anything on the counters for 24 hours. My wife and I were looking at the counters and when I bent over to see the brackets I discovered a 6 inch crack in the wall that they said nothing about. The next morning I called International Granite, the job supervisor said she would call back and never did. I waited until 1:00 P.M. to call her again 3 times, she said she would have the manager call me back, he never did. I called 2 more times with no results, so I finally called Costco. They got the manager to call me and he said they would come back next Thursday. I told him that was no good we were leaving he said he would call me Monday to see what he could do. Over the week end we noticed the whole counter was loose. I asked him to send different people to have the counter installed properly. He agreed to come on Tuesday but they sent the same guy, now with an attitude. He was going to just lift up the counter, glue it down not fixing the brackets. I was ready to throw him out when he agreed to lift the whole counter back off and re install it properly. I have video that they were not glued down. The last problem was the sink they sold us a bill of good on as one that did not stain. You can clean it with stainless steel cleaner and it has water spots immediately. When we called International Granite the job supervisors number was disconnected. Costco called on 2/12/2020 to see if International Granite made arrangements to make good on the sink, I said NO.The Costco representative said she would call back later that day or by Friday. It is now the following Tuesday 2/18/2020 and I had to call Costco. The woman I spoke to said there have been no notes since 2/12/2020 but she will have someone from special orders call me. It is now 6:30 at night and no call. All this inconvenience and still no resolution one month later. I can not begin to tell you how frustrated I am with Costco and their unprofessional behavior.

As a result we will no longer be responding to requests via email. We look forward to serving you!Customer By Service Email (Cynthia Cole) (02/12/2020 04:15 PM) Earlier today, February 12, we stopped at the Costco tire center at the Rancho Cordova, CA location to inquire about replacing the tires on our car and to ask about the advertised sales in your latest brochure. We asked about a quote to replace the tires and about the sales going on. Frederick (Fredrick, not sure of the spelling) at the counter was condescending and dismissive. He gave us a current price quote per tire and when we questioned him about other possible deals, we said something to the effect that “Well, I’ll be glad to charge you ladies fifty dollars more per tire at the full price if that is what you want.” We don’t put many miles on our vehicle per year and all we were trying to ascertain was whether there was another tire with a lesser mile warranty (he quoted an 80 thousand mile warranty tire), that was perhaps a little less expensive. He kept his demeaning “you women don’t know anything about tires” attitude and we became upset. He said, ”Do you want to talk at my supervisor” (his words) and when we replied in the affirmative, he went to the shop area door, gave a loud whistle and yelled, “hey – these women want to speak to a supervisor;” at which time we could hear someone else from the shop area reply, “eeew, they want to speak to a supervisor,” in a high-pitched voice accompanied by laughter by the employees. This indicated to us that apparently, this happens quite often. Xavier the supervisor was not much better as he approached us laughing and didn’t seem interested in our complaint about the counter guy. We had some words with him in one of the bays and were basically dismissed.All it would have taken from either of these guys would have been, “we apologize if you felt that we were speaking down to you, it was not intentional and we are sorry. Here is the best deal we can give you for a set of four tires if you buy them today.” Ta DaThe whole confrontation could have easily been avoided had either of these men had any idea about customer service. Needless to say, we will never buy tires from Costco and at every opportunity, will tell everyone we are able to about the rude, condescending treatment received. Especially our female friends.

Costco Wholesale,Poor customer service!,"I've had Costco executive membership for several years but yesterday(2/11) when I went to return a comforter set that I had bought, the cashier Isenia R. Treated me like a thief! As I was returning it she opened up the bag where the comforter came in (I hadn't opened it) and she stated that the pillow shams were missing and I told her they must be in there because I hadn't opened it. The customer behind me stated that she had bought one and the shams were in between the comforter the cashier snapped at the customer and told her she knew where they were and they should be at the top. I told her to forgetting I was taking the comforter home I didnt need to be accused of stealing two pillow shams. She said to wait a minute the manager was on the way. When the manager came the cashier was still making drama because the pillow shams were not at the top of the bag and the costumer behind her told again that the pillow shams was in between the comforter the cashier ignored the customer and the manager apologized and said that the cashier was only doing her job and I told him that if she was doing her job she would check between the comfortater like the customer behind me had told her to do multiple times all she was doing was accusing me of stealing. I told both of them 3 times to return me the bag because I didn't need to steal two shams from Costco. I'm not sure what her problem was but she needs to check thoroughly before accusing people of stealing as the shams were actually between the comforter. This happened at Potomac mills store #626 in Woodbridge, VA so I will definitely avoid doing my shopping there!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,"LIFETIME VERTICAL SHED…bad, bad, bad experience","I bought a P LIFETIME VERTICAL SHED that I would keep in my yard with some tools. It was dispatched without hardware. I Contacted Costco and they told me to contact the provider. I contacted the ""provider"" and they told me that they will send me the hardware once they arrive because they are sold out and that this will take between 1 and 3 months. Then I contacted COSTCO and they sent me a new product and they told me that the initial product will be picked up by UPS and that they will contact me, never they called and nobody did anything in COSTCO to find a solution. Three months later I get and email where they tell me that since I did not return the product they will charge it to my credit card. I informed them that this product was in my garage waiting for UPS. Finally I have to put that box in my car (quite large and heavy) and take it to the store because they never picked it up. I had never had an experience with a purchase like this time. Today I get other email where they said they appreciate my membership and the balance was zero.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco cutting corners by laying off an already space employee crew ):,"We have been shopping at Costco since it was PriceClub. They have always shorted cashier's so expect it to take longer to get through the line. But now, they added self checkout which is 3 self checkouts on either side of one aisle....you 'get' to cut in front of people to go to an open station and park your cart diagonally as there is basically the same space for 6 new self check out lines in what would have been 2 regular lanes. It takes longer to manuever everything and do it all yourself. If you have 1 or 2 items it's great but not for a cartload. I spoke to the manager at the Orange Grove and Thornydale Tucson location about it and she said she really thinks as customers learn how to scan and do the work themselves it will get easier and easier. We are NOT a fan and found that the regular checkout actually took less time even though no matter what, you have to wait",0,2

Costco Wholesale,Costco in Danville,"Costco in Danville, CaSome cashiers are definitely people haters. Its really sad they have to express their hates toward certain non white customers while doing their cashier jobs. I have friends who also shop at the same location sharing the same bad experience. After hearing those negative experience from my Asian wife and friends, I was looking around and observed the behavior of the cashiers there at Danville Costco whenever I was in line for cashier. The hater cashiers acted really friendly to white customers, and changed their friendly face to a stern or a little angry face when serving non white customers. Yes, those haters are white as well. With their stern face, there's no greeting, but a subtle angry behaviors, throwing my stuff from the cart to the conveyor. I and my friends did nothing wrong to these haters. Deep inside their heart, they probably hate me so much for whatever the reason, they probably want to kill me and my friends. Watching this scene is a norm at this Costco Danville, Ca. Today I became the victim of the hater cashier, and I made a complaint to the manager there. I expect nothing would be changed there even after the complaints after complaints. Probably the manager there don't care about my feeling and my friends'. Its sad I probably go back there when I run out of eggs and vegetables because of their close proximity. I'm going to have a small go pro like camera with me from now on when I shop there and catch those hate images. And I recommend other people who experience the same bad treatment to join me collecting the images.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,In December of 2019,"In December of 2019, I went to Costco wireless to upgrade 3 of my phones and get the $300 gift card promo they were running at the time. They did not have the phones, so I paid the taxes and they ordered the phones. When the phones got to my house, 2 were the wrong ones. So, I went into Costco and they said they had to reorder them. So, I paid the taxes again and they reordered the phones. They informed me that a return label will be emailed to me and the taxes I paid in the first order will be refunded. I made sure to ask if I would still be eligible for the promotion they were offering in which they replied YES. Everyone was very nice and accommodating at this point. After a while I called again about the refund/return label and they informed me it was PROCESSED and I will get the refund and the label was emailed. That’s when the problem started when I called back and asked about the refund and the label, they kept on telling me that is was processed and I would be getting it. As of today, this has not happened yet. So, I called many times and asked for a call back from the ""manager"". I’ve must have left her 3-5 messages (also ask for call back from corporate, which never happened either) for a call back and today she finally called because I used VERY foul language when I left her this last message. I can admit that because this has been ongoing for almost 2 months and this manager never felt the need to call me once. In today’s conversation she inform me again that the label is at the kiosk and I needed to pick it up. I have told them many times that this is a very busy time of the year for me with work and home life and I can’t make it there. For some reason they said the email will not go through so I give them another email to send it to and asked that they call after they send the email so I can check to see if I got it......NO CALL. So today she finally called to yell at me about my language and to threaten me that she was going to use social media to bad mouth me because I was going to leave a bad review for her POOR customer service. I asked her ONE question that her either could not or would not answer. I asked, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, WAS THERE NO OTHER WAY FOR HER TO EMAIL, FAX, TEXT ETC…. ME THIS LABEL?? Her answer was, “the label is here at the kiosk waiting for you to pick it up”. She shared NO CONCERN for a person’s time NOR did she try to find another way to get me this label to HELP me save some time and not have to drive to the store. Again, I ADMIT my language was bad but this was what it took JUST TO GET A CALL BACK from this manager. How professional is that?? In over 1 month.....this is the first time this manager fell the need to call me back. I work at a car dealership and she had the audacity to question me about how I treat my customers!! Threaten me that she will leave a bad review for me pertaining to my job. Let me give you an example of what I do at my job….new years eve a customer came into the dealership to pick up his car from service only to find out that they closed early and was not able to pick up his car. I work in the sales dept so couldn’t really help him with get his car. Again, this was NEW YEARS EVE at around 7pm! So given the circumstance, I offered the customer a ride home since he informed me that he had to take a LYFT to get to the dealership. If this manager shared the same concern for others as I do, I’m sure this would NOT be happening right nowAs of today, Feb, 2 2020, I have NOT been refunded the taxes I paid in the first order. Label is still sitting at the kiosk waiting for me to pick up and I can’t tell you if I will be getting those gift cards or not. Obviously, all these things would require a bit of customer service support to achieve which I’m not getting. I’m sure not everyone goes through this as I did and most people have a great experience!!!!! So I guess my ONLY question is………Why is this “MANAGER” NOT willing to help resolve a customer service issue??",0,1

At this point, they lost the jewelry credit memo. I asked to check cameras from that day. Costco staff doesn't want to do it, asked for my phone number (again!) and said they'd call me (again!). So today, I have no item (returned), no money. The way the customer service spoke, they appeared eager to get rid of an anxious customer, but - Costco - don't sell jewelry if you can't handle returns! I would recommend to buy jewelry from a retailer as they care about reputation more. Once upon a time, Costco jewelry was cheaper, at least, but not any longer.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Very bad service from Costco,"I joined Costco last July 2019, in September 2019 after buying a new home we signed up with Direct TV and internet from a representative at the Costco store. We were told we would get 450.00 in cards. We received a $50 visa and a $150 visa card and was told we would get a $300 Costco card. So after waiting 3 months we went into the store and spoke with Marcos (who is the direct TV manager at Costco) he said to email Costcovipsupport@directtv I did with no response. Marcos said he emailed them to escalate it as well and no response. So a few weeks later (today) I called Marcos he said call the 888-408-1134 for Costco support and so I did. The first person I spoke with transferred me to another man without telling me he was doing this. I told the next man that was unexceptionable and he said he was going to help me but instead sent me to an automated system without telling me he was going to do this. I hung up and called Marcos back he said he would see what he could do, I stated im coming down there to settle this and he said it wont do me any good he will try to handle it. I called Costco in Clovis California and spoke with Elaina she said she was a manager and she put me on hold and spoke with Marcos and got back on the phone and said we need to answer the phone when an 800 number calls us back. So I called my boyfriend at work and told him if they called him that Costco said we needed to answer the call, they never said which number they are calling. I""m on here giving this review because I feel Costco has lied to us, Direct TV has lied and now they are just pushing us around and telling us we need to answer the phone. We will answer if they call, they have never called nor left any messages. I feel Costco should have made this right. They have not and to be honest I don""t care about the Costco card any longer, I wont be put through so much stress over a $300 gift card.

My order and experience afterward of trying to get answers/resolve mixups with their support team have been SO BAD that it's comical.When I called to verify delivery in time for Christmas I figured that I was just dealing with temporary staff hired to manage the holiday rush..so I didn't mind. NOPE. Everyone I've talked to is clueless about how to handle super common eCommerce support issues.It's like they're hearing the type of issue I'm calling about for the very first time. ""You guys sent the wrong item, can they just bring it into a retail store and exchange for the correct one?""...ummmm, are you sure? The package says delivered. They've been nice for the most part but just SO confused on how to do a return, or how to lookup an incorrect tracking number. Someone needs to re-train their staff, cause it has been like 4+ people who are clueless about BASIC RETURNS & QUESTIONS......On to the orders,I've never ordered from Costco.com but my retail experience has always been incredible so I didn't think twice about entrusting them with getting my Christmas gifts delivered on time.I was SO wrong.I placed a TON of different orders (40+ items) on their site in a short period of time so I get how things can get mixed up but....I do this all the time with Amazon and rarely have issues.First of all, Costco canceled a few orders (without explanation) and never issued refunds. The email wouldn't say ""we're out of stock"" or ""the item won't be delivered in time for the holidays""...just a ""sorry we can't complete your order, you haven't been charged for these items""But actually, I was charged. For all 3 of the mysteriously canceled orders. Costco has always been great so I called to verify 2 days later and they said the delay was probably due to the holiday rush and banks being closed on Christmas. Okay, that makes sense, no problem waiting. I call in a week later after not receiving the refund..."" are you sure? we actually canceled your order, so you didn't get charged."" I didn't feel like explaining to more confused people, so just figured I would wait. No biggie, Costco is awesome. I called again 1st week of January after still not receiving it, ""you should maybe call the bank because we actually didn't charge you."" ""I've never heard of anyone else having this problem""...I'm always nice and calm on support calls (I swear) and really all I could do was laugh. A retail/eCommerce giant has NEVER had anyone call in with a refund issue?? Hahaha...okay, I'll just wait it out, thanks for trying."" Click!**1 nice rep ""got this handled"" for me as of yesterday, he says there is a long-form you have to fill out by hand so maybe that's why no one helped before.**Now to delivery...HUGE SHIPPING DELAYS!Obviously most of my orders were Christmas gifts... and even though I ordered before December 20th, I decided to only purchase items that said ""2-3 day shipping"" just to play it safe.10 items didn't even ship until December 29th!! (Most arrived December 27th or 8th) but some didn't get delivered until after January 3rd, 2020.......A handful of items never even made it.

Holiday rush, I get it.When I call in they have NO IDEA how to look up the package (click the tracking link) and then after I explain it they say ""I think they may have gotten delivered,"" ""are you sure it didn't arrive and they misplaced it""... or ""they're probably on the way"", and then an awkward silence. Really?? haha..it's like they are literally just guessing what to say in response, how is there not a protocol in place for the basic conversation steps of tracing an order?...This has been a nightmare, but honestly, I love Costco so and this might be the only bad experience I've EVER HAD with the brand so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Despite though the late gifts, wrong items, missing refunds and 3 weeks of literally NO ANSWERS...I'm somehow still confident that Costco will fix this, but maybe I'm a fool and should have just gone to Amazon instead of trying to snag some good discounts.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,My family enjoys shopping at Costco,"My family enjoys shopping at Costco. Customer service is 100 times better than what you would expect from QFC or Fred Meyer.

Costco Wholesale,Wish I could give less than one star…,"Wish I could give less than one star for this fraudulent activity.I have been shopping for a dishwasher and found one on Costco online. I went to check out and at check out saw the 2% back when I apply for the Costco card (Citi). Nowhere does it say or explain that it can’t be used for the purchase you are making.I have worked very hard for the last 2 years to max out my credit score. This is why I hadn’t applied for this card sooner, because I didn’t want it to affect my score. I got an immediate alert from my credit screening site that my score dropped 3 points. So, my score dropped 3 points and I can’t use the card for the purchase where it was advertised.I called Citi customer service who sent me to Costco customer service. Customer service stated I would have to wait to get the card in the mail. The item I am trying to purchase says limited quantities and while supplies last. Again the reason I applied for the card in the first place was the 2% back. I tried to chat with customer service and waited 15 minutes for an agent who disconnected when I said there was a problem. I tried again and waited 10 minutes before being connected with “Kiearra F.” As soon as I mentioned there was a problem, they disconnected (I have screen shots). This is a complete slap in the face! Called customer service and they literally don't give a sh!@.So, in summery, I tried to buy a dishwasher, applied for Costco card that said I would get 2% back, negatively effected my credit score by 3 points, got insulted by Costco customer service and still can’t order this dishwasher.",0,1

After shopping in the Costco we found prices to be very high compared to our Sam's Club Membership.Also the pushy sales person TALKED BAD ABOUT SAM'S CLUB.I called to cancel my membership and that was very painful also. Long hold times and the Rep, Cassy M. said she couldn't refund MY MONEY TO MY DEBIT CARD, because I made my wife the primary user and they had to talk to her to refund MY MONEY.Never again will I ever enter a Costco even if they were the last place on earth to do business.

It would be so helpful to be able to pick my items in a digital cart and have it ready for pick up at the store like target.com offers but they have yet to make that a feature. Sometimes I need to go to Costco for one or two items vs the big shopping haul I do once every month and if I could simply pick those items off the site, prepay and pick up at the door it would save me so much time! Maybe that idea cuts against Costco's objective of getting customers to wander around the warehouse but who has time for that every single time!",0,2

Rather than having me stand to the side and try to fix the issue. They embarrassed me intentionally because of who I am. Sorries don't fix it and apologies don't either.

Costco Wholesale,Review of Costco Online Order Experience,"September 17, 2019 I ordered an OXO Cereal Keeper online for $24.99. I received the item packaged in it's OXO box (no other box or packaging material to protect it) on September 20, 2017. One of the cereal keepers was broken. I called customer service. The rep told me he would send me another one at no charge and said not to worry about sending the original package back. I received the next one September 25, 2019. Again, this one was shipped in it's OXO box but the items weren't broken. On December 27, 2019 I received an email from Costco stating they have not received the original package and if I don't send it back I will be charged for it. I called their customer service and told them what the other rep said to me. This representative told me that I would need to send the item back. I explained to her that it was broken and he told me not to send it back so I threw it away. I would have gladly sent them their poorly package broken item back if that was the request when I first made the complaint. She put me on hold to review account notes. When she came back she said the previous rep should not have told me that. She said I would have to wait for a call from their Resolutions team because she can't help me with the issue. Seriously! She can't resolve an issue over a $25 item. It is not my fault if he should not have told me that the fact is he did. If they wanted it back they should have said so in September. I have no emails or phone calls asking for the item until three months later after the original rep told me not to worry about sending it back. I warn you not to shop with Costco especially online.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,So here is my experience with Costco Online Appliance Purchase,"So here is my experience with Costco Online with Appliances, worst ever!!!! I purchased a refrigerator from Costco Online on 12/3/2019, delivery was scheduled and confirmed by both Whirlpool and JB Hunt for 12/20/2019 with a delivery window of 2pm-6pm. The day comes and no call, no show, NOTHING!! mind you, I just moved into a new place and have no refrigerator at all! I call and spoke to a supervisor from JB Hunt (Chris) and all he had to say is that there was no reason why your appliance could not be delivered. I then had to call Whirlpool back again to reschedule and the earliest that they can re-deliver was today 12/27/2019, a week later than the original delivery date that they promised. Delivery for today had a window of 8am-12pm. 10:30am comes and I'm starting to worry as I have not received any calls, so I call Whirlpool which took about 30 minutes on Hold to get an actual person. Come to find out JB Hunt the delivery company canceled my delivery without any warning. By this time I'm done, I've had no refrigerator for the holidays and for a little over a week now. I called Costco to cancel, speak to escalation department which I'm still waiting on a call back. I went to Lowes and had to drop $324 more on a refrigerator that should be delivered Saturday 12/28/2019. I love Costco Wholesale but the manufacturer and the delivery company dropped the ball pretty bad and no one wants to take blame or make it right.Please Do not buy any large items as their 3rd party companies that they use to process orders and delivery are the worst.Previously I have seen multiple people post about their bad experience that they also had from Costco Online (Large items) but I thought this would not happen to me (crossing fingers). The sad part is that all 3 companies are pointing fingers at each other and not taking responsibility for the headache, trouble and time I've gone through with all these companies on the phone.

A tracking number from UPS was issued and for 5 days the status stayed the same, ""label printed."" Finally after repeated phone calls Costco determined that it had been lost and that I could wait another 5 days for a new one to ship out (no offer of express shipping) or wait another 5 days for my funds to be refunded. I chose refund and am purchasing somewhere else. TERRIBLE customer service, not the people, but the system.

I love that!I haven't had a single negative experience at Costco that was at the fault of the Employees or company.

Costco Wholesale,Bad Experience all Around,I went online thanksgiving day to purchase a 70” television from Costco. After spending hours on their broken website I finally got my order submitted. The website stated that delivery would be 7 to 10 days. After 12 days I chatted with their customer service online. They indicated they could not give me an update on delivery. Finally after more than 20 days I was supposed to receive my television. I scheduled a delivery with a time frame of 12 noon to 4 PM. I took the day off from work and used a vacation day. At 4:30pm I called the shipping company only to find out they never put the television on the truck and never informed me. They were very casual in their response and did not seem to care. Now they want me to cancel my plans and spend my Saturday waiting home. This is frustrating because I received seven email messages indicating that my delivery would be coming and to be sure I was home to receive it.

We get it finally delivered and we ask why they are not installing it - they simply said, well, we just deliver it. We will have someone come on Sunday to install it. It's Sunday, and here come the installers (which by the way, we never got a message as to what window of time we should expect them. so we had to call ourselves to make sure)....they look around for the installation kit, and lo and behold, the delivery people did not leave it with us. So, now we have to wait AGAIN for another day for someone to come back out WITH an installation kit to finally install. Whatever 3rd company works with Costco does not know what the ""right hand or left hand"" is doing! No sense of communication. How can you run a business like this???COSTCO - you need to find a better company to outsource your delivery and installation services.

Costco Wholesale,Worst I mean the worst online web site…,"Worst I mean the worst online web site and customer care that I have ever dealt with. I gave it a one star in which it should be a zero. Let me explain why, this is totally unbelievable. Of course we go online Thanksgiving night to order earpods, after 4 hours we finally got them ordered. Now here comes the story , instead of shipping them together since they were placed on the same order they shipped them separately, we received the conformation that they shipped and recieved package 2 of the shipment the other package showed that it was going to be delayed but is out for delivery. We waited then we received another noticed stating that it will arrive the next day. Well we waited and then we received another noticed that it was cancelled and returned to Costco. We called Costco in which someone from their office had got on and requested it to be returned. But they could not confirm whom. We called UPS and they confirmed that there was an order to return the product to Costco. The Costco rep told my wife to go online and reorder, in which she tried but sold out plus the black friday deal was over. The she received an email from Costco the day after stating that UPS was unable to deliver due to in correct address. Please remember we had already received package 1 of the 2 package deal that was ordered together on the same single invoice. We called them again this morning hoping for a resolution but was told that there is nothing that they can do. SORRY. so I have two grand daughters both wanted these items for christmas, now I'm to tell them SORRY Costco on line is the worst in the world. Love the store but the CEO for their web site needs to be fired.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Horrible experience with buying electronics online.,"Horrible experience with buying some electronics. No button to cancel the order 5 min after placing it! They just ship it no matter what. I placed 2 orders on Sunday evening, called them at Monday morning to cancel one of them and change the address on the other. Useless, it's already in UPS hands. Costco told me to call UPS. Called UPS, the order is not theirs yet. Waisted 40 min on the phone. Evening - 3 order status updates at the same time. The order is shipped!The worst part is that I recently moved and changed the address only in the account information. How was I supposed to know that they have an address book that has barely anything to do with the address in the account information? I agree that it's my fault that I pressed the Order button without noticing the old address there, it's very easy on their ugly website. But why can't I change anything 5 minutes after placing the order???Botton line: 2 orders, one of them I don't need are shipped to 60km from where I currently live. I caught an error very early but with Costco, you can't do anything in this case.Never, ever again I will buy from Costco online again. The whole experience like it's 1995.

Costco Wholesale,Horrible Customer Service,"I don’t normally write reviews. However, today’s experience at my local Van Nuys Costco, deserves a “0” rating. Mind you, I have been going to this Costco for about 11 years now. My 9 year old son and I were patiently waiting for a demo to try dumplings, when we were verbally accosted by another patron/shopper basically over who was in line first. I didn’t even try any dumplings, but my 9 year old took a piece of the dumpling first before that 50-60 year old man. This apparently caused the man great emotional distress that he couldn’t try the food before my child. He started screaming at me, reprimanding me on my parenting skills, and calling me names. I then saw the crazed man in check-out line and demanded Costco’s intervention and to speak with the supervisor. The supervisor on duty didn’t do anything. He just kept saying, “let’s keep the line moving.” I finished law school and I am a legal professional. I understand legally what Costco could have done and could not do and its repercussions. However, I believe that, at the very least, a Costco representative could have intervened and talked to the man as he continued to insult me when he left. The supervisor and the store manager just directed me to call the police, which I did. I am not sure for what reason because surely police didn’t come out for a verbal assault altercation and after the man had already left, and despite the fact that Van Nuys station is just a couple of minutes away. Of course, police only gets involved when someone is already bleeding out. After the incident, I spoke to three different supervisors, including the head store manager. Although they agreed with me that the situation could have been handled differently, Costco lost me as a loyal customer. After shootings in El Paso’s Walmart, I feel that even if you go shopping you are not safe. I am seriously thinking of canceling Costco membership and getting Amazon Prime. Less headache for a working individual.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Membership Not Worth It,I bought a Costco membership a few months ago. My first purchase was a car battery but I found out they don't install so that went back after I tried and failed to put it in myself. I bought one at Walmart instead and they installed it. Black Friday preview I saw a desk I wanted. I was anxious to purchase 2 of them on Thanksgiving. I tried all day and only got the message that the site was too busy. I tried at midnight. Finally got through. A message said they would extend the sale because of the technical problems. But the desk shows the original price which is double the sale price. And it is back ordered for a month. Costco membership is not worth the trouble. The only good thing about it is the gas prices but I don't live close enough to benefit from that very often. I will never buy another Costco membership.,0,1

I am so frustrated with the level of contempt present Costco.com has for the customer to not have something in place to fix these issues.

Alas, the driver calls 2 minutes before the latest time of delivery to let me know he is an hour behind. Well that's fine, however, no one bothered to inform me that it wasn't going to be delivered yesterday, the original time it was scheduled to be delivered.

They sent all of the items back right away, so that we had to go all over the store to get them again. A customer in line felt so bad for the way this rude cashier and supervisor treated us that they offered to buy our merchandise for us. Fortunately for us, after looking for customer service, we ran into the manager Chance B. He was wonderful and cashed us out in less than three minutes. He told us that there was no excuse for their poor behavior, and that they were wrong for denying us as we had proper identification to make the purchase.

Then when you call Costco to get an update on the supposed earliest date (because costco fails to provide tracking details via email) you then have to call UPS only to find out it's barely being shipped and will take 3 additional business days to arrive! Costco shipping sucks! Like many old retail chains they will phase out too and end up dead in the water when you consider the convenience, cost effectiveness and quick shipping Amazon offers! Now I'm 5 days out of a laptop when I would of already had it in my hands via Amazon! I should charge thier butt an inconvenience fee! Do yourself a favor and either ask what location carries it in stock or simply buy it via AMAZON!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Bought four bridgestone tires at…,Bought four bridgestone tires at frederickburg va warehouse. I went on highway two weeks later and car started making noises which I couldn't detect what it was and it got louder and louder. I came to red light heard loud clunk. Started to pull over my tire fell off. The lugs nuts broke off and tire went across 4 lanes of highway. Some how it didn't hit a car. I called tow truck first and then called costco. They were sorry and said they would take care of it. Went there the next day and said they would fix my car. They paid for part of the tow which my insurance didn't cover. Well that lasted until someone from corporate put the brakes on and said they had to investigate. So that was the last nice thing that happened. Its been two weeks going on three and car is still not fix. They got more papers to do their investigation. Now they are trying to blame someone else. The guy that is doing the investigation needs a expert. So I'm going to fix it myself. So much for customer service. This could of Been a bad accident but that doesn't matter. Somebody needs to talk to corporate. I've been a customer for 30 years. thought they were better than that. All I can say is if you buy any tires checks your lug nuts. We could of been killed as we just left the highway.,0,1

Costco Wholesale,They don't stand behind their products for warranty,"Our families are Costco loyal customer for twenty some years until lately couple warranty incidents - tires and glasses. I bought a set of 4 Bridgestone tires from Costco in Dec 2017, They had 70,000 miles warranty, but one tire was leaking air in Aug 2019. Took it in for repair, the tire department told me the treads got below 2/32 cannot be repaired, need a new set of tires. I had 46,000 miles on the tires. I then asked for pro-rated warranty, the clerk figured out I could get $35 back for each tire, but need the manager to approve. Next day, the clerk left me a voice message said the manager declined the pro-rate warranty, because I missed couple times tire rotation, each should be 8000 miles. I have been told the tire manager was on holiday till Thursday I then waited 4 days, called back try to talk to him, they said he just left for holiday till next week. At that point, doesn't matter how I explain the situation, they won't listen. I asked to talk to the Costco manager, he is a nice guy, try to understand the situation and help, but at the end he said they need to look after the business to make money, cannot honor the warranty based on the records that I missed couple tire rotation. Here is the fact, the tire had 70,000 miles warranty, they used 46,000 miles less than two years, and all 4 tires had the same wear down thickness 2/32 left on the rubber when they measured. I took it in rotated the tires around 16,000 miles in between on their records. However, I rotated outside the Costco right around 8000 miles during the regular oil change and took it back on alternate period. The fact is Costco is a very busy place, I told the manager, that I try to do something good for them, instead of waiting for 20 minutes every time visit the tire center. If they want, everyone of us could go back rotate the tires at around 8000 miles, look at the business, they have to hire a few more workers just to do this. The Costco manager is very professional, let me explain the situation and we have a good talk for 20 minutes. Despite the fact, the manger says ""I am sorry, I got my hand tie, cannot honor the warranty, the Bridgestone deal is not the best, we have a better deal on sale after the labor day, You can come back buy 4 new Michelin tires........"" He is right, this is all about business. I found that I just waste 1/2 hour of my valuable time two times, and no car to drive for a few days. I found alternate transportation though, but just inconvenience and felt the promise and trust got burst. $35 pro-rate is not a big deal, but I just woke up. I even told Mr. Manager that I am so disappointed, they just want to make money, ignored the customers, you know the customers are the one who will make them bigger and stronger. They don’t honor the warranty, not even offer split the difference as I was willing to take the deal of the half warranty. Costco turn away a lot of loyal customers when I check the reviews. I can bring the business to someone else who value their customers.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,I have been a Costco member for the…,"I have been a Costco member for the past 20 years. I spend about $ 5000 - 7000 every year with Costco. In addition, we also used to buy all our vacation packages from Costco Travel and spend about 3000 $ to 14000 $ per vacation. But the way Costco just abandoned us and left us at the mercy of small cheesy delivery companies was just shocking. Did not expect this from Costco. We saw a nice looking book shelf in Costco for $ 400. But Costco store said they won't deliver it home. So, I bought the 2 book shelves from Costco online and paid extra $ 150 per book shelf for home delivery. Costco online website clearly said they will deliver it inside the house and not in the garage or block any front entrance or inside doorways. Each book shelf weighed about 300 pounds and the box measured about 4x6.5x2 feet deep. So, I paid extra $ 300 thinking it would be delivered inside my house and placed the order with Costco Online.Surprise, surprise, 3 weeks later a truck shows up in my driveway with one driver/mover. The guy says I am going to put in your garage. I told him I paid extra $ 300 for inside home delivery but the guy would have none of it and flat out said and I quote "" I don't work for Costco"". You paid Costco, I deliver in your garage. After much arguing, finally the driver agreed to move it to my study which was immediately after my garage provided I help him to move. My first instinct was to turn him back and say F-off. But, I had waited for the shelves for 3 weeks and took time off from work to receive them. So, I reluctantly agreed to help him unload and then put it on a buggy and move it inside my house. While helping to stand up the shelf in my study, I was lifting the box only with my left hand as I was in a corner and in the process tore my left arm bicep. I knew right away once I heard a snapping noise and the pain shot through my left arm. I yelled and told the mover I had injured my left arm and ran to my refrigerator to ice it hoping it was just a sprain. By then 1 book shelf was in place and now the mover calls me out to move the 2nd book shelf. I told him my left arm was already injured and the chap goes "" well use your right Arm"". So again I reluctantly stepped out helped him load the 2nd shelf on the buggy and moved it to our study barely helping with my right hand. we got the 2nd shelf in place finally. By then it was close to 6 PM and decided to head to ER to see how bad was my injury on my left arm. Reston, VA ER X-ray showed no broken bones. But the ER doc looked at my left arm and the internal bleeding and swelling and said it maybe a bicep tear and asked me get it checked with a Orthopedic doctor. 4 days later Orthopedic and MRI confirmed it was a left arm bicep tear due to furniture move incident. I had to go through surgery, take 2 week off work and 4 months of physio therapy and still has not healed. I narrated the whole incident to Costco customer service or legal and they recorded my statement and conveniently said we did not deliver the furniture. issue happened during CEVA logistics delivery company's work. So they convinced me to file a claim with this cheesy delivery company 'CEVA logistics"" and told me they would follow up. Basically, Costco washed their hands-off at that point even though I bought the furniture from website and nowhere did they say there will be a delivery company and we are not responsible. Moreover, Costco website will promise delivery inside the house but delivery company came and said nothing doing we deliver outside, deal with it !!!. Costco basically sells the furniture with all kinds of promises charges extra for home delivery and quietly retreats from the scene. I narrated the whole incident again to this delivery company, they recorded my statement and promised an investigation. After 6 months, got back me to with a investigation result that stated1. they were not negligent, they were not supposed to move the furniture inside the house, 2.I volunteered to help the mover and got injured in the process !!!., 3. also implied I already had an earlier injury that I was reporting. Even though I had told them I had no previous arm injuries. 4. And much cheesy investigation results that are not worth reporting here..Costco was copied on this investigation response from the delivery company but does not want to get involved and do the right thing. It has been 6 months since left arm bicep tear happened during Costco furniture delivery, I went through left arm surgery, physio therapy and my left arm has still not recovered fully. Now it turns out, this will have long term implications on my left arm strength. I am talking to lawyers, doctors to understand what this means and looks like a long drawn out legal fight. So be it. Buyer beware, just because you are buying from Costco does not mean they will take responsibility. Costco will wash their hands off and abandon you at the earliest opportunity whether you are right or completely truthful simply does not matter. RegardsPradeep SomayajiOld Costco member.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Membership team misinformed about credit application process,"I applied for a new Executive membership, and the membership team told me about the Costco Citi card offer going on right now. I told them I have relatively poor credit and have been rebuilding my scores for the past 2 years, that I likely would not qualify for the card, and that I especially did not want to put an unnecessary hard inquiry on my credit report for a card I'm not qualified for.The manager told me that people with a wide range of scores get approved for the card and that it was only a pre-approval check, which would only be a soft inquiry on my credit report. I was assured there would be no downside just to check, even with my mediocre credit scores.So I said ""ok, why not?"" and filled out the application. A minute later I got a notification from Credit Karma that a hard inquiry had been initiated on my credit report, and I was denied the credit card (as I expected).I know a credit inquiries are a small part of the overall credit report. But for someone who has been working diligently to rebuild credit over the recent years, this whole process felt like a real slap in the face.What makes me angriest is that I repeatedly insisted I didn't want to risk a hard pull on my credit, and was repeatedly told that there was no hard pull and that applying was a pre-approval process that was 100% safe. I thought the membership team knew something I didn't about how their credit application process worked, but it turns out they knew less than I did.So Costco as a whole is great, I just wish their own membership employees had a better understanding of how these things worked before pressuring customers into applying for a credit card just so they can meet their internal quotas.Absolutely frustrating experience, and not what I expected from Costco.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,I do not know where to start,"I do not know where to start, we have had so many issues with the purchase of a Samsung French door Refrigerator. The refrigerator arrived very late in the evening a couple of weeks after ordering. Delivery service was polite and quick to work, the removed our front door in order to get refrigerator into our house. Once in they moved old refrigerator to garage, inserted new refrigerator into its place. As they pushed refrigerator into place they left a five inch scratch across my kitchen floor and a hole in my wood floor! They acted as that was no big deal, not their problem.Tired of having these people in our house we just let them leave. Happy to at least have new refrigerator, waited awhile to let it cool. Went in after a couple of hours and started to put food into it. We went to bed thinking all was well, wrong. Next morning milk was not cold! It was to warm. The refrigerator was 62 degrees!!!!! Everything was ruined !!!!!!!! Called Costco was told to give them 48 hours to find a service tech. We waited Samsung called us to tell us that there are no service techs in our area. They can not fix our refrigerator, please call Costco warranty service for refund. Called Costco they were very helpful, but wish English was their first language not second. Told Costco would refund money and arrange for pick up of refrigerator. I was to wait 5-7 business days for someone to call me. I waited 8 business days and had to call Costco back!! The gentleman said I should be getting a call from someone that day and I did, finally ! Arrangements made for a week later for pick up!On the day they were to pick up refrigerator I received an odd call from Miami, someone speaking Spanish and did not seem to hear me. I hung up, thinking it was a solicitor. Ten minutes later I get a call from that number again, this time was told by a man with a heavy Spanish accent not to hang up! He was going to be at my house in ten minutes. Okay?The pick up people arrive, neither spoke English well but we kept going. I explained 3 times to remove front door because refrigerator is to big if they don’t. Okay okay they said. They took handles off refrigerator, measured it and strapped it on to move it. They did not remove front door as I had repeatedly told them to. They wedged the refrigerator into the front door opening!!! Oh no they realize they have to remove the front door!!!! They proceed to back up and remove door. Then they strap on refrigerator on again and take it out. They did come back and put my front door back on. Once they finished with my front door they leave, I went to check door to find that they scratched my door frame. Now I have to repaint!!! Never will I buy anything that requires delivery from Costco!!!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,I think Costco Online is a mess!,"I think Costco Online is a mess! There are so many problems on the ordering side. Some food items are now listed as not being available in my zip code, but an item that would be right next to it in the store is available. The zip code they have listed is not my zip code, so I change it and save the changes. When I come back to the site and login, the wrong zip code is once again shown. Amazon works, but Costco Online doesn't! The ""Non-Member Surcharge"" they are now using is applied to the subtotal amount, and not the amount after the sales price deductions have been taken off. This happens on all orders, and seems very dishonest if not criminal. I know this isn't a sales tax, but can you imagine going to the grocery store, and having to pay sales tax against the cost of items before any sales reductions are applied? There are so many software problems in their system!!! I spent 44 minutes on the phone yesterday with a very nice customer service representative, where I explained a lot of the problems, but Costco doesn't have a way for this information to get back to Corporate, so it was just a waste of my time and hers! They have a Feedback link which is truly a joke. The emails I receive when I make a purchase have many errors, which I pointed out to the support person when speaking to her on the phone.I have been a Costco shopper since 1990. The problem is you have to be near a store and buy enough to make the cost of the membership fee worthwhile. I now live 30 miles from a store so only use online, as I am old and retired and don't want to drive 60 miles and pay a membership fee. If the management at Costco would WAKE UP and join the current world with a well designed and customer focused online service, I think they would do well. Look at Amazon!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Good job Innovel,"We had an excellent experience from a washer dryer purchase at Costco thanks to an Innovel technition named Reggie NeSmith. Our washer and dryer were delivered when they indicated but the dryer door needed to open from the other direction. On this particular LG dryer, this was no easy task. We were concerned as to how long it would take to get this done and it was a Friday afternoon. About 15 minutes later, we got a call from Reggie at Innovel that he was coming to reverse the door. He arrived around 6 pm, dismantled the door, reversed it, and the whole time with a smile. This particular door required a lot of work and the Costco call center said it would have to be taken back to the distribution center for the work to be done. Reggie did it in our home that same day. Lot of compliments to Reggie on his work and to Innovel for employing him. He is a talent. Thank you Innovel for getting him to our home that evening.",0,5
Costco Wholesale,"Samsung Washer Dryer from Costco a good buy, best price with cash back and Samsung has good customer service","15 March 2020:I'm upgrading my Trust in Costco Appliances from ""Never buy appliances from Costco with one star"" to 4 stars based on my experience with the product in last 6+ months.I had not so great experience initially for the reasons I mentioned earlier. However, after reflecting upon my experience with the use of these appliances, great customer service from Samsung, and realizing that Costco and their partner could have done some customer education upfront, my experience would have been far better.I had a question my washer, I called Samsung customer service, they were very helpful in addressing my information needs regarding the operation of the washer. After all, Costco did offer me the best price for the quality products. Both Washer and Dryer perform efficiently, quiet and reliable. The extension cord powering the pilot light of the gas powered dryer is not ideal. It would have been great if they provided the information that Costco support provided me about power adapter compatibility on the product page itself when I made the purchase. Even better provide me an option to buy the adapter right there with the original purchase.Posted on 07 July 2019:I'm posting my bad experience with Costco Appliances here because Costco won't let me submit a review when I had bad delivery and installation experience.Costco is not the place to buy appliances. I learned it the hard way. I purchased Samsung Washer Dryer combo on 20 June 2019. It's been a month I'm unable to use it without any solution. When I selected washer and dryer, it didn't guide me that I need to first figure out power plug compatibility.Innovel Solutions is their delivery company. these guys showed up at my house and still didn't a compatibility check with the power plug. Unloaded WD, and found out at the end that my wall had 4 prong socket and the gas dryer had 3 prong plug. They just left it running on an extension cord. Using extension cord is a fire hazard and a child can trip over it and get injured. When I called Innovel, they said nothing can be done.I contacted Costco online Chat multiple times, only they can talk to the Costco appliance line. First time I called, they asked me to setup appointment with Innovel which I did, Innovel didn't show up on the assigned day. When I called about when they will be coming, their agent said they have no record of anyone scheduled to come for the day. I had taken a day off from work.I escalated second time, Costco setup appointment with Innovel. I asked Innovel what time on Monday they will show up, they told me that I'll get a phone call on Sunday evening on the schedule which I didn't receive. I called on Monday at 6 am, they told me that they will show up between 1 and 4 pm. I didn't want to lose another day at work because I wasn't sure they will even show up given last time they didn't keep their appointment. I rescheduled it to today, 20 July 2019. Again I didn't get a call yesterday what time they will show up. I just called them now and they gave me a different story that dryer cable can't be replaced while Costco said it can be and will be.Innovel's support agents have no passion for customer service, no customer empathy, no desire for problem solving, they are there just to give customers a run around.I bought Refrigerator from Home Depot and had a pleasant experience with their delivery and installation. When I asked them why can't you match Costco price on WD, they warned me about the service. They were right. I saved a couple of hundreds and got lured by longer warranty period but it cost me 500+ (time off from work) and still Dryer isn't usable. Warranty is useless when they can't service, so it doesn't matter whether it's 1 yr, 3 yr to 5 yr warranty. I'll be returning these and buying from HD.",0,4

Costco Wholesale,Shipping Policy: Discrimination against people who work out of home,"Hi,Recently, our family had a very bad experience with regard to COSTCO shipping policy for online purchases. I feel it as an example of discrimination against people who work out of home. My brother purchased Portable Air Conditioner at COSTCO online, making this purchase from local San Jose COSTCO store.1) COSTCO did not provide possibility to pick up the item from a local store.2) To avoid waiting at home, we expected to use My Choice Premier membership I have with UPS. This membership normally allows to pick up the packages from UPS Access Point nearby my home as well as to schedule 2-hour window to get the shipment at home. So my brother sent the package to me. 3) However, during the shipping, it appeared that COSTCO policy restrictions did not allow use of UPS Access Point pick up as well as 2-hour time frame. On the other side, I could not accept package’s delivery at home during the day because I work out of home. I used “Change Delivery” option provided by UPS and directed the shipment to my brother’s address. His wife was sitting and waiting a whole day home for item “Out for delivery”.4) However, at evening, I got online notification in my UPS profile that “Receiver name is incorrect”, and UPS auto system told that “item is undeliverable”. The reason of this was COSTCO’s restriction for delivery address change. COSTCO shipping policy allowed only 3 UPS attempts to my address during the day, while UPS required the signature of receiver because of item’s cost. If delivery did not happen, item should have gone back to COSTCO.5) Yesterday, my brother’s wife was sitting all the day in my house to receive the package, and UPS brought the package at 7:30pmMoreover, during all this shipping tale, I made about 15 calls to UPS and 3-4 calls to COSTCO for verification purposes.I feel more than upset with this purchasing experience. I do a lot of online shopping, and I have never encountered so much inflexible vendor. As a result of restrictions, COSTCO shipping policy prevents working people from making purchases online. To conclude, I feel like only customers who have in their family retired, unemployed, sick members, or members on maternity leave may allow themselves making COSTCO online purchases.I learned from this experience NOT to make any online purchase from COSTCO until I retire.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,disappointed......,disappointed......I love Costco and try to buy and use costco services. I have purchase a car through the costco program. I have purchased travel and now 2 HVAC systems. Normally I am Costco happy. this time when purchasing my 2nd HVAC system I think I got ripped off the last HVAC system I purchased was 6500.00 in 2014 and installed by Cool Air Mechanical - great job and great purchase. This time I paid 8995.00 for the same size unit - it was installed correctly but I can't believe the unit have increase that much. Cool Air Mechanical gave me pricing but they blamed costco for the price increase. Both time Costco had the Cash back incentive and since I had such a good experience I did this with out much thought. Once I looked at my old paper work I felt like I got taken advantage of . My recommendations are don't assume your getting a great deal with Costco shop around. disappointed,0,3

Costco Wholesale,Disrespect,"Today, I was in Costco and attempted to do something I've done for years which is use my mother's membership card. The cashier notices the differences in names and says he will have to wait for the manager to override. The manager refuses to override the transaction. The manager chose to speak to me in a demeaning and disrespectful tone. The manager further demeaned me by taking my mother's membership card and refusing to return it. I told him over and over again, that I did not give him permission to take the card from me. The situation could have been handled differently- the manger could have stated the rules and then tried to sale me a membership. Memberships are only $60 but instead this front end manager chose to demean me. Membership agreement did not give him authority to take the card. The agreement says the card must be returned upon request and he did not Request the card. The manager could have handled the situation in a respectful manner and instead he chose to be disrespectful. Costco needs to denounce this manager's behavior.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Almost everything a brick-and-mortar store should be,"As a dedicated Costco customer (two to three times a month) here is my take:Pros:-Prices are from fair to incredible.-Quality standards are maintained so you can usually trust a Costco purchase.-Staff is consistently helpful and friendly.-Return policy is the best. Despite the fact that so many people take unfair advantage of it.Cons:-Limited selection.-Uncertainty in availability. One never knows, even with Kirkland branded items, if a certain product will be available again in the future or never again. This is my only major complaint.-Inability to check available inventory on-line for a particular item. Because selection varies from location-to-location it would nice to be able to check if an item, not available at one location, is available at one of the others. This is my major wish item for the Company-Frequent relocation of items within a store. Assumedly so you visit each isle looking for a particular product.",0,5

Costco Wholesale,"Whats not to like, eat before you buy... win,win, win.","Costco is, in all fairness, the only place where I have had it proven that, “try before you buy” works, ….

To have bought them before tasting them would have been too much of a “gamble” for me, living on a budget, as most of us do now. But then I tasted the product, and that won me over, but when you have tried a free sample with no obligation or pushiness to buy the food product, you feel in the driving seat to make an unbiased decision weather or not to buy or deny your purchase.The fuel as well, top notch fuel at decent forecourt prices, and YES, the diesel does indeed last longer than say, Asda or Texaco, where I used to pay more and get less miles… isn’t that win, win, win?Keep up the great work Costco.",0,5

Costco Wholesale,Costco prices on inventory no need to ever pay full price on Big Ticket Item again,"In Mid Jan of this year I purchased a chair from Costco for 225.00 dollars today is Marc 13thThe chair price now is 99.99 dollars YES wow. After calling the Wilsonville store in Oregon and speaking with Ramundo ( supervisor may have mis-spelt thta) it seems that Costco basis is price and then drops it’s price more than half in his case based on Inventoey so I am told. Sorry nothing we can do. so we have a customer loyal at that ever so trusting in our BIG warehouse store, think Hum 225.00 what a good price. Costco is great always dependable in pricing, has the consumer Ian MIND. Not so if they have a large inventory they after 6 weeks slash the price like in this case more than half. So all you hard working people before you go into Costco and buy ANY big ticket Item you. First go to customer serviceAsk. 1. HOW MUCH INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE ON THIS ITEM 2. GET AN EXACT NUMBER 3. IF IT IS A LARGE INVENTORY NUMBER 4. STOP RIGHT THERE DO BUY IT WAIT WAIT WAIT 6 WEEKS 5. I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE IN 6 TO 7 WEEKS The PRICE WILL HAVE DROPED BY MORE THAN 60 to 70 PERCENT 6. ALL YOU HARD WORKING PEOPLE CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEYThis is how Costco operates by inventory, those were Raymundo’s exact words sorry there is nothing we can do, it is Costco Policy, so all you hard working people check first, before you spend the money you worked so hard for. COSTCO is a BIG BOX Giant that cares nothing for it’s consumer. You need never pay full price at Costco again by following these simple steps. Want to save money get exact inventory, ah how the so don’t care Costco is in it for Costco your not getting a deal.Oh Raymundo did tell me I could have brought is back in 30 days really it was slashed to 70 percent not in 30 days but 6 weeks yes it would have worked had it been a mind reader. Not to enrich the fact ai am out of the country and the chair is sitting in my Newberg OR house I do not return until April 16.So shop with your conscious everyone but please know you need never to buy any large ticket item at full price just be patient. I wouldn’t even go into to the supervisors lack of training in customer service, to many words just wanted to make sure you save money not spend it at a big ticket warehouse store that could care less about it’s consumer.

Sam's club has almost exact flooring and they offer the Click and Pull offer. Sam's club employees shop for you and everything is ready for pick-up and you can pay online or at the club. Costco...you will have to step up your game pretty quickly to keep up. Manager called back way after the allotted time and really offered nothing to help.

You walk into the ENTRANCE, but to get to the MEMBERS DESK, you have to go in the EXIT. But wait, you have a MILITANT SECURITY PERSON, who won't let in the Exit. Ok, so you go in the entrance, only to discover, you can't get to the MEMBERS DESK, without making a purchase, AND, you can't make a purchase without a card!!I picked up 4 items, went to the ENTRANCE, and asked the other MILITANT SECURITY GUARD, if I could please go around to the MEMBERS DESK. You would have thought I was asking for the code to the vault. I literally just needed to go from the entrance door to the exit door, to get to the MEMBERS DESK. This woman kept telling me that if she allowed that, she would get fired. REALLY?? By the way, I'm a handicapped person who has to ride an electric scooter. So, then she tells me I have to get a regular cart & leave with her before I can go from ENTRANCE TO EXIT.OK. My husband goes and gets a regular cart, & I'm ALLOWED to go to the MEMBERS DESK. Once I have my Handy Dandy card in hand, I go to pay for my 4 items, only to find out COSTCO doesn't accept any credit card but VISA! I was using my MC.

Costco.com told me the order for the item(s) not canceled, but told me just to wait for JB Hunt to contact me again about delivery.

I remember this incident well because I was actually annoyed by the clerk this time as she mentioned before she even gave me the tickets something to the effect that she has to count them well because I wouldn’t bring them back to the store if she gave me too many (more or less accusing me of stealing tickets before she even gave them to me). I bought 2 sheets of tickets for a totally of 24 tickets. Now they have to investigate to see if she gave me too many or not! How is it that you treat you customers like this.

Costco Wholesale,As a loyal Costco Executive Member…,"As a loyal Costco Executive Member since 2004, it is difficult to believe the online shopping experience we've had over the past 45 days. November 9th - Spirit Delivery Services delivered a new GE Washer and Dryer purchased online November 5th. The dryer containined 2 golf ball sized dents on the top. Additionally, the delivery/installer technician allowed gas to escape into our home as he deinstalled/installed the dryer. He instructed us not to turn on the dryer for 15-20 mins to let the gas odor out of the house. They left without further explanation. This was a dangerous and frighting experience that we are still thankful did not have a different outcome. After the November 9th delivery/installation the dryer would not heat. Costco was contacted and we were offered either a new dryer or service call for November 12th. We opted for the New dryer, given the dents in the first dryer.November 12th - Contacted by Costco that the delivery of the new dryer was delayed until November 19th. November 19th - New Dryer delivered - knob on the new dryer was broken. November 26th - 3rd dryer was delivered at which time delivery/installer indicated the gas valve to the dryer was locked in the off position and the new dryer could not be installed without a plumber making the repair to the gas valve. From November 9th to the present - Costco, GE and Spirit have continued to give us the run around as to who is responsible for the damages to our gas valve and commitments made by their customer service representatives have yet to be honored. Numerous calls to Costco, GE and Spirit have resulted in no ownership of the problem and no actions to resolve our needed repair. Spirit implied the gas valve was probably already damaged. Spirit did send a claim form via their insurance company for the damages, but no one has contacted us about the documentation submitted regarding the incident. We have personally hired and paid a plumber to fix the valve, install the dryer. He diagnosed, repaired, and installed the new valve having the new dryer ready within 45 min.

Costco Wholesale,Bought a HP Envy recently form…HP Laptop freezes so badly - worst customer service experience,"Bought a HP Envy recently form Costco.com. It freezes so frequently, so badly. 10+ times in an hour. Freezes even when no applications are brought up. Worked with Costco concierge and HP for months. Spent so many hours, in trouble shooting along with them on the call, then downloading and installing the softwares they ask us to reinstall. Though it is still within a year warranty, they don't want to take it back/fix it. I think they are trying to drag it to go beyond 1 year, so they can say it is out of warranty. I asked HP person if my particular model known to have issues. She said yes. I asked her, if the new software/image that she gives me, is same as what it came with or it is an upgraded one, that known to have fixed the issue. She said it is the same version as it came with my laptop. For a given firmware, if a baseline of software/image doesn't work, there is no point on keep on reinstalling the same baseline and expect for some miracle to happen. When I call Costco.com after all this, for a warranty/return, they ask me to contact Costco concierge. Concierge says they don't process return. They ask me to call Costco.com. When I call Costco.com, after they read through case notes, they just ask me to call concierge, then goes on in circles. Or some agents say, go to Costco store. I even went there. Costco store says, if you bought it online at Costco.com, you have to call them. I think their tactics is, they try to pass it to different department of theirs. Each one does same in turn. And also they can't access case notes across divisions. For their convenience, it's been setup that way I think. So we have to retell the whole story every time. I have been with Costco for more than 10 years. We are executive member. I haven't even tried to return even a single product all these years. I think IT IS TIME TO WALK OUT OF COSTCO.

After complaining the issue in physical costco store i received a email with proper tracking number..i thought it will be good from here..i received the email the TV will be delivered on a date 2 - 6 pm CST.[It put me through an online appointment scheduler] I picked a date that worked out for me. and i can be out from work during the delivery time and at around 2:30 pm ..the delivery person called ---I will in your area at 8:30 pm ....I told him the appointment window is for 2 - 6 pm ..""here is the response i received..."" i got 35 orders to deliver ..whatever time i told you that is time i can deliver to your place...I'm doing a delivery right now..i got to go..go ahead and reschedule.""..how do i reschedule ..i don't have that information... remember this guy suppose to deliver my 75inch TV. What a shame -- never i will order a product from costco.com. Also - Try writing a negative review on costco.com website, your review get moderated stating - ""shipping and customer experience cannot be added on the review""...please..what a shady practice. Stay away from costco.com",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Don't pay for faster shipping,"I ordered two orders of photo greeting cards, one right after the other. The first one I paid regular shipping on and the second, because I needed it quickly, paid additional money for faster service. Well, both orders arrived together. So much for paying extra. But then I spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to talk to the photo service customer service rep and not only was his English iffy, I do not think he had any idea of why I called or what my complaint was. I will never pay for faster shipping with Costco again. I threw away $5.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,If I could give less than 1 star,"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. We ordered wedding flowers for 10/6 date directly from Costco and were assured they would arrive Fri before the wedding. They didn't so called Fri afternoon and was told Fed Ex fault not theirs--after calls back & forth, it wasn't Fed Ex issue. So hours on phone later and panicked arrangements for different flowers ordered locally the afternoon before the wedding day, they agreed to cancel order and give me refund plus $100 gift card for my trouble. Two full months later and I still don't have gift card. I've talked to 5 Costco employees since including a supervisor who have all promised calls and emails with updated status -- and nothing. Now the supervisor's phone number rings fast busy all day long so guess that was a scam. I'm tired of being upset so guess I'll drop it but if I were you I'd get flowers from a reputable local florist for your special day. Oh... and here is the kicker. After we left our house on the wedding, a box of flowers showed up from Costco. A family member still at the house had to turn them away since we already made other arrangements. Very sour taste in my mouth for Costco and I will think twice before shopping their warehouse for certain items.",0,1

After dealing with two other agents who gave unacceptable explanations of why my order was declined, finally Paul S, had a true investigation and found ways to correct all possible mistakes and help my order through.Dear Costco, please keep and reward your associates like Paul S, for whom I thank you.Most Sincerely,Rosem Mocan",0,5

Costco Wholesale,You can't make this up!,"I have shopped in Costco for years. I just have to share my recent experience. I update my membership to Executive Member and successfully applied for a Citi Visa. The membership desk issued me a temporary Visa card, good for a couple of weeks before I was to receive my permanent Citi Visa in the mail. This allowed me to buy a number of items that day. A few days later I decide to order a TV from Costco on-line as Costco did not have the one I wanted, in stock. I was unable to order this TV as the Temporary Visa card is only for items in stock, in person, as I had to show my ID. So I went into Costco and figured I could order the TV as my ID could be verified at the time of order. Wrong! They said I had to wait for my Citi Visa to arrive and use this to purchase it on-line. After two weeks the Cita Visa still had not arrived. I decided to get a different Costco TV, in part because they had it in stock. I arranged for a friend with a truck to meet me at Costo to help me take this 82"" TV home. I go thru the check-out line and discover that now my temporary card expired two days ago. I was sent to Membership to update the temporary card. I was told that the ""system"" rejected the update request. The lady in Membership called Citi Visa to see if they could help. They couldn't. In fact the gal I was talking to told me she didn't even know Costco issued a temporary Citi Visa. I was ready to leave for Sam's Club or Best Buy. Then, my buddy tells me that he will purchase a Costco membership and apply in Costco for his own membership/credit card to make this purchase. Problem solved? Nope. I watched him enter, re-enter, and tri-enter, etc. the required information on their touch pad. We were there about an hour, with the help of a Membership person. The keys pressed often did not enter and when they finally did enter the completed application did not submit. It took calls, overrides and other employees before my friend was able to get his pictured Ex. Membership Id and his temporary Citi Visa paper. Here's what I want you to know. Throughout this entire process everyone who tried to help us was polite and willing. But, they could not change the warehouse policy or replace the very stubborn keypads. I got my $2,800 TV. Add the unnecessary membership fee to this as my friend has no intention of returning to Costco. I'm a patient and forgiving man. This is why I give Costco 3 stars instead of 2.",0,3

Kerosene was in my tank. Now I have my receipt for the gas I purchased and Costco has cameras at the gas station. I filed a complaint with Costco to take care of the bill but the refused stating that no other complaints were filed with them so it couldn't have been their location. Now how am I suppose to know if other complaints were filed??? They don't make that information available to the public. Plus don't try to leave a negative review on their site.

Costco Wholesale,I bought a refrigerator online,"I bought a refrigerator online. Delivery scheduled in one week. It arrived very damaged, so I refused delivery. One week later, the replacement arrived. They refused to bring it in my house because my ice maker water line didn't have a shutoff valve (I had turned-off the water for the entire house, and disconnected the water line; they still refused). With no further explanation, and without them allowing me to call customer service, the delivery guy fled the scene. No words, he just hurridly fled with my new refrigerator still in his truck. No explanation, no apologies, he simply fled. I tried to stop him; he hopped in his truck, rolled-up his window, and almost ran over me as I stood in front of his truck trying to stop him. I was furious, since all of my freezer-food was in a cooler. Of course I canceled the order, and found a next-day-delivery of a similar refrigerator at Best Buy.

Costco Wholesale,Warning do NOT order appliances or large items…,"Do not order appliances or large items from Costco. They claim to stand behind their products, they offer a ""concierge"" telephone line to take care of members. We have had an LG refrigerator from Costco that is under warranty, but has not worked for 49 days and counting. We've had the same repair company sent from LG three times and have spoken to various departments between concierge and major appliance and internet within Costco upwards of 30 times to no avail. In almost every instance it was because we had to call back to try to get any resolution. In most cases the Costco departments don't talk to each other and you can only get to the appropriate department by being routed through one of the other departments. If you ask for management involvement, good luck with that. The only thing worse than Costco's response through this ordeal has been the response or lack thereof by LG. Finally after 46 days without a working fridge, that again is still under the two year warranty, and getting the constant run around from LG, Costco has agreed to take the unit back as a ""return"". However, we are still waiting to find out when they can pick the unit up. Having gone a month and a half without a working fridge, we felt no choice but to simply buy another refrigerator, which we did from Home Depot. However, when that refrigerator gets installed today (thankfully) we will be stuck with the non working unit sitting in our house until Costco can dispatch someone to pick it up. The entire experience has been pathetic to say the least.

I read him the size, and he just spouted off three tires, and said that's all I got. Then I asked him about tread wear or tread pattern. He said he didnt have all day to show me all the tire treads. Yet he just told me there were only three tires that he carried. Then he said a quick price. I didnt know if that was mounted and balanced installed or anything. I felt he was rude, belittling and not a good sales person. What made it worse is he looked to be the manager of the tire desk. Wearing a white shirt.I turned to the lady behind me and she had a look of shock in her face. I just clearly stated I would never spend any money with costco, and he was a terrible service consultant. I have worked as a mechanic and service desk provider/ consultant for almost 25 years.. and I would never have treated anyone like I was treated today.

I ordered a Loft Bed (Epoch Design) through Costco Online and it's a month later and no delivery. I am disappointed at Costco as I thought that they backed up their customers and not the vendors. Costco could do nothing to help escalate the delivery and could not even have the vendor re-ship the merchandise to make it right. I cannot believe that I would ever experience such terrible customer service with Costco. If you need furniture purchase from the store and never ONLINE. All they can do is apologize and you still remain waiting for the order.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Dishwasher installer can't plug it in,I ordered a dishwasher to be delivered and installed. It took two weeks for them to get here and they installed it without plugging it in the GFI outlet directly behind the dishwasher. So it won't work. They also said they couldn't connect it the water supply without a hose to convert it from 1/2 to 3/8. This hose was still connected to the old dishwasher still sitting on site. When will people realize it's more expensive to send an minimum wage idiot out 3 times than have a qualified person come once.,0,1

Costco Wholesale,Very Poor Concierge Service,"I bought a Surface Pro 4 from Costco because it has an extended services to two years. The problem was the Surface Pro would not turn on. It has been about a month and Costco has not successfully fixed it. Then I was told they should send me a replacement (Microsoft Certified) and a packing for me to send the defective Surface Pro back. The day the replacement supposed to arrive, I received an empty box. I called and the guy said that's for the packing and another box of containing the replacement should arrive on the same day. Nothing came. The next day some one else said I had to send the defective in first before they can send me a replacement. This in itself is a very poor management and services from Costco. When asked how long it would take, Costco said there's no time limit for them to inspect the defective unit to make sure I am qualified for replacement. Apparently, Costco does not care about how this impact the customer. No apology from the person on the call. This is not the kind of service I expect from Costco. This is not driving customers to Costco. This is not making my buying stuff from Costco again.",0,1

I ordered a few items on line, never got one item and couldn't find a way to report it was not received.

No estimated delivery time, didn't actually get delivered on they day they had put on the order tracker. Waiting another day and the parcel arrived right at the end of the day. No warning. Customer service at Costco and UPS is pathetic and completely unhelpful. I'd rather pay more and have peace of mind and customer service. I'm disgusted that they think they can charge you for such pathetic service and experience. I don't know any other online company that doesn't provide you with some guidance around expected delivery time. There's no sense of urgency from Costco that the delivery is 2 days late and they need to apply more pressure to UPS. Lost out financially waiting for my order that is now not worth it!",0,1

We have about 28, 000 miles. We have been there with problems all winter long . Muy care slipped in the rain because of our tires. When I went back to the Costco tires shop they told us we needed more miles on our tires before they could be replaced. I used them for a couple of months then I went for an inspection and my vehicle failed inspection because my tires were in poor shape and at least two of them has to be replaced.When we went to Costco they wanted to charge us for the new tires never mind the tires, They offered us some kind of discount if we gave them back. They were rude and unprofessional complaining about customers and their problems. I went to speak to the store manager about their problems they refused to take responsibility. They also told us that we had to have an alignment done but I never did an alignment with my own tires and they lasted 50,000 miles. They told us they did not do alignment even though they told it was a full-service agreement.

Costco Wholesale,I made the error of using the Costco…,"I made the error of using the Costco online service. I didn't realize they didn't take responsibility for the things they sell on the website. I purchased an outdoor patio set made by RST Brand on March 10th. It was delivered on April 10th with a shattered top to the fire table. I purchased it specifically for my wife's memorial service we held at our home on April 14th. The shipping company blamed RST, saying most of the stuff shipped to them for delivery is broken or missing pieces. I called Costco and they told me ""its an RST item and not a Costco problem, that's how it works"". I called RST and have not had any luck getting the replacement piece for the table. Its April 18th and I am left with 6 huge boxes sitting on my patio. I didn't have comfortable seating for the older people who attended the memorial service. Worst of all during the worst and most challenging portion of my life, they have given me a part time job of trying to get the broken piece of the set to my house and assembled. Its heartless. I explained it to one Costco employee and she said ""people die, not our problem... call RST and tell them about it"". April 18th - I called the delivery company today, they have contacted both Costco and RST several times and received no response from either. I called Costco and they said it is an outside vendor and they cant and wont do anything to help me (but she did wish me ""good luck"". I called RST and the women who answered (Jessica) said her records show the item was delivered without issue and showed no notes in my account. I have spent easily 3 hours on the phone with RST from April 10th to today. Costco sells items online they don't stand behind, the companies who are third party vendors blame Costco and disappear and the delivery company is stuck being blamed for everything but are powerless to do anything. I have called everyone... I don't know what to do. I would never buy using Costco online again.

Costco Wholesale,Staten Island Costco customer service is horrible,The customer service desk at the Staten Island location is horrible. The attitude of the entire staff was very disappointing. They were accusing me of keeping a carafe to the Keurig coffee pot that I had purchased in January. This model DID NOT come with a carafe. I explained that to them and they continued to be rude and accusing. It was embarrassing. After the 2nd supervisor came over they were able to see that the model I returned did not come with the carafe. When I said to the gentleman helping me “ you’re embarrassing me “ you’re treating me like I stole something in front of a line of customers. His reply was “ lady it would be more embarrassing if I lost my job” I walked out of there completely disgusted and went and bought my new coffee pot at Target.

Costco Wholesale,Costco's horrible online order services.,"It is sad to join the many people on here for Costco online ordering but they have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I ordered a desk that was ""out for delivery"" on the 3/16 they never called, the distribution facility had this item with them for 5 days and finally I called to see where the package went. They linked me to the distributer and I scheduled a deliver date, they never showed up. I called Costco to handle this and they kept trying to give me the run around, they told me that they will get in touch with the delivery dispatchers, NO ONE COULD REACH THEM. Where did the driver go? Costco then said that a customer specialist will get in touch with me the next day and that there were no supervisors on the floor to speak to and that they had all gone home? What!? How are you running a business operation with no available supervisor? I got the number for the dispatcher and left a message to them to call me the next day. NO ONE CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY. So I called Costco again, and they said the best thing they could do was escalate the delivery, and to have this magical customer specialist call me about reimbursements. Finally a day later this customer service specialist called, and had the audacity to argue with me that they have 3 weeks to deliver a package, how do you then explain that the package was already ready to be delivered, and all that they could offer was $100 missed delivery voucher if I kept the item, so I decided to take that offer and reschedule my delivery. Did it show up the second time... NO it did not! How do you operate an online business like this? This is why ToysRUs went out of business. NEVER ORDER ONLINE HERE!!!

Costco Wholesale,NEVER BUY FROM COSTCO FURNITURE,"Terrible! Never ever buy furniture from Costco online that requires installation. I waited a month for a bedframe to arrive and cleared my day when they showed up (Saturday). When they came, the deliverymen noticed the boxes were already opened and the hardware pieces were missing. The deliverymen also told me this was not the first time this has happened. Last weekend, when delivering another bedframe to a customer who pruchased from Costco, they noticed it did not come with hardware pieces. Fortunately, the man decided to build it himself with screws he has lying around!!! Anyways they told me I can either take this as is....or return everything back. They were pressuring me to make a decision fast, and did not want to wait while I called Costco customer support (30 min wait time) so I told them to take it back! When I called Costco support, they told me they will leave a voicemail to the vendor so that on Monday they can send over the hardware pieces missing. Of course the vendor was not open on the weekends. The rep also told me I should be expecting a call from the vendor Monday. When Monday came around, no one ever called me. So when I called on Monday to follow up, the Costco support person noted nothing was done...and that he saw notes from Saturday stating I only needed the hardware and not the bed frame! I had to correct him and state I currently have nothing as I sent the frames back and am sleeping on the floor. They must have everything delivered again by the end of this week or I am cancelling this order (over $2,000). The rep told me he will have them send the hardware overnight and I should be getting a call Wed from the vendor to schedule a day for them to come back out with all the pieces. He also said if no one calls by Wed, call back Costco. SO NOW it is Wed night and I never received a call from the vendor or Costco. When I called Costco the rep told me they send the hardware pieces on overnight shipping yesterday night....and that I should be getting a call tomorrow... WHAT THE F. They would have known by Monday morning from the voicemail left Saturday night by the Costco rep to send the hardware pieces!!!! Why in the hell did it take until Tuesday night for it to be sent out? Of course... I expect no one to call me Thursday and I will have to chase Costco and this vendor again!! Not professional, not consistent, no sense of urgency or concern for me (as I stated I am sleeping on the floor). And all the reps keep telling me, just wait until they call you (on Monday, Wed, and now supposedly tomorrow Thursday). And they expect me to just wait for another week for when they find a date to come back and install the bedframe?",0,1

I purchased an extended warranty for his as well, but since it had been 90 days since purchase, Costco sent me to their concierge service who helped very little and just forwarded us to Vizio who basically called us liars and said there was nothing they could do because the TV was damaged. The TV was not damaged, only watched which is what I assumed was a television's purpose.

Its a lie!!! I purchased an LG refrigerator and paid well over $3500 for it. After just 1 1/2 years the compressor failed...Result LG (the brand which is a piece of junk) would not honor the two year warranty and gave me a number of an appliance repair company to contact for me to pay on my own. That company was out of business...they actually gave it to me twice. I have been on the phone for hours trying to get someone to help both at LG and Costco. Calls are not returned and now it has been almost two weeks my family has had no refrigerator..thus no food in the home.

TODAY get an email that the set is on backorder and PROBABLY will ship the week of Christmas (yeah, right), and now that competitors' Black Friday sales are over. Costco assures me that if I don't like that delivery date, I can call and they will TRY to cancel my order. Not that they will cancel it, only that they will try. Or I can email them, but there's no reply email address in their message to me or on the ""Contact Us"" page that the message links to. So, I call and am again am given a hold time of 30+ minutes.

Here we are and its 12/3 and 9 business days (not counting weekends or thanksgiving. Seriously! So disgusted with the customer service I have received. I have waited an hour at least to talk to someone and they have been unhelpful. The first call he turned it over to another department and told me they would call within 24-48 hours. The second call I made because no one called me back I was then told that weekends doesn't count (in the 24-48hrs). Basically, I wont have my coat by the 6th and I desperately needed it. So disappointed with the lack of customer service provided by Costco.com. And disgusted that they billed my account on 11/22 and now 12 days later the coat is nowhere to be found????

If their orders were handled correctly so one didn't need to contact customer service it would be tolerable, but they aren't.

Can you imagine an item that shipped on the 24th of November from CA wouldn't arrive to UT (which is so close to CA) before December 4 or 5?, I tried calling Costco customer service but it says there's high call volume, asked me to leave my phone number and I wont lose my turn in line, they called after 48 min and said"" sorry there's technical error and hanged up on me, they did the same exact thing next day, there was no way to get a hold of their customer service over 3 days in a row and finally I stayed over the phone for 50 min and spoke to a real person who said: he was sorry and offered to cancel the order, that easy. That's how Costco treats its customers, my advice is to never ever use Costco.com to shop online, grab it form the store or try other famous websites, it is the worst customer service ever and they use the worst transport company in the nation that never respects customers nor their commitment for delivery they set. That TV was on Wal-Mart, Best Buy and other sites but now it is not on sale anymore, I lost the chance for a great discount simply because I trusted Costco.com that never respected me.",0,1

Google ""Customer Churn"" (or go toward end regarding sesrching. This site doesn't allow links) if one isn't aware of this term given there are soooo... many terms in the world... note: there have been other negative experiences I have had recently.1 star is generous. I was mocked by the GM. Other employees rolled eyes, smirked, and one even did the circle around the temple indicating ""crazy "". This was a degrading, belittling, and disgusting experience. Yes, I have the names. A few . Dang, Ashley, Renee.I have been a STRONG advocate for Costco. However, in the last year to year and a half the products, service have sunk so much at the Maplewood, MN location. The new GM was to be the great hope! Yet he was the one mocking me. No wonder the members of the staff behaved this way given the role model.The interesting point is how I have sent several comment cards to HQ regarding the improvements. Even included feedback on some of the quality employees that I have interfaced with over the last 3 years since becoming a member. AND even though I have 3 sisters who are members, some for quite a time, I still elected to purchase a membership vs. shopping with them, or having them order items for me (of course with prompt reimbursememt). The irony is Woodbury Coscto just opened a couple of days ago. In fact, I drove by to see the new site the day before. The gas station was open earlier, 1 hour before I drove in. Even the day before grand opening. It was great I was able to fill up, and I was thrilled to have a new location! My comments to many people have been, well, I bet Sam's Club is nervous given Costco is now in their town.I met Art the new GM while at the MN State Fair at the promo booth for WOODBURY new location. He had been transferred to the new store from Burnsville. John (he had become more snippy over time) the GM at Maplewood was transferred back to Burnsville as GM to replace Art. HENCE, the new GM Mike at Maplewood. I heard great things about him from one of their long-term employees. This employee Jim?, gas station mgr and very good at job from tactical to strategic and customer service, was very complimentary of Mike and Mike's working up the ladder from frontline to now GM.Anyway, is this type of customer experience (CX) being trickled down from upper management, including Seattle HQ? I found this is often the issue due to a disconnect between frontline ""reality"" and those in the glass offices. I had hope(d) this would not be the case with Costco.So, my suggestion:Google getfeedback blog customer experienceMoreover, I have been a STRONG supporter of brick and mortar stores. Especially, those companies that also have a dot com arm. And are US based. GOOGLE investopedia costco sinks amazon fears overshadowHum.. and to think I had considered working at Costco. Thank heaven I didn't do that because I am obviously crazy! AND I guess if a customer wants to have at least a good if not great CX, then YES, call me crazy for wanting to have above average quality, great customer service, normally a great return policy... so if I am crazy for wanting that, that's fine. I am sure there are other companies out there where CX is worth spending $$. NOTE by 2020 CX will be the determining factor for customer retention, brand, goodwill, BUT it was predicted that 2017 would be the start-up/ramp-up of the companies that really want to be the best rated. Maybe the writing is on the wall.NOTE. I also like Costco because of their dedication to employees, holidays, BUT it seems as though some of the employees think THEY are making a great salary/hourly because they are superb. Confused, they make a great rate because they are supposed to be providing superb CS. Cart before the horse.Guess I will start packing up items purchased there (Guess refund on 4 tires not doable ) because one of the reasons to buy from COSTCO is the return policy. BUT this return policy is ONLY applicable if one is still a member. CHURN..well guess that loyalty plan I had in mind is futile now. Better return..Thanks!",0,1

What B.S.Another thing: Managers chit-chatting with their buddies while the lines pile up to the point where I have to wave my arms and yell: ARE YOU GOING TO OPEN MORE CHECK STANDS OR NOT???!!!Another thing: The guy explains to me that it's ""The spirit of your return that is in question.""???!!!

I normally dislike those stock phrases, but would have welcomed them yesterday at the Costco Covington, WA store. Both the cashier and the guy loading up my cart were so involved in their own conversation, I had to try to get their attention just to get a couple of boxes for my purchases. Even after I paid there was no ""Thank you, have a good day."" This store might benefit from Corporate sending in a secret shopper. Or maybe Costco no longer cares about its customers.

A couple months ago, the cashier asked for my driver's license even though I had my membership card with me. The cashier looked at me like the membership card is not mine and that I did not look like I cannot afford that type of membership. Yesterday, I shopped at Costco again and the cashier told me that my membership has expired. I told her that my husband has already renewed it on line. The cashier, Zulma, gave me a nasty look like I was lying. She even told me than I need to keep my receipt because as a nonmember I would need it to return any of the merchandise that I bought. I then asked her why would she say I was a ""nonmember"" when my husband already renewed our membership? She gave me lame excuses and of course her manager did not do much to help. I came home and asked my husband about the membership renewal and he did renew it and showed me the receipt. Why would Costco allow people to renew membership on line and not a record in their system? Are they hoping to collect double fees from people renewing their membership on line while their customers are being treated like we are some 'cheats"" trying to shop at their stores without membership? I think that these cashiers were rude and what they did were very offensive. They need to be trained!",0,2
Costco Wholesale,Bad Customer Service at Costco in Pacoima,"Went to Costco in Pacoima, CA . As we were leaving the warehouse they were doing the regular receipt check and they realized that they didn't charge us for the case of beer. So, they made us wait on the side. They kept asking us if we wanted the beer several times and we repeatedly said yes and asked where we can go and pay for it? A manager sent my husband towards the registers. My husband went and waited for someone to show up for about another 10 minutes. You would think Costco would find the way to facilitate a fast way to pay since they made the mistake but on the contrary they never apologized for their mistake. We got tired of waiting with our 5 and 10 year olds and decided to leave without the beer. We never had any problems with this particular Costco but this incident really makes me doubt about their customer service which actually it sucks! And what made it even worse is that fact that nobody acknowledged their mistake and offer an apology. I don't know if I'm coming back to this Custco again.",1,1

When I told her I was almost 18 ( turn 18 next month) she said that I'm not even old enough to shop there. So apparently I'm old enough to own my own car and drive me and my sister there, but I'm not old enough to buy some milk and dog food.

Above these things, we need to pay annual membership as well. This was my last visiting although my card has not been expired yet. The products prices are not at all also competitive so I believe very soon or late the most businessmen will be boycotting Costco...Shame on the board of directors who have forgotten the real objectives of the company and obviously their shareholder's strategies which should be maintaining customers with good customer satisfaction to maximise profitability.

I disagreed since the lenses still in very good condition and I will not replace them if they can get the same frame for me. After the phone conversation with the optical manager, I was told that the lenses was also considered as normal wear and tear because they are 18 months old and Costco Optical is whole sale place not general store.

Costco Wholesale,online purchase of bed furniture at costco.ca,"Shopping at Costco.ca was quick,easy and exciting. If all goes as planned, you would be glowing with glee. But once there is an issue with the order, you will be in trouble. The way Costco communicates is with their email system blurting out standardized comments/notes from their resolutions department. Both tieir 1 and tier 2 level representatives all need further training in customer service. For every one of their emails, I call back to talk to one of the resolutions staff as I like to ensure communication is clearer via calling than through emails. (hint Costco)I never leave bad reviews and rarely make complaints, but this one was one of the worst experiences ever. This is not an isolated case as I spoke with 3-4 resolutions staff and NOT ONE followed through on what was discussed. I simply asked them to ship out the product to each of these representatives and NOT one followed it through. Regrettably, in the end I simply asked for a refund over the course of waiting over 4 months for delivery of my item. What kind of retail company is advised by a customer to ship out the product but multiple staff at Costco will not initiate the shipment and keep emailing me if I am still interested in the product??? The odd thing is, once I requested a refund, that was followed through within 1 day!!!!! My case is so obviously easy to review with Costco as the emails and all the notes have been confirmed by Costco showing both comments and the staff who took down the notes. Everytime I called, they all sounded sympathetic and understood the frustration I am going through once they read all the notes, but each of these staff add themselves to that very list of not following through. I've asked multiple times to ship it out, they all happily oblige and apologize for the delay, but nada, no shipment!Very very very disappointed in Costco.

Costco Wholesale,Excellent Appliance Ordering Experience,"There are many negative reviews here, so I am compelled to share a positive one. We needed a gas slide in range and microwave. Costco.com came in $177 cheaper than Lowes, and much cheaper than Home Depot, who would not even match local competitors on the GE Profile items we chose. Ordering was painless, and the delivery estimate was spot-on. The only minor complaint I have is not being able to track the shipping progress. A tracking number of sorts was provided, but it was not clickable, and there was no indication as to who the carrier would be.Turns out the carrier was Daryl Flood. I've seen a number of negative reviews for them, but their delivery was as promised. The automated system called the evening before delivery with a four hour window of 9-1, and a number to call if that window was unsuitable. The driver/installer team called shortly before 9, and arrived about 45 minutes later.After bringing the appliances inside, we found the range, despite being a 30"" model like the one we replaced, was slightly too wide to fit in the allotted space. The guys apologized for not being able to wait for me to fix this, as they had 15 more deliveries that day. They said we could arrange to have another installer come out once I had fixed the cabinet clearance issue. I wound up installing it myself, as I had originally planned, as was the case with the microwave. I knew I was going to have to remove a portion of tile backsplash for that, and needed the unit to be delivered to determine exactly how much to remove.All in all, I found the process to be exactly as promised and expected.",0,5

The reason for this has simply been bad fitting from the Costco Tire Centre. Rims need to be cleaned before being placed and anti-seize needs to be applied. Both actions were not taken by Costco Kanata Tire Centre. I realize that I can have free service from the Tire Centre but that should not mean lower standard of service. Now, I have to contact the Tire Centre again (if they ever answer their phones) to rearrange another appointment so that they can take off my tires. However, I feel increasingly anxious about being served by Costco and angry that I cannot rely on a proper job done.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Yesterday my mother and I were insulted …,"Yesterday my mother and I were insulted and belittle by a greeter named James at the costco in Miami Lakes. The guy yanked the cart out of my hand, and when my mother was offering the receipt he proceeded to banter back and forth with us. The GM apologized but not before saying ""I know James he has worked here for years and nothing like that has ever happened"". Leaving me to untrustworthy. However once corporate was called the manager apologized to both my mother and I. Very disappointed in the treatment that was received.",1,1
Costco Wholesale,Hours wasted trying to locate my delayed Cost.com order,"I purchased a tandem kayak. The quoted delivery time was 7-10 days. No email to indicate that there would be any delay with the item was received. Two weeks later I called to enquire where it was. Requested a callback rather than hold for 20 minutes estimated hold time. The callback didn't come until 50 minutes later and rang off in less than 5 seconds (apparently it's a new system they are trying out). I called again and had to wait 44 minutes on hold to talk to an agent. The order had not even shipped because the vendor 'was behind'. It will 'probably' ship tomorrow by GROUND from UTAH to TEXAS and Costco cannot even estimate when it will arrive, ""maybe next week"". Crystal the supervisor in WA was very nice and offered to speak with the vendor but stated there was no way to accelerate delivery due to the cost of this bulky item. She stated that Ground shipping was also the safest way to ship, yet looking at online reviews most criticisms relate not to the kayak itself but to damage in transit. Costco normally offers a reasonable service but they really dropped the ball on the order, supervision of the vendor's response to the order, and particularly the way that members are expected to devote a significant portion of their day just to figure out what is going on. So, bottom line, 'fulfillment' didn't happen and my my young daughter won't be kayaking this weekend either",0,1
Costco Wholesale,The Twin Falls Idaho Costco is a joke,"The Twin Falls Idaho Costco is a joke. I have been mistreated not once but three times. This last time I went in with my husband. He has a card and I have a card. I had left mine home for whatever reason. We got all our items and when we got up to the checkout line I decided to go get hot-dogs for us and our toddler and left the hub to checkout(with my card). They got everything through and when he went to use my card they said they could not complete the transaction because the membership card did not match the payment card. (It had the same last name) Even though we are on the same membership contract, same household, we even both have pictures with our son in both pictures they refused to use my card. We called the manager over and he said he will let it slide this one time. He described it as a ""speeding ticket"" and said you can do that but at some point you will get caught and ""that sucks."" Long story short, one store ruined it for me. Why are you punishing YOUR customers?",0,1

Costco Wholesale,"Customer service at Costco in Kailua Kona, HI","My mom has always wanted to shop at Costco so we went in and paid the membership fee only to be greeted with one rude employee after another. Every time my family and I go in to shop we get harassed to check for cards which we carry in our hand. Nearly every time we've been there we end up with a rude cashier who speaks with the most snobbish attitude. I've never been to a store who treats their customers with this little regard. I always dread going to the Costco in Kailua Kona, HI and leave with a bad attitude due to their poor customer service. Membership fees are ridiculous, prices are subpar, range and quality of products are disappointing. Would not recommend to anyone who wants to shop at the Kona location.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Customer Service is Dead,"I was at my neighborhood Costco in Maple Grove, MN. At checkout the cashier, Drew and the girl who was putting the food in the cart, Megan were so busy chatting with each other that neither made eye contact or acknowledged my presence even when handing Drew my card. He didn't address me until he was ready to ask me if I'd be willing to donate money to a charity. At that point I ignored both of them for the duration of checkout. Megan was thoughtful enough to put my rotisserie chicken in my cart upside down. Saw that when I got to my car. Customer service is dead.",0,2

When I called Costco.com and asked if we could pick it up they said no it is a liability for us to pick up there. Every time we have called they give us a different story about why and when they can deliver. Nothing like being held hostage by Costco.

It had been maybe a half hour. One of the other workers brought my car up front and I was soon on my way.

Costco Wholesale,Terrible delivery!,Couldn't agree more that the delivery from Costco.com is the worst experience we ever experienced. This is the first order we made with Costco.com. We have been Costco members for over ten years and have always been their fan. This experience has changed it for sure. They gave us a delivery window of 9-1. Then call us at 1 pm that they will be late. Why can't they call earlier so I could have done so much for this 4 hours of my precious weekend time?! I can't understand why can't they schedule it better so as not to waste their customers time waiting. I guess they think their time is more valuable than ours. It is really time to take a serious thought to improve this. It is not a hard thing to do at all.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Terrible Customer Service,"I have been shopping at Costco for many years now. I have never been treated so badly by a cashier until my visit there today. After renewing my membership and spending 400$ on groceries I was short 20$. My daughter handed me her credit card and the cashier raised her voice at us to tell us that was not okay. I understand the rules, but it was either put something back, or have her cover the 20$. As I tried to politely explain this to the cashier she continuously cut me off and would not listen. I have never been treated so rudely by a cashier there before and from that experience I'm upset that I renewed my membership.",0,1

They said they would try to intercept shipping.This did not happen. I ultimately had to have a neighbor at old address pick up and resend it, cost me an additional $30.00. The customer service representative was rude, and did nothing more than waste my time. I will never order anything again on this site.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Hard time getting refund for laundry detergent,"I finally received my $15.19 refund for laundry detergent. It was not put in my basket last week after purchasing a lot of groceries. What a pain to get home on Sunday early eve and not have laundry detergent for the stacks of dirty clothes, right? So today, I was at a different location, and went to a Red Vest, explained and asked for a refund on my Executive Costco membership and Visa. The Red Vest asked me which location do I shop often, I asked her why does it matter? She said Costco policy is to return to the same location for a refund because of inventory differences. She hesitated to start my transaction. That is a Crock of Crap! It is Kirland free and clear laundry detergent! After I told her I was un willing to travel 1.5 hr to other location. She gave me refund. I will follow up with Corporate office to see if it is policy.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco Online offers services they do not provide,"I ordered a 2000.00 + wood swingset by Yardline (Yardline Play Systems Ultra Fortress II Playset - Installation Included Item #726281)on 3/9/2017. I was happily surprised when the COSTCO WEBSITE asked if I would like to have installation for 200.00! Wow, I thought, I don't have to find someone to put this together for me, after all, being a 47 year old woman (with a heart condition) who is getting this for her 6 year old granddaughter, this is wonderful! So yes please, add that! Order went thru and money is taken from my bank to pay for it. Imagine my surprise 5 days later when I get a confirmation email that I have cancelled the order????? What??? Why would I do that, I have told the 6 year old little girl it is coming and she will be able to play on it in about a month! So I ASSUME it is some kind of mistake. I call Costco customer service and a very kind lady informed me that the offered installation is not available in Spokane so COSTCO cancelled my order. No phone call to see if I possibly wanted it without the OFFERED BY COSTCO installation. NOPE, they just cancel it. Oh and even better, I get to wait at least 3 days for them to return my 2100.00! Seriously, Customer service is not even capable of reinstating the order they cancelled without the installation. I guess its time to get a Rainbow system, or Home Depot! Costco should fix the website to NOT offer things that they cannot provide, at bare minimum, make a phone call!",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Outstanding Customer Service? Not!,"We have been Costco members for many years with only minor issues but otherwise fairly good service. On our last visit on Feb 22, 2017, however, we were treated rather rudely in regards to getting some passport photos. The store was scheduled to close in 45 minutes but the rep in the photo department said that they could not take the photos and have them processed before store closing (we would have to come back the next day to pick them up). Instead, we left the store, went over to London Drugs and had the photos taken and done in less than ten minutes. The Costco policy for processing passport photos is not stated anywhere that I can find. You would think that since members pay a lot for their membership that the service reps would try to help you out as best they can but sadly that is not the case. We were very disappointed - we will not being renewing our membership when it comes due.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Appalling Service,"This is specifically for the Reading store. The only staff that seem alright are ones on the way out checking your tickets. Even then they don't always really check anything - but that's another story.The food area is undescribably appalling, but I'll try. Today (19/02/17), a Costco staff in hi-viz jacket jumped the queue, appearing to be going in to fix something only for me to see him ordering food. All we wanted was ice cream. The lady at the till just dumped it on the till. Then we asked for sauces, and she just (rudely) splashed something on it without asking or saying it was. Well turns out my son couldn't even have it - we went to mcDonalds afterwards (which I normally don't go to) and was delighted by the service. I won't be renewing my membership, as I've also realised the things we buy are really not much cheaper than Sainsbury's, and there's also the yearly fee.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,I would leave less,Tried to go into Sandy Costco to see what prices were like to see if we would want a membership there and they refused to even let us through the doors to look around.

I'd leave no stars but you can't do that. Horrible experience. Will never go back.,0,1
Costco Wholesale,Don't but the Yakitori Chicken,"Their Ajinomoto Yakitori Chicken repeatedly gets recalled due to Listeria. Yet Costco continues to carry it. To qualify for a Costco refund, you have to return the actual product to their store, then wait in line. It is easier to throw the stuff away. So I guess the reason that Costco keeps selling it, is because they still make a profit off it, regardless if you die from Listeria or not.",0,2
Costco Wholesale,Discriminate towards disabled people by refusing to respond to emails and social media staff copy paste responses without reading anything,They sold me a defective item. I emailed them multiple times and no one responds. I tried asking for help on Facebook as I figured they would message their customer service team to get this resolved. But nope. Told me to use a phone or email despite being aware I cannot use a phone and no one responds to my emails. So they only help you return items of you can use a phone. Under the UK laws you have to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people AND you have to accept customer communication via the method you sold the product. So for online sales you have to accept and respond to emails. I'll have to now do a chargeback and hope my card company covers me for this £79 defective item. I just hope nothing else I ordered has a defect as I've owned over £2000 with this in the last 12 months.,0,1

Costco Wholesale,"customer service dreadful, never buy a service from them","Quite frankly I am hugely disappointed. This is supposed to be a multi national name, who don't care at all about their customers. If you buy on line then you have to have speak to the US who will promise to call you back but of course never do! They hide behind the fact that the ""home office"" hasn't come back to them - but I have bought from Costco.co.uk!!!So my recommendation - avoid, avoid, avoid, just take your money and don't care - my membership will not ever be renewed! I am now on my third promise of ""we will call you back"" - time will tell. The reason for the complaint is excessive overcharging for CCTV installation. Website states that additional costs will be agreed prior to installation, I got the shock of additional costs half way through installation at the point of no return - I really had no choice but to pay - very unethical!!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,SOME form of Express Lane Necessary,"None of your rewards for survey participation are items which most people I know are interested in. My purpose for completing the survey was only to express as completely as I can your blatant disregard for the use of SOME form of express lane for customer checkout. I know dozens of friends and neighbors who feel as I do who will not, cannot, or choose not to use your service for other than gas purchases, as well as employees of Costco as well. Why do you not care to recognize the need for members to purchase fewer items (or perhaps more frequently) who simply may not have the time to wait in a long line to buy these fewer items? If you really want to ""improve"" your services, please open some form of express line, or allow members to pay at the customer service desk as other Costo stores do. Finally, I recently mentioned this issue to a customer service representative at Costco as I checked out who seemed to understand my frustration but only said ""Good luck with THAT!""",0,2

Costco Wholesale,Costco at Docklands in Melbourne has very bad customer service attitudes,"We went shopping at Costco during the week to avoid the usual weekend crowds. There were not many shoppers so going through the isles was a breeze. After making payment at the register with our goods, we proceeded to the dining area to buy something to eat & to also change nappy for our baby at the toilets. However after a quick peruse of the docket I found we had been incorrectly overcharged for 3 boxes of nappies, so we quickly returned to the register to have the error corrected. I spoke to the cashier & supervisor about the mistake & they concurred & directed me to the refunds area as they couldn't do the refund here at the register. So another customer service personel then took us to the refunds desk which was next to the exit point of the shop. There another assistant at the exit point checked off the items in the trolley against the receipt, even though the customer service guy who was with us explained to the female assistant that we had to get a refund for an incorrect charge.So anyway we proceeded to the refund counter and the supervisor who we initially spoke to came over for the required authorisation for the refund. So up to now everything was fine & the mistake was sorted. We still wanted to get something to eat & change the baby's nappy.However when we then tried to re-enter the shop via the exit point, which is right next to the refunds counter, this is where the customer service assistant from 'hell' appeared & we were treated like criminals!She was an older lady & she spoke 'down' at us as though we had done something wrong saying that once we had pass this exit point we were not allowed back in with our trolley. I tried to explain to her what had happened to us with the refund & why we needed to go back in for the nappy change & buy food to eat. But she was stubborn & adamant we were not allowed back in. By now she had created a big scene at the exit point & we felt very embarressed & stressed with this lady berating us in front of the other customers who were queuing to go out. We went home afterwards feeling very distressed about the whole incident. This is such a shame cause only last week we were in the US for a about a month; where we visited Costco frequently for our grocery shopping & found the customer service there very friendly & went out of their way to assist with whatever we enquired. Obviously there seems to be a stark contrast in customer service here in Australia.There is alot of room for improvement in the area of 'customer service' here at the Melbourne store! They could learn a thing or two from the US stores....Unfortunately with this awful experience we will no longer be going to Costco & will cancel our yearly membership.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,TAX scam,"TAX SCAM --- Charging you more sales taxes than shouldI was attempting to purchase a sell item prices at 1,299 (discounted 400). I noticed that Costco Charges a tax on the prediscounted amount. Alabama tax code with dept of revenue does states that manufacturer coupons the amount of tax will be the prediscounted amount supposedly different from called ""in store"" coupon where tax is on the discounted amount. yet no where on the advertisement is anything about manufacturer discount. Having speaking to Alabama Dept of Revenue, waste of time, not worth there effort to audit costco about this. If sales shows $1699 - 400 off and your cost is 1299. then you should pay tax on 1299 instead paying tax on 1699. Huge scam. beware of COSTCO.. I bet the additional sales tax is never seen by the state of alabama. Just another way consumer getting screwed over by big company. I emailed that Costco Tax department several times and they could not show any justification for this SCAM. other than it is a manufacturer coupon. Which should only apply if the consumer take the rebate, therefore sales price will be the pre discounted amount.",0,1

Costco products look cheap but a lot are drop shipped and if they dont arrive or you have an issue, you will be left dealing with this customer service team that you will have to constantly chase, who cannot actually do anything and they cant contact the real supplier.

Costco not only waived the overnight shipment fee for sending the order to our house (which incidentally was about $50 in cost to them), they also requested for the order to be expedited so I could get them in time to give to the family member. What's more, I messed up on the initial order so had to cancel and re-order the entire shipment the next time. Costco graciously re-did the whole order without complaint, and I received the order well in time before the family member left the country, all for $40 plus tax.

Then I called Costco Concierge Service and talked with Garrett, who viewed this as a personal challenge, which was GREAT because he spent over 2 hours on the phone fixing it!! Can you imagine?? If they'd give me the address there I'd send him cookies but they are probably scared I'm a stalker. The monitor connection was so messed up and we tried and tried and finally it worked. (I totally would have returned it but was looking for something very specific to help keep tabs on our autistic son.) It never would have worked with the directions the Samsung rep gave me. Samsung has the worst customer service, there are literally thousands of complaints. But now I know why! So, Garrett, thank you thank you thank you so much. I cannot believe you took all that time and had all that patience! I will never, never buy another electronic anywhere else.",0,5
Costco Wholesale,Always a Great Experience at a Great Savings,"I've only shopped in the store, so my review isn't related to any online purchase. Every Costco I've ever been in has been a positive buying experience. Their staff is friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Their products are typically of a higher caliber and sold at a discounted price. This is the place to go if you're making a large purchase, throwing a party or just have a large family.",0,5

Essentially, I didn't realise it but it wasn't costco I bought from - the company who delivered it messed up and delivered wrong product.

I'm being led down the garden path by this other company, who keep promising my new product will arrive ""tomorrow"" and Costco are doing nothing to help me.

Costco Wholesale,Worst ever online purchase experience,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!Bought a dispenser on 9/1/2016.I have never received it and probably they never sent it.The tracking was invalid.I called more than 10 times within 2 weeks, to find out what is happening and ""they were trying to contact their supplier and he never reply to them"" !!!After this I cancelled my order and after 3 weeks I haven't received my refund yet.Maybe their supplier is not replying again!!!I am fed up with them! This is my first bad review ever for a seller!Avoid this company!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Worst ever online purchase experience. [SORTED OUT],"[EDIT 10th Feb 2016: After writing this review, someone senior from Costco UK tracked down the order and rang my friend. He apologised profusely. He said he would send her the duvet without delay and also refund the money because of the extreme hassle she had experienced. Both these things have no happened and all is well.]A friend and I order 2 Snuggledown duvets from Costco's online store in January 2016 using my friend's Costco account. We waited 2 weeks before we got a delivery, despite being promised 3-5 days. This was largely down to an incomplete address being supplied to the delivery company.Just looking at the parcel gave us a sinking feeling. Sure enough, there only one duvet present. This was exceedingly frustrating but Costco were informed the very next morning. They promised a replacement would be sent. And then it all went wrong. Weeks have gone by. They said it was despatched from Norway (presumably Snuggledown) and the suppliers had insisted 2 were sent. They tried to say we had to take it up with the supplier, and we had to point out that in law the contract was with Costco and our contract is solely with them. Still they prevaricated, insisting that 2 duvets had been despatched in one parcel, often taking days to respond to emails. In the end, we had to contact Trading Standards for advice on what to do. Even after that, their latest email today suggests that it's our fault. Snuggledown put that the parcel weighed 10kg (it didn't because one duvet doesn't) and - here's the thing - my friend had signed for the parcel without checking its weight, and its weight was (allegedly) stated somewhere on the delivery sticker. Or maybe it's my fault, since I was there too and I should have rushed out to the hall and told her to weigh before signing. Because everyone has a set of scales at their front door and checks the weight and weighs their delivery, right? So now we've had to go back to Trading Standards. It's like banging our heads again a wall. It looks like we'll have to sue them through the Small Claims Court. :(Even though this story still isn't over, I wanted to warn people not to use COSTCO's website. If anything goes wrong, you'll have an almighty battle on your hands. AVOID Costco online at all costs. And it might be worth avoiding anything SNUGGLEDOWN too.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,My worst purchase experience EVER!!!!,"Ordered a tumble dryer online, told I would be contacted within 3 days by the delivery company to arrange a date. Had to chase Costco via email (no response). Was contacted after 7 days and 30 minutes phone call to Costco customer (don't) care. Delivery to be made after another 7 days.Item arrived, driver left,I removed packaging to find top of unit smashed. I called the logistic company 10 mins after driver had left but they said he was ""on a tight schedule today"" and could not return to pick up damaged item.Called Costco immediately (20 min wait) and reported damaged item (took another 20 mins). Was told that I could get an exchange item delivered in another 7 days time. Heard nothing from the delivery company so called them on the day the item was due to be delivered. Was told they had no delivery for me!Called Costco again (20 min wait) and asked to speak to a manager there. Eventually, got a call back from Desiree Price. She said that no order had been generated either for my replacement, or the collection of damaged item. Oh and now they were no longer in stock!This all seemed quite normal and acceptable. Well not to me! There is no comeback on this company, no route for complaint. If they think they are providing a good service they need to think again.Absolutely disgusting customer care, attitude and standards.Summary: Don't give them your business or your money because they will S##t on you.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Costco sends s 'survey' after completed return,"No other retailers has Ever questioned a return after-the-fact.Costco did.They claim it is random, yet the return of a blender triggered a sales auditor (bean counter) to ask the same questions as asked at customer service.These 'surveys' are nothing more than an admonishment to the return.They refunded my money, but the letter a week later shows their inherent greed.They essentially lost the sale, and feel it's their job to remind you of their loss.An otherwise decent company shows their true colors After the return.Thankfully, I can get a full refund on my membership, which I've had since the '80's.No need to shop where you'll later be harrassed!NEVER HAPPENED FROM ANY OTHER COMPANY.",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Absolutely disgusting!!!!!,"Ordered colour swatches for bed 3 times!!! Never got them! Had replies to my complaining emails but never any swatches! Ordered a bed online. £1700. Colour Silver Mist, which is very pale grey. Free delivery and removal of old bed. Phone call from Costco ""your Midnight bed is coming 6th Dec"". I said it better not because I did not order Midnight. I ordered Silver Mist. He said, anyway its coming!! 6th Dec, bed arrives. Wouldn't take old bed unless I gave £60 cash, but it was written down and signed for. New bed was black in colour!! And the footboard was missing. The supplier didn't give it to delivery co. Screws sticking out from end of bed!! Awful awful colour bed, not what I purchased. But they took my money!! Called Costco online next day. On hold for 45 minutes. The girl did not give a damn. Accused me of making up that I had paid for removal of old bed. She said that would not have happened!! Then she admitted the supplier had Silver Mist on the order, and I had an email confirming it too. But no apology. She said it wasn't her fault but someone would call me. Nobody bothered. I called them. Eventually spoke to a manager. He was much more sympathetic but kept telling me it was the suppliers fault. I told him my contract is with Costco, and Costco need to sort it out and Costco need to do it quickly. So, 2 weeks later, nothing. I have informed Costco I will be taking them to court and I cannot lose, but they obviously do not care. No customer service whatsoever. I only bought from them because in store is so good. It is totally different online. I will also be left wirh no bed when they take this one. But again they dont give a damn. Steer clear of them worst I have ever experienced.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Lousy assistance in buying snow tires,"I purchased a 2015 Subaru Outback, and wished to install some high quality studless tires. My wife and I have tried for the last three to four weeks to have them order tires, but to no avail.I have tried all the Costcos in a 200 mile radius (from Reno to Santa Rosa), they all say ""yeah, sure, we have them"" and when you get there, they say ""oh, yeah, well, those have to be ordered"", and after going around in circles with this ""lip service"", I find out they have no idea how to get the tires I need. One tire shop manager actually called Michelin and found tires in Michigan, but Costco won't ship them out to California.",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Non accountable for pricing,"I purchased apple cider as the display indicated that the price was $4.69. After leaving the store, I noticed that price on the receipt was incorrect, so I went back into the store to check the display which clearly showed the price was $4.69. I went to Customer Service and spoke to Alice who went to check the display. I requested to walk with her to show her where the display was and she said, ""No, wait here"". I waited 15 minutes and then Alice returned and said the display was identical to amount paid for. I asked to walk back and this time, she was fine with that for the obvious reason that they had changed the sign back to the regular price. Any other retail location would have honoured the price on the sign. NOT COSTCO. They expect the membership fee plus they treat customers like they are the one in the wrong. So, I asked to speak to a manager, and Sean appeared and said someone must have noticed the sign and changed it. I replied that someone did so they did not have to honour the Price Scanning Policy.So, check the prices at the register before you leave Costco, because they get your money, you are out of luck as they are deceitful.",0,1

I ask her to make an appointment she stands there and stairs at me. The day i go in to get my eyes checked, i go to order contacts they tell me they will be in in one week. Two weeks later i end up calling them. The first person hangs up on me. Then i called back 4 times and finally got someone. I asked what's taking so long she told me that they couldn't get anymore trials in for the year, then told me they haven't been ordered. So i told her to cancel them. I got a call back saying for me to call them and talk about getting a different prescription that wasn't going to be the same as what i needed.

Costco Wholesale,No written apology from Costco,"Do NOT buy Costco shutters!We placed an order for 7 window shutters on September 17, 2014 and the installation was not complete until 10 months later on July 15, 2015. Ten months later!After 7 months with no completion we complained to Costco headquarters, and it was the first time they were aware of any delays. Costco took full payment when the order was placed, but after 7 months were not concerned with delivery. Worse yet, Costco's accounting systems did not raise any red flags about receiving full payment yet not delivering the product. Talk about completely ignoring the customer! Once Costco headquarters has your money they no longer care about providing the shutters. During this drawn-out ordeal, Costco's factory made a manufacturing mistake, so a rush order was placed for a replacement; however, for Costco a rush order merely places you at the end of the line, even when they are correcting one of their own mistakes. The ""rush"" order took almost 4 months. You would think they'd put your rush order at the front of the manufacturing line. Like a comedy of errors, the so-called rush order correction sent from the factory was the wrong size and the wrong type of shutter! Another ""rush"" order was needed, and it took another 3 months. Numerous complaints were sent to the Costco, all of which were acknowledged for receipt, then passed around Costco headquarters, with no one providing an answer. Five people received the complaint, but not one of them responded; no one apologised for leaving our house in disarray for so long. Our biggest complaints were with operation at Costco's headquarters. Ten months to get shutters from Costco when any local company could have completed the work in a few weeks. Combined with uncaring customer service from Costco. Despite all their errors, they even held up our discount until they finished the work. Shame on Costco!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,Great value and service.,"I don't understand the low ratings for Costco. I've been shopping with them for ever and they consistently have high quality products and excellent prices with, perhaps, the best return policy in the business.My only complaint would be with their food merchandisers at my local stores. They are obsessed with 'healthy' products which means that you can't buy regular sliced salami (low sodium only), or peanuts salted in the shells or dozens of other products. They're big into uncured meats and low sodium offerings that are tasteless and a complete waste of money. There are at least 2 dozen products I can't buy any long because they now are completely flavorless. So, beside the terrible choices Costco has made regarding food products everything else is great.",0,5
Costco Wholesale,Costco Wholesale Rude customer service/Cashier.,"This complaint/review is for the customer service that I had received in this location of Costco. (Location: Sunnyvale, CA)I have been a customer for over 20 years and in that time, I can definitely tell you that I've never had any complaints or issues with their customer service. However, things have changed in the decade or so. This time my experience is with the same cashier. Her name is Cristita L (or so it says on my receipt), she's an elder woman (ages of 50s-60s) and is asian or some sort of asian ethnicity. I've come into contact with her a few times while she was ringing me up and has always had a rude tone.I have seen her being this way with other customers in the times that I came to shop here but luckily did not have her as a cashier. She would give people an attitude and give a snotty tone. It's such a disrespect!In my last encounter with her, I was shopping with my daughters, she would ask me certain things like: is this transaction together or separate, before I had a chance to answer her, she asked again but raised her voice at me. On top of that while she was ringing up an item she asked: How much is this? I told her, I didn't know and then she went and said well you should know the price of it! That was very uncalled for with her voice raised again and snobbish tone. Why not just call or have a price check, why give me an attitude? I have had this types of issues with her before where she seems to hate her job and on top of that possibly even hate the people that she is servicing.This is the only Costco and the only cashier/employee that I have had any type of issues with in my 20 years of being a member. I urge anyone that shops there to beware of this bitter elder cashier as she does not even try to be nice to her customers and even adds insult to injury. I will avoid this Costco location for good! I have never experienced such a disrespect from any other of the 3 Costcos I have shopped at: San Jose, Santa Clara (this being the newest), and Mountain View. I hope that management will do something about this lady and at least give her a pep talk of some sort. Thank you for reading!",0,1
Costco Wholesale,First and last of shopping with Costco online,"We've been shopping at Costco Gateshead for years. Brilliant service and helpful. So we never expected to have so any problems buying a lifetime shed online from a company as big as Costco. We registered, and then tried to purchase the shed, the purchase failed at the last minute. Tried it again and again, getting a message saying the card details incorrect. Tried other cards, all with the same message. We rang our Credit card company to speak to them, they told us the first sale went through. (But we never got a confirmation email from costco) tried to ring the customer services, only to be greeted by an answer phone message telling us they're not open. So we rang Monday morning the 19th April. We were basically fobbed off. Saying the money hadn't been taken, as though that's ok. Still not resolving the issue. We continued to phone, in the end giving up with the online customer don't care phone line. We started calling a number in England which they seemed to care a lot more than the American counterparts. In the end on the 24th April they ordered it again. We were supposed to get a call from the carriers within 3 working days according to the confirmation email we got. We rang back to which we were told that it's 5 working days (if thats true they need to correct their email) Anyway, still got no call after 7 days. We're still waiting to this day to find out when they'll be delivering this shed. Calling them then being asked to wait while they get someone to deal with us and we were just cut off. Would like to know what will happen if I buy something else in the meantime on my credit card, then the transaction with Costco goes through and it rejects due to insufficient funds. Will that be the start of it again :-( My advice DON'T deal with costco online.0 stars",0,1

Costco Wholesale,Carefully read the reviews before you order from costco.com,"I used to go to local Costco warehouse. It is good.Recently I tried costco.com. I have to say the total experience is very disappointing. Till now my issue is still not resolved.I ordered ""FAIRVIEW WOVEN SWING"" from costco.com back in May. Before I placed the order, I have read the reviews. There are lots of complains on how hard it is to assemble, and how someone got wrong parts again and again. For us, the chair was shipped very fast. Then it turns out - ALL of the complains are TRUE. It took 2 of us more than 2 hours to put the chair together. But at the end, it turns out some PARTS ARE MISSING!!!I called and emailed the customer service. I was told the missing parts require back order. And it would take 2 to 3 weeks. I waited. ONE MONTH later, I finally got the package. But it is unbelievable, I required totally 4 parts. I got only 1 of them!!!I called the customer service again. I was told I have to contact the one who is working on this case. I called, nobody answered the phone. I sent email, but got no response.Now I have this chair, in parts, sitting in my backyard. But no idea HOW to fix it and WHEN. Does costco.com have customer service? Don't they care about their customers?All I can say is - Costco.com, the customer service is as disappointing as its product quality control.You know how bad this customer service is? Let me show you a comparison. I ordered another home furniture from amazon.com almost at the same time. The estimated shipping date is a 3 days range. At the first day of the estimated shipping date, I didn't see the delivery notification. I contacted customer service of amazon.com. They immediately upgraded my order to 1-Day shipping with no fees!!! I got my order the next day in perfect condition!!",0,1

I called Costco, the call was answered right away by a native English speaker, who understood my problem. He called HP (the brand of the laptop), got an agent on the phone for me, and then stayed on the phone line while I explained the problem to the HP sales rep. When the rep tried to tell me that the battery was no longer under warranty, Costco stood up for me, and told HP that it should be still under warranty. The Costco agent told me I could leave the call if I wanted, and that he would have a battery fed-exed to me. Within a few days, I received a brand new battery, free of charge. What amazing service.

Costco Wholesale,A MUNCHERS DREAM BUT BE CAREFUL...,"This is one of those stores that you walk into intending to buy ONE thing and walk out with a $300 credit card bill. Yes we do pay the fee annually to shop here for some things that we can't get at the local supermarket, mostly because we use a LOT of something. But we juste seem to pick up too many items that wind up going stale or that we really didn't need so much of because most everything is mega sized. Twice we've bought food that has been recalled for some nasty reason, usually finding out about it after we've ingested it, so stay away from the samples if you value your health. It appears that people come here to eat for free, which I find very funny especially when I see the same people return again and again to the same line. They rarely carry anything gluten free and vegetarian and nothing is marked to the effect. They only accept one credit card, which is a huge inconvenience. That being said, on a rainy or cold weekend, when we have absolutely nothing better to do, we go there just to kill time and people-watch.

Costco Wholesale,Not as good on price as it was.,"I have been a member of my local Costco since it opened many years ago and I have been a regular customer and a huge fan. Two years ago I would have given them 5 stars without hesitation. Recently however I have found their pricing much less competitive, so much so I am beginning to question if my membership is value for money.for example:Books are cheaper on Amazon (with free delivery)Cameras are cheaper in PC world and ArgosPCs are cheaper in PC WorldMany foods are cheaper in Asda.Many white goods are cheaper on line without the hassle of arranging your own delivery, installation and disposal.Once you could almost take it for granted that if it was for sale in Costco then you were getting the best price. Sadly this is no longer true.Costco's buyers need a wake up call. It is all to easy for consumers to find the best price available . It seems that they Costco are just too slow to react to price fluctuations in the current fiercely competitive retail environment and if they carry on they will lose out on membership.",0,3
