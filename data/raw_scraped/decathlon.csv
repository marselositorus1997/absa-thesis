Decathlon DE,No customer service whatsoever,"I bought an elops 520 bycicle 1,5 years ago. The quality was not very good. There was included on the first year a 'revision' for free. There was where the bad customer service started. I gave the bycicle. After round 1 week, I asked the status. Then they said they would need to replace some parts. I said that was ok, I would pay for it. Waited, and after 1 month the bike was ready. However, nothing had been changed. Additionally, the bike could not even ride. In 1 second I could see there was something wrong. I complained, and the brakes were adjusted a bit at the time, making the wheel able to spin again. I took the bike home and improved the brake regulation myself. A little weird that the professionals could not do it in 1 month.Fast forward a bit. I repaired everything myself on the bike recently. The rear brake, however, is completely broken. For some reason, no one knows where can I find the fitting brake. I already asked a question in the question & answers section in the website. I already wen to the store and asked to the people working on the bike section. I already gave a review on the bicycle with the question. No one can tell me where to find the proper brake for the rear wheel. ( It is an inverted brake, regular V brakes from shimano do not fit). So here I am with a 1.5 years bike without a rear brake because Decathlon sells the bike but does not sell an essential part of it.",0,1
Decathlon DE,Poor customer service and un trustworthy products,Be very careful to keep receipt even for a cheap plus products because they‚Äôre cheap for a reason. I bought a headlamp it stopped working after one use and they wouldn‚Äôt replace it even though it was a Faulty product,0,1
