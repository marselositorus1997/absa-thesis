Euronics,Hoover Dishwasher from the Blackburn Store,I ordered a Hoover Dishwasher from the Blackburn store which came within the timescale quoted. All this was arranged over the phone with no issues what so ever. We opted for the extras to remove the old dishwasher and fit the new dishwasher as the prices to do this were very competitive ( Much cheaper than some of the other larger electrical stores ) There were a few complications arising from the previous kitchen fitters leaving a much larger gap than was necessary. However the chaps from Euronics persevered and we now have a beautifully fitted and fully working dishwasher. The whole experience has been an excellent one and we will be using their services in the future.,0,5

Euronics,Euronics Registering New Products For Extra Warranty,"Registering New ProductsI have been trying to register my new freezer for the extended warranty as advertised when purchased. I contacted Lec and the product was registered for the 1st year under the manufacturer’s warranty, but they would not extend the warranty by a further 2 years as this was not done through Lec.They supplied a number to contact UK Warranty which we used, the message give was to “leave your contact details and we will get back to you”, we rang on at least 6 occasions and also emailed this company twice but had no reply to any of these contact details.I have finally made contacted UK Warranty to be told that they cannot register my appliance because it is over 30 day since the purchase, I explained that this was not my fault as I was not contacted by them as stated in their voicemail, I then told me that she would check the phone calls to see if I had rang and if I had emailed.Guess what No Reply.I have also emailed Euronics on 2 occasions also with no reply.If you are purchasing items from Euronics you may want to consider this post.Purchased the freezer on 19.11.20 and still waiting to be contacted 24.01.21.Not the best service.",0,2

Euronics,Do not buy from Euronics,"Do not buy from Euronics, there is no after sales service, they just fob you off and tell you to contact the manufacturer who directs you straight back to Euronics. I have had Neff double eye-level ovens for 22 years and recently needed a replacement. I identified one that said that it had CircoTherm that cooks by re-circulating the air to give even cooking. This sounded like a good idea but once installed I realised it was a mistake! There is a vent above each oven door that blasts you with hot air if you stand in front of it, heating up the kitchen which is not something I want during a hot summer! It cooks evenly but doesn't give that golden appearance on top of most dishes. Other problems are the extremely quiet timer that was mentioned in reviews but I didn't believe that it would actually be that quiet, it beeps faintly for about 5 seconds so cannot be heard from another room or when distracted. My previous oven had a really good timer that beeped for at least 20 seconds and was loud enough to be heard in the lounge with the door closed. The control knobs are cheap plastic and poor quality. I wrote to the head of customer services at Euronics and sent my letter with 'signed for' delivery. Two days later I received a reply to say that as the oven had been fitted there was nothing they could do and that I needed to have checked these things out before making the purchase. Now, how is this possible when viewing anything at the moment is almost impossible and the only companies with showrooms have no stock! We are all having to shop online which is no substitute for seeing the item in a store. I can't see how I could identify that there would be hot air blowing out of the oven when in use without it being fitted and it certainly wasn't mentioned in any of the descriptions of the appliance. How would I be able to hear the timer unless someone could demonstrate it, and the guy who fitted it didn't, I guess because he knew how bad it was!? The reply I received from Euronics didn't even address the problems or give any advice, I'm sure they know how disappointed customers are with this model. I will be pursuing this complaint with Euronics but also Neff who need to know how bad Euronics are as a supplier.",0,1

Euronics,Don’t buy anything from these cowboys,"Don’t buy anything from these cowboys. They solder me a TV with DVD package, however DVD player was not compatible with TV. I went to a local electronics store for advice, Euronics recommended I buy a converter to resolve this. Local electronics advised this was utter nonsense and advised I buy a compatible DVD Player which I have. All working fine, I contacted customer care to return original DVD player, that was weeks ago. I was sent a returns form and sent DVD player back at my own expense. An Post confirmed delivery received by Euronics over two weeks ago. I still have no refund and customer care are now ignoring me so looks like I have lost over 50 euros. I have checked their returns policy which advises refund should be with me by now. Raising this again to Euronics but now they won’t correspond with me. Complete scam! Never, never buy anything, also Euronics in store refuse to help with any of their online deliveries. Customer Serivce is appalling!",0,1

Euronics,I wish I had posted this last year but…,I wish I had posted this last year but due to many unfortunate events this matter was not the forefront of my mind. I purchased a television from Hills Brighton. During the warranty period I called to report that the connection at the back of the TV in which to connect the sound bar was broken. A technician called and advised that this seemed to be a regular issue with this television and would report back. I was then contacted by the store to advise this was not covered as it was not a fault and that we had caused the issue. We had apparently pulled the cable out with force. I advised this was not the case and have many other Televisons within the household and have never had a problem with any of them. He stated it was seen regularly however by others whom also pull the cable out forcefully.

Euronics,Money for old rope!,Contacted them to inquire about replacing a heat pump/element on a dishwasher as indicated by the error code on the machine. Said they would come to investigate for a one-off call out charge plus any parts. The engineer came over and within 10 seconds suggested it wasn’t worth getting it fixed given it was a free standing machine...cost versus value of machine. They could have said that over the phone instead of wasting each other’s time and my money!Update reply: M.A. Wash Vac,0,1
Euronics,A SORRY TALE,"This review relates to Euronics Johns Electrical, Scunthorpe. I purchased a Samsung QLED television in November 2019 which developed a problem 11 days outside of the Samsung 28 day return policy. I contacted Johns whose initial response was contact Samsung nothing to do with us, I informed them I was not happy with this and mentioned the Consumer Rights Act 2015 which was ignored. A representative from Euronics contacted me and reiterated it was a Samsung guarantee issue and at my request took up the issue with Samsung. After several contacts between us the representative gave up with Samsung and asked I make direct contact, which I did. I am now at the stage of an ongoing official complaint against Samsung just to get an engineer out. So what’s to be learnt from my sorry tale, initially don’t buy any Samsung products as their guarantee is not worth the paper it’s written on and sadly don’t buy from Euronics.",0,1

Euronics,Excellent customer service and expert advice,"Excellent customer service from the moment I walked into the store up to and including delivery, installation and hauling away the old machine. Five stars. I went into Pounds, Green Lanes, London N21 2RS (part of the Euronics group) because I needed a new washing machine. The team could not have been more helpful.I had done some research online and had narrowed it down to two Bosch models to replace the existing Bosch washing machine. As I was looking at the two models on display, the manager asked how he could help; I explained what I was looking for and I was given expert advice about the functions and features of each model. It was then that my attention was drawn to a Siemens model, as this had all the features I was looking for and a 5 year guarantee (as opposed to the 2 year guarantee offered by Bosch). Bosch, Siemens and Neff are owned by the same company, and so have similar high quality and specifications. I chose the Siemens model and arranged for delivery and installation of the new machine and removal of the old machine - these services were free on a current offer!The delivery and installation team were knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. As the team were removing the old machine, I realised that the free-standing cupboards near the door to the utility room would not allow enough room for the washing machine (I should have thought of this earlier), but this was no trouble to the guys who moved the furniture for me and put it back afterwards without complaint. The old washing machine was removed and the new washing machine installed and tested. One very happy customer! Highly recommended.",0,5

Euronics,Not willing to price match on a display model,"I visited my local store in Sidcup and looking for a 24” TV. When they didn’t have what i was looking for, they offered me a 24” LG TV that they had on display. This was the only model they had left. I told the elderly gentlemen that it was more expensive than Amazon and its been on display and would he reduce the price. He said no this is the price and that’s it. I had been in the shop for nearly 30 minutes waiting to be served and asking questions. I didn’t like the customer service i received i actually thought he didn’t really want to sell me this TV. I eventually said i would order it from Amazon. I did in fact get the same TV from Currys and they price matched Amazons price. They lost a sale for the sake of 3 pounds and poor service",0,1

Euronics,Euronics Good.  Product Changes??,"My local dealer in Warwick is superb, however the apparent move by Euronics from Premium Brands like Bosch to brands like Blomberg concerns me. I recently purchased a Blomberg Freezer thinking it to be a similar brand to Bosch and have had to return it as the Thermostat was faulty. I had a Beko upright freezer until around a couple of years ago and disposed of it due to the difficulty in withdrawing and replacing drawers. This Blomberg is so similar in operation that I wonder if there is any connection. Badged Beko?",0,3

Euronics,TERRIBLE RUDE DISGRACEFUL SERVICE,"(This shop is also known as WOODALLS.)I wanted to buy a MIELE appliance and called the shop in Temple Fortune to find out about their stock situation for the machine I wanted. The rude so called assistant was dismissive and gave me short shift as though I had interrupted his day by giving him business. He couldn't wait to get me off the phone and his arrogant man told me he was “super busy”I bit the bullet and I decided to visit the store and the same man just shouted rudely from the back of the shop at me (some 50 feet away) and frankly, his manner was a disgrace. I told him I would rather stick needles in my eyes then give him my four figure sum of money and his response was “suit yourself”You have been warned.",0,1

He told me they weren't licenced to do this due to health & safety requirements, and I'd have to get the local council to do it. OK to transport and install but not remove?How strange! I went to another Euronics stockist in town and of course removal wasn't a problem. I don't know of any other outlet that doesn't offer removal/disposal of old appliances as part of their service. Others may have had a better experience with them but for me it was a disappointment.",0,1

Euronics,Buyer beware!,"Two days ago my 85 year-old mother called her local Electrical retailer (Brightmore, Burbage, Leics), a Euronics wholesaler, to sort out an issue with her TV. The attending technician informed my mother that the appliance was irreparable and would need replacing. My mother then asked the company to provide a suitable replacement, and although a replacement was indeed delivered the same day, suitable it was not. My mother does not have broadband and the original TV was a 39 inch non-SMART appliance that I had purchased for her. Moreover, the appliance WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. Yet Brightmore replaced it with a much smaller SMART TV. This morning I rang Brightmore in an attempt to resolve the issue. I was hoping that we would be able to retrieve the original TV and return the unnecessary replacement. Unfortunately, I was greeted on the 'phone with rudeness and hostility and a refusal to acknowledge my concerns over the matter. The individual also refused to give his name, giving additional insight into the Brightmore culture. In this matter the company's ethical practices were well below a level that should be deemed acceptable and I would advise anybody, especially the elderly, to think very carefully before dealing with it.UPDATE - I was surprised to receive your 29th January update but not as surprised as my mother who refutes any suggestion that the company has been in touch, even showing me her 'phone logs to . prove the point. Indeed, she is far from delighted with the service she received. If the company has informed you that all was well, then we should also add misrepresentation to the negatives previously reported.Steve Thompson",0,1

All of them failed to keep delivery promises. So after 2 weeks I popped into Euronics (JDR Thomas) in Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire. This is a great shop with excellent customer service. I went to the shop in the morning paid for the machine a Zanussi 9kg and by 2.30pm the same day it was fully installed.They even took all the packaging away with no charge - unlike the big name stores who charge for everything they can.

Couldn't deliver Sat morning nor Friday nor Monday. So I have to take ANOTHER day off work on Tuesday to meet delivery men.You can't get through to Euronics Customer Services phoneline.I only bought the washing machine from Euronics because it has a 3 year warranty, not sure how good this will be if you can't get hold of anyone by phone.

Euronics,Do not buy from euronics ever.,They are terrible. I bought a monitor for nearly 800 euros. It doesn't work and keeps shutting off 10-20 times a day. I found out that we can't return it because we opened the box and the only option was to send it away for a while to be repaired. This is terrible service because it means I will be without a monitor for potentially weeks. This results in lost revenue in business all because they won't refund us for a faulty monitor. Never buying from them again and I recommend to look somewhere else or BUY FROM AMAZON. Amazon's customer service is the best so I won't be buying from Euronics again.,0,1

Euronics,Not as Specified,"I had to replace a large fridge-freezer and was advised by Euronics, Chesham, to instead buy a matching pair of Liebherr. Although rather more than I had anticipated spending, this seemed sensible if better quality meant better long term value. The price appeared reasonable and they promised prompt delivery so I agreed, making it abundantly clear that a matching pair was what I was after. As I could see in the catalogue, effectively two large, white boxes with door handles. They even had the freezer in stock and would charge a competitive amount to remove and dispose of my old fridge freezer. The freezer could be delivered the next day but the fridge would take a few days, which was acceptable. I wanted to support my local independent retailer, so I placed the order for both items on the same day for the asking price. When the fridge was unpacked in my kitchen a few days after the freezer, it was obvious that while both items were indeed large white boxes with door handles, the shapes of the doors were quite different. The handles were not even a close match. Their delivery man rang the shop to ask what to do. I heard the reply, which was effectively “lump it” - you ordered them after seeing the catalogue.I am now the extremely dissatisfied owner of two large, expensive, not even slightly matching kitchen appliances. Next time I need to buy any items, I will not bother to think about helping local businesses and just buy the cheapest rubbish from whichever offshore-based on-line portal has the lowest price for it. If all the local stores go out of business it is no great loss since they don’t offer the two things which we value above all else. Service and trust.",0,2
Euronics,Avoid rip off merchants don't repair or replace,"Bought an item for £250 from cradley store and one week over a year later it broke. I went in the store to be told it's nothing to do with them (which it is because they're who I bought it from). I was told I'd have to pay to get repaired and the woman laughed at my suggestion of a replacement and just gave me the number for Beko. Fortunately for me Beko have promised to repair or replace in the next couple of weeks, shame as it's 20 degrees plus outside and really need a fridge, plus I shouldn't of even had to make the many calls to beko, they should of did it, that's why I paid them £250 in the first place, otherwise I could of probably ordered direct from Beko and saved money and time. Very unprofessional considering how much things are in there I've had better service in so called smaller shops and the products have lasted much longer. Save your money and time and look elsewhere because when your really expensive appliance breaks down they'll basically laugh you out the door. They don't think it's unreasonable that an item from their shop breaks down in just over 12 months. Thanks.",0,1

Had stock of the TV i was looking for (was sold out everywhere) Paul came out the same day to check if the wall was secure enough for installation. Received a quote immediately which i was happy with and the TV was installed 2 weeks before they had originally stated!On the day of installation Paul and Derek came out and it was literally like having 2 friends over to help out installing the TV. Great fun, years of experience and individuals you can actually have a proper conversation with. Consummate professionals, great advice and even offered to take a look at my aerial which was causing us issues. If you're looking to be treated like family or a close friend look no further - absolutely brilliant from start to finish. Beats other faceless/soulless high street sales focused stores hands-down. Highly recommended and will definitely use their services again (try and get Paul and Derek for your TV needs) you wont be disappointed",0,5
Euronics,SHARP PRACTICE,Rang the Scunthorpe Euronics store to enquire if they had a TV in stock that I was trying to source locally. I was told it was in stock and that I could have it that day so I called in later to buy it. I explained to the salesman that I had rang earlier and asked for the TV. He asked for payment so I paid. He then told me that he needed to arrange for someone to get it. I asked if it was in their other store(Johns Bargains) nearby and offered to go for it. He said no that it needed to be set up here. Although puzzled by this and beginning to feel a bit suspicious I left it at that and waited while he made a couple of phone calls. A guy duly arrived empty handed and after speaking with the salesman went into another room and emerged with an empty box then started to remove the stickers from a TV that was on display and switched on! I said to the salesman that I didn’t know it was a display model I was getting and asked if it was customary to offer a discount on display models. He said it wasn’t and that the TV would last 5 or 10 years. By this point I felt I was being conned. I took my money back and left the shop saying that what he was doing was sharp practice. If he had said up front that it was a display model I might have agreed to it but the sneaky way he tried to slip one past me put paid to that. SNEAKY GUY! This took place on Thursday 07-03-2018,0,1

I returned a few days later to explain I no longer needed the hose kit and I wished to return the item. He informed me I would have to pay a 25% re stock charge to which I was albeit taken back. I explained to him I had not used it and would like the amount back what I paid for it. He turned his back to me on no more than three occasions, served another customer and answered the phone when he hadn’t finished with me. His whole attitude changed when I wanted to return my product which I had every right to do. I told him I would not accept this and would like a refund. I asked him to sho me the returns policy so I could identify what he was saying was true, he looked on the computer and told me it was actually 50% to which I then told him your kidding me, right? He told me no I am not I will offer you 10% then and that’s what I can do for you, I have more in stock than I need now. I explained to him that he has one in stock now he has ordered another so it was one extra. He eventually gave me a refund minus 10% and still have not received my refund.

Euronics,let me down,Like previous review i was let down by currys ! ive had problems with them before (see my review of currys ) so on the off chance i went into euronics for a tumble dryer . On entering the Newport store i was surprised to find such a wide range of goods on display and was served by a lovely friendly lady who sold me the exact dryer i wanted. will recommend this store and will most certainly be using again thanks UPDATE after my review i returned to euronics newport with my 80 year old mother to purchase a new oven ! was told this would take 3 working days ! however euronics kept us waiting for 10 working days and oven still didnt turn up > after several phone calls we were offered SLIGHTLY better oven that was in stock for the same price . The oven is now fitted and working but i feel let down that we went out of our way to purchase locally and were let down ! this is a shame as the staff did try to help us out . Will be trying ao .com in future which is a shame as i thought id found a good local shop in euronics .,0,5

Euronics,Incompetent Euronics Estonia,"I bought a MacBook at Euronics that broke down after three days.Although I especially signed up for a so called ""Gold Client"" insurance and the shop clerk acknowledged that the machine was broken (in a written form) I did not get a new computer. After three days I called the customer service and they told me that they still transport the computer from the shop to the repair (both in the same town, Tallinn). Two more calls and several e-mails to the client service and empty promises that everything will be fixed later I still do not have any information when and if I will get a new computer.My simple advice: Do not sign up for the ""Gold Service"" it is useless. Do not buy a computer at Euronics",0,1
Euronics,Excellent,"First time user of this company. Moston Manchester store was great , ordering my gas cooker for next day. He gave me a number for my local gas fitter, who came to plumb in the cooker after it was delivered. The gas fitter when to the trouble of explaining the use of my new cooker",0,5
Euronics,"promised much, delivered little...","used Euronics Newport because of its connection to AF Thomas, which used to be a great shop, and because we try to shop local when we can, rather than go to the internet. Won't be using them again though. Bought a microwave and a fridge freezer. Freezer arrived damaged (dented door) AND with an additional £15 delivery fee that we hadn't been warned about when we purchased. This was in addition to the £20 fee we'd already paid. Just me and my elderly mother in the house, NO WAY would we have bought a fridge freezer on the understanding that I'd be 'unpacking it and installing it myself'. Her kitchen is open plan and leads from the hallway so 'delivery and installation' into the kitchen actually meant moving it another couple of feet down the hall. Very misleading sales information. We were promised early delivery, as I was due to travel back home by train later that morning, but though it was before 10am, it wasn't 'very early' at all. Stressful, awkward, uncomfortable having to argue with delivery guys and ring the shop while they waited around wasting their time and mine. Won't trust this company again, it'll be Argos or AO for the next purchase, I'm afraid.",0,2
Euronics,Adding £200 onto average appliances when using family fund!,"So, I received a grant for a washer dryer from family fund of £600 and looked on the euronics website just browsing before I made my decision.. I then typed my code in to find out that all the washer dryers had gone up £200 in price?? I ordered a washer dryer that was £580 which was actually £350.. i know it's charity but it's ripping off families with disabled children.. we need the best equipment when it comes to these things as they tend to get used a hell of a lot.. so disappointed in this.",0,1
Euronics,repair to washing machine,"I'm absolutely disgusted at the way I was treated when I rang to arrange a call out for an engineer to repair my machine .I was fortunate to be awarded a grant to purchase one from Family Fund as I have a disabled child . and rely on a daily basis to do several loads of washing .I wastold this would take up to 3 working days, after several expensive phone calls as I was left on hold for over 10 mins on one occasion I rang a total of 20 times and wasn't even answered that day at all. eventually I spoke to an adviser who was extremely rude and showed no empathy at all at the fact I had to take my clothes to the laundrette on 8 consecutive days .not only was it expensive but stressful. I cannot believe I had to write several emails to UK WARRANTY who took days to even respond to 3 of them I was absolutely furious .no one wanted to acknowledge any blame or fault for causing me to be left that long without a working machine or the effect it had... horrid experience I hope no other customer will have to go through ... very disappointed with the outcome",0,1
Euronics,Taking your money is the only efficient thing they will do,"Short review: absolutely avoidExperience: Booked fridge repair, based on shiny website that also said for a fee, they would also responsibly recycle if they couldn't fix it.Man showed up (incidentally, they said that a call of 30 mins notice would take place, didn't happen - he had copied my down wrong - no apologies). He had idea what problem was, and quickly wrote out bill. As made explicit at time of booking, this is a 3 way fridge: runs off mains, gas and electric. Bog standard for boats and caravans - the model number was included in original enquiry so it can’t have been a surprise, they also knew it was on a boat. The fridge was not running off gas, there was no pilot light and I turned the gas off, and demonstrated doing so.Because the ""engineer"" (what a misleading word) didn't know why the fridge wasn't working he said he would need to come back. I stupidly paid – big mistake. Obviously, they washed their hands when after almost two weeks of chasing I finally got a reply. They spend a lot of resources deflecting customer reviews, so they will likely reply to this and say something like they are not gas engineers, why then, did they accept the booking? They knew the model of the fridge and that it was on a boat, so much for their web-site stated ""technical know-how"" and ""years of experience"".I suffer from British-ness: I never wish to make a fuss, so I politely asked for their complaints procedure to escalate - no reply. They did not supply anything near a service, I still don't know what's wrong with the fridge: just that they won't fix it, won't quote, won't come back and won't remove it. I would have been content enough with a partial refund, just even £20 or £30 in a nod to customer service but it was laughed off.What they can do with utter efficiency is take your £90 - I hope they enjoy the lucrative returns their shoddy business gives them. What a miserable way to make a living, who'd want to be these people?",0,1
Euronics,Ace Domestics Customer Review,"Had a flooded kitchen recently and called in to book a repair on our LG washing machine. Within half an hour you were on our doorstep and diagnosed a hole in the drum caused by a faulty heating element. The machine was just over two and a half years old and a cause for concern. After having made several calls to LG it was decided that they should organise an engineer to come and assess the cause. About an hour or so later you rang us to say that you would bring a new replacement machine and take away the faulty one, this was very good of you as the warranty had run out. We are so grateful to you, and cannot thank you enough for the fantastic service you have given us. We have no hesitation in recommending you, Ace Domestics are at the top of the list. Again many thanks.",0,5
Euronics,Disgusting service,Had a cooker in 2014 through the family fund as I have 2 disabled children 16 months later the cooker broke the fan was replaced 2 months further down the line the conductor box blew at the back off the cooker 4 weeks ago still no repair engineer came out 2 weeks ago was supposed to come back last week with part phoned to say part hadn't come in week later still no contact had a guts full hope family fund decide to use someone else from now on especially when one child needs a special diet that I can't cater for due to this joke of a company no answer on their helpline the cooker cost 600 pound with extended warrenty what a rip off,0,1
Euronics,Shockingly bad experience.. Won't be using again!!!!!!!!,"Bought a Blomberg dryer from Euronics through family fund and paid extra so we could have a dryer that suited our large family. first one delivered had a huge dint on the side so sent back and new one ordered. ""New"" dryer arrives wrapped in the old packaging which is the same broken one(we took a picture of the serial number which were the same) but now doesn't spin.. Sent back again and new one delivered. Guess what this one is also damaged so sent back again have waited 3 WEEKS with no dryer and a very young family! Spoke to Euronics customer service who say THEY WILL DO NOTHING TO COMPENSATE OUR WASTED TIME AND INCONVIENCE just simply send us ANOTHER ""NEW"" dryer... Really shocked by their bad customer service and unwillingness to accept responsibility for our terrible experience and inconvenience. We were told TO ASK FAMILY FUND TO COMPENSATE US AS EURONICS WONT... FAMILY FUND IS A CHARITY FOR DISABLED CHILDREN WHY WOULD YOU SAY ASK THEM TO COMPENSATE YOUR MESS UP!!!!! DISGUSTING",0,1
Euronics,Ver bad company,Brentwood store has got very poor sales people. I went there twice with cash trying to purchase a tv but didn't as I was disgusted with their service especially to people of colour. I decided to order online. But after odering I had a feeling that I orderd a wrong model. I called the local store which was supposed to deliver the item just to ask if the model I had ordered was the right one with the features I was looking for. But was answered with this rude men who unpolitely told me tthat they don't deal with online purchases. I called again and was given a number to call which nobody answered. The item came and true to my feelings was the wrong item. I broke the seal just to check the item. They is no contact number on their website so I emailed then they replied with a contact number to call. I called and was shocked to be told that since I had broken the seal they were going to charge me 70 pounds plus 20 pounds to collect the item. I was gutted as this is not even mentioned in their return policy. I was so disappointed all I wanted to do was exchange and pay extra for the model I wanted. But after this I experience all I want is a refund minus 70 pounds they are charging it's disgusting. I will contact a lawyer about this because I feel I've been ripped I should be able to return a product for free if I'm not happy wiith it. Since the item hasn't been collected yet they might be more charges to come will keep you posted.,0,1
Euronics,Disgusted with their customer service!,"Untrustworthy! We were unknowingly, sold a display product for full retail price!Went to pick up two items from local Rayleigh Tower store, as were in stock; only one item was there when I arrived. On second collection, second item was damaged, but had already had engineer booked. After install, realised product was not brand new. Approached store and they did not deny (after trying to ""itimidate"" missus) this was display item and i/we were aware of this. (Blatant lie) Everyone knows you get discount on display items.Will not be going back! Untrustworthy cowardly cowboys",0,1

Euronics,Pathetic service from euronics,I purchased 2 soap dispenser last December end 2014. In less than a year I have had 3 issues with the dispenser. Now when I'm just about to complete a yr the Euronics team has given me a 100% product payment clause for getting the replacement for a machine fault on one of the machines. I am cheated by the company as the machine has been giving issues ever since I bought. I don't recommend this to anyone.,0,1
Euronics,Good service from Hadleigh store.,"We have just taken delivery of a Blomberg F/freezer, model number KGM 9550P, bought from Tower Electronics in Hadleigh. We can only speak as we find. We visited on a Sunday & were served by 2 salesmen who knew their products & gave good advice. We decided on the Blomberg, being German & hopefully a better quality item, than the Indesit f/f we were dumping after just 15 months use. That's another painful story. We were informed that our F/freezer, would have been made in Turkey, thanks for the info. We were offered a delivery choice of Thurs, Fri, or Saturday that week. Luckily our choice was in stock. 2 polite & very helpful men, delivered our goods, damage free, i am pleased to say, well within the 3 hour delivery window we were given. Up & running our F/freezer is quiet & cold. Our only WARNING, the guarantee, yes is correct, 3 years parts & labour included in the price. However, what was mentioned in store, but not driven home properly, is that unless you take out the Blomberg insuranse, £4 per month for 20 months, you will be charged £110 per engineer call out !, i guess after the initial 12 month period. That could easily have been added onto the boast of the 3 year cover. A bit naughty, this hidden charge i feel. We have taken out the insurance & happy to do so, just feel it could have been made obvious sooner. We would still have bought the goods & not felt, like we were having the wool pulled over our eyes.",0,5
Euronics,Very bad service,Rang about our washer breaking Told an engineer would call us within 24hours Didn't so rang again and told to ring back at 5pm We did and were told that the department who deal with claim have gone home. Rang again now told they have no information about our warranty despite it not running out toll February 2017. Asked to speak to a supervisor and were told she was busy and they could not put me through. Rang again 30 minutes later and asked again for the supervisor who was now a he and again was too busy to take my call. Said I wanted to complain and suddenly get a call back from them to say they have an appointment for us but would be a week from now. Also said she new nothing about my previous call . Rang AGAIN to speak to a supervisor and mysteriously got the same woman who I had just spoken to Call staff gave false info twice and told me to ring back at a time she new no one would be able to take my call Also refused to pass me to a supervisor several times WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN,0,1

Euronics,Cleveleys - Poor service,Very poor service. I was told that the Sale of Goods Act doesn't apply to them as the washing machine they sold me was 'fit for purpose'. If a machine that has had it after 2.5 years is fit for purpose then I'm astounded. Sorry but you've lost all future custom from me - including the £500 I've just spent on a new machine.,0,1
Euronics,Euronics - housewives choice rushden store,"Very disappointed with this company. Customer service does not seem to be at the top of their priority list, if we treated our customers in the same way we would have no customers left! My grandparents purchased a brand new Beko oven from this store in November last year with their warranty being registered as the 5th of December. As most customers would when their oven developed a fault with the element (a loud bang and it stopped working altogether) they contacted the store they had purchased from, safe in the knowledge that the item was still covered under warranty. An engineer was sent out who confirmed there was indeed a fault and the element needed to be replaced. Unfortunately he didn't have the element on his van and advised he would have to come back. This sadly left my grandparents without a working oven for over a week, but this turned out to be the least of the problems. When the engineer did finally return to fix the oven, when it was time to leave my grandparents were shocked to say the least when he turned around and asked for £68 - £28 for the part and £40 for twenty minutes labour. My grandmother attempted to explain to the man that the machine was still under warranty who's response was that they should have contacted Beko and the fee had to paid. My grandparents who are in their late seventies were understandably confused by this but never the less parted with the cash. They have since spoken to beko who have advised that now the work has been done there is nothing that they can do. Upon hearing from my grandparents what has happened it is safe to say that I am appalled and quite frankly disgusted with the level of customer service that has been offered. Working for a small business myself as an operations manager I know how important it is to treat your customers properly and offer a high level of customer service, including informing the customer of procedures, and liaising with the manufacturer. Not once were my grandparents told that they needed to contact the manufacturer to arrange the work or this would be charged, nor was the work quoted for before it was carried out. Holding detailed records of customer purchases is a very important part of business, with this in mind I am sure they would have been aware that my grandparents item was still under warranty and should have advised as such. If a customer of ours is still within warranty period not only do we know this but also arrange the replacement parts and or work to be carried out. Perhaps better to stick to reliable, reputable companies such as John Lewis who bend over backwards for their customers,rather than trusting a local store who's only priority is to make as much money out of their customers as possible. Clearly not interested in repeat business or business growth through word of mouth or recommendations. Have never heard of such a lack of customer service or helpfulness. If they were unwilling to honour the warranty and liaise with beko at the very least my grandparents should have been advised. But then housewives choice wouldn't have been able to get their hands on more of their money! Do not use this store!",0,1
Euronics,"Euronics - The Gas Centre, Hinckley, UK","I placed my order via the Euronics website on a Friday evening after being disappointed by John Lewis as they had sold out of the model I wanted. The following Saturday morning at 0915, I received a call from Nick at The Gas Centre in Hinckley confirming my online order and delivery date. I was impressed by the efficiency of his response, but there's more to come! I received a text the day before delivery advising a delivery slot between 12 - 3pm. I was happy with that, and then young Lewis arrived with my washing machine at 1.20pm - perfect! Lewis confirmed he was delivering the washing machine, fitting and removal of old machine. So he asked where the old machine was, as he said it should have been outside the house! I panicked and said sorry, I didn't realise (I had missed this on the website). Lewis kindly said he would remove it from the kitchen, and didn't complain at all. He did an excellent job of fitting the machine, removing the old one and all the packaging. Really, really happy with the service and would definitely use Euronics again!!!",0,5
Euronics,Avoid Hadleigh store like the plague!!,"They sold me a Bosch diswhasher which turned out to be defective. Delivered on Sat, started leaking from the bottom the same day. They forced me to wait for a Bosch engineer who called today (Tuesday) and confirmed the machine is defective - among other things it is leaking from the bottom, which means I had to cut the water supply off, which because of the way the plumbing is in my kichen means cutting off not only the dishwasher but also the washing machine and the sink!!The Bosch engineer was horrified by what he saw and immediately issued a return code, but was the problem finally solved? No, because Euronics - or rather, Tower Radio Ltd are so greedy that they want to fob me off with an ex-display machine when I have paid for a brand new one!!My advice to you: AVOID THESE GREEDY COWBOYS AND USE A PROPER RETAILER.Now I will have to pursue the matter through my credit card company and Trading Standards.

We were to call up the shop on the Saturday morning around 9 to get a delivery time. We were up at 6.30am as we had a BT engineer coming between 8-1 and then at 9.15am we got a call to say that they couldn't deliver as they didn't have any in stock. It really was so disappointing to think that two large companies had now let us down,. So we called ao.com that afternoon who promptly delivered what we wanted the next morning.

Good advice on the model, ordered it at 1.30pm and they delivered it one hour later. Can't ask for better than that and it was nice to use an independent rather than the big chain stores as I felt more of a valued customer than I do in somewhere like Currys.",0,5

Granted the shop was small, so only had a few on display but they could soon get me pretty well any model I wanted.What a stark contrast to my last visit to a well know nationwide chain.
