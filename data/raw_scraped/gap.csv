Gap,Failing on so many levels....,"Dear Gap, when you send a customer the wrong item then YOU should correct it, not leave it to the paying customer to go and do your bidding while standing in line at the post office or store to return your mistake before you will even send the correct item. Send a return label with the correct item and make it easy on the customer. The shipping label doesn’t even have the correct item on it. I’m too exhausted to call your customer service back and explain to them how your trading has failed them that I will simply be disputing the charges. If people are ordering online it is because they don’t have time to stand in line for you, or shop at the store. This is not genius but you do need some genius because from reading the other reviews it is obvious that whom ever is in charge of your customer service practices should be fired. A long going issue at this point.... while others are catering to online services during COVID Gap remains stagnant and ignorant of good service and reputation.",0,1
Gap,I have had it with Gap,"I have had it with Gap. As a single mother of 4, I shop a lot at The Gap. With my last purchase 3 tops that I purchased for $19.99 each, before using my rewards, arrived with sale prices, two for $14.99 and one for $5.99, a difference of $24.00. I called them and a supervisor said there was nothing they could due because I used my rewards...really, they just stole $24.00 of my rewards!",0,1
Gap,Bad customer service,"I purchased an item from GAP that had an additional 10% off promotion. I clicked the 'Tap to apply' and after the purchase was completed, I realized the extra 10% didn't come off the purchase price. I called customer service and the woman adjusted the purchase price. The item has since gone on sale, so I called to get price adjustment and told I couldn't because one was already applied. I explained it wasn't a fault of mine, but the systems and really wasn't a price adjustment at all. Still, customer service refused and said she would have the manager look it over. I haven't heard anything back. Being penalized because the companies system was working properly is just ridiculous.",0,1

Gap,"Fraudulent Advertising, Unprofessional Supervisor","First of all, RAY, a supposed supervisor, definitely needs training in how to deflate an upset customer. I buy a lot of merchandise from GAP, and every order, there's an issue! I only continue to shop there because my grandchildren love the clothes, however, their customer service doesn't exist. They advertise promotions you cannot use, they don't ship all your items, and you have to research what happened to them, they don't notify you. They offer absolutely no resolution to help. Shop at GAP at your own risk!",0,1
Gap,Amazon > Gap,"Why display something that supposed to be in stock, but really isn’t? I placed an order, only to be emailed a WEEK later that one of the items was cancelled because they were out of stock??? What the actual f***, Gap? I’ve never had this kind of problem with Amazon! Also what’s with shipping items separately? Why not ship everything altogether? I knew I should’ve shopped for baby clothes in person. Gap is overrated and they don’t even have that great selection of clothes. I have got to stop trying to impress mommy, eh?Amazon has way better baby clothes than Gap. They also have way better customer service (that isn’t saying much though) and they give people their refunds on time (usually). Despite the issues I have with Amazon, they’re a hell of a lot better than Gap. I better get my f****** money back you stupid motherf***ers.I should’ve ran straight to TrustPilot before trusting what my mother suggested. I should’ve read these reviews. Lesson learned - NEVER AGAIN.I wish they would go bankrupt, but the mentally ill Kanye West is collaborating with Gap. They’ll never get their comeuppance.",0,1

Gap,DO NOT order from GAP until LASER SHIP is OUT…,"this is the first time i have ever written a review. The shipping service used by Gap- LaserShip is so horrendous i feel i should warn everyone. DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER WITH GAP UNTIL LASER SHIP IS FIRED. All UPS shipments over the past several years have arrived with no issues and on time. GAP is using a new shipping company called LASER SHIP- i am now on my third day on the phone, and 5 hours into holding for GAP customer service and Laser ship has a 30 minute hold time then the agents have no ability to help--",0,1

They forgot to enter my apt # and this is the second time it has happened. Now I have to call shipping to track down the order and update my address? I don’t think so! I’ll be calling customer service to vent tomorrow! How do they expect to stay in business and compete with companies like Amazon is beyond me! I’d love to support small businesses and other businesses that serve middle class customers, but they need to fix their internal issues or they’ll go extinct!",0,1

Gap,Unprofessional Customer Service,"First of all, I have difficulty logging in even with the new password I just made. So, I had to call the customer service. The customer service was so unprofessional that it is beyond one could imagine! First of all, the first customer service representative just transferred me to another without forwarding any information so I had to explain one more time what happened. Then the second representative sounded so impatient as if he was doing me a big favor by repeating the website one more time! The conclusion is if you want to make a timely payment online, guess what, that purchase you made hasn't even been posted online! Okay, it's your fault by being ahead of them!",0,2
Gap,Hopping on the 'poor quality' band…,"Hopping on the 'poor quality' band wagon. I've been buying my jeans exclusively from GAP since high school. They fit the way I liked, consistent, and held up well for how frequently I wore them. NOW: All jeans are the lame stretch denim, color fades fast and the two of the three pairs that I've owned just barely over a year have random holes popping up all over. Down by the leg, under the knee??!!, by the belt line. Pitiful. Sad, but I have no choice but to find another place to shop. By GAP RIP.",0,1

Gap,The poor quality of GAP’s jeans,The quality of GAP’s jeans has plummeted. It’s falling victim to the age of abundance low quality disposable clothes that only for a few months. In the last 12 months I have bought 3 jeans all of which ended up with material giving way in the crotch and bump area. Ironically I have GAP jeans bought 5 years ago that I still use frequently. Age of fast fashion and wastefulness.,0,1
Gap,Customer Service is very very bad,"Customer Service is very very badCustomer Service is very very bad. I mean worst.They cancelled my order with no notification( wow great) They said that my CC isn’t verified whatsoever. Which I already instated to them all the details they needed which is correct. (FYI) I’m super nice while talking to her( working for many years in customer service industry. I know the stress handling guest) but wow. This is a next level. 1st. Agent ask the email and give it and she couldn’t find it. I ask her can’t you find under my name or my phone number she said she can’t.till ending up asking my home address( great that’s super weird) ow well end up not resolving the problem( take note! Super awesomely rude( don’t want to deal with it and say bye and hang up. I called the 2nd time (coz I bought gazillion of clothes for my husband) well the gentleman helped me thou and look up my order under the phone number that I am using without even giving my full name, address or some personal details( blows my brain out coz the First Lady can’t find it and boom the gentlemen just saw my order, just like a blink) he said that before cancelling the order they will call me or notify me which they never do at the first place!)( well I’m trying to be cool and don’t want to get mad coz I don’t want to waste my time( patience woooshhhh even my brain cells and my blood is moving to my mouth want to say something but trying to hold it) well he said that they’ll call my bank to verify it which I understand( that’s there SOP) which I do understand. Till he get back to me coz he is trying to call the bank) well he get back saying can’t reach the bank and call me back once they did( which they didn’t until office hours is done done) well, I ask him if I can just change my CC coz I don’t want to deal with it and just to get what I ordered for my husband.( well now my ending is empty handed).I’ll call tomorrow and say the word! No need. Never again! Will never order to them or go to the store!( my patience is gone!!!!) CUSTOMER SERVICE IS about helping the customer, figure out things, give them options, cooperate and talk to them, build a friendly connection. Working as a customer service agent is pretty hard. I know you guys stress. But if you guys work in the Customer Service industry. We have no choice(you accept that job),( when you guys are stress answering the phone it reflects that you are not happy with your job)We still need to smile and move on. The next time you answer the phone. Smile even the Customer/Guest can’t see you. It’s still reflects on our voice. Tell to your supervisor or manager your stress and move on. Don’t give it to your Guest. We get discouraged to order again. (Okay, going to different online store)POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Never anymore.",0,1

This has the post office do the final delivery - adding days to the delivery time. I called, asked for a manager, it took 3 try’s & I still got a supervisor. GAP doesn’t appear to have good control over their logistics. Apparently they do not have a clue. Very disappointed - no wonder their stock is going down down down.",0,1
Gap,Bad Business,"Ok, I realize we are in the middle of a pandemic but I ordered something on 11/30/20. Twenty nine days later and I still have not received. The tracking number shows no movement since 12/7/20. It is not that Gap is responsible for shippers but they are responsible for what method they selected. They must select parcel post because all other packages I ordered this year have arrived. When contacted they suggest you contact carrier. Why would you have a customer service if you can't help someone? I personally would not ship with any carrier that I could not track. This is ""BadBusiness"" and they have probably lost a lot of customers. If I could see a glimmer of hope the package will arrive I would not be writing this review.",0,1

Called Gap last week and was told I had to wait until 12/21 before they could do anything. Called today as items still had not arrived and they said they could issue me a return that would show up in 3-5 days and repurchase everything at my expense today. When speaking with a supervisor was told their company never reships items at no cost to customer. That no matter if items were damaged, missing, wrong item shipped, etc, that customer is always asked to repurchase the item(s) again as they wait for their return. Epitome of bad customer service and I will never purchase from this company again. Beware of this company.",0,1

Gap,"No Way to Get a Receipt, Bad Business Practices","I have found that this company is terrible when it comes to ordering clothing online from them or any of their affiliated stores. In my past few orders from Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic I have not been receiving an order confirmation email. When the order does finally arrive there is no sheet detailing the items that I ordered and no receipt in the box or package. When I go to the website to look up the order, the website always takes me to a page saying there is a ""Technical Difficulty."" When I call customer service the people there say they can see my order, but there IS NO WAY to send me a receipt. This is ridiculous and its just bad business practices to not send or keep records of the purchases to your customers.

Gap,Gap online orders and customer service…,Gap online orders and customer service is the worst. They do not give you the Gap Cash$ and GapReward$ you are entitled to. They try to charge for shipping even if you qualify for free shipping. They scam you with online orders. They don’t allow you to cancel an order immediately after placing order. Customer service is the worst. It is out sourced to other countries and the communication is not understandable. It’s no wonder the stores are closing. Shipping is always longer than 10 days even if you pay extra to expedite. This is a terrible place to shop.,0,1

My account was overcharged, gift card not applied, and these morons, (supervisors and customer resolution) sent me to my bank and gave me an email at Gap which sent me back to where I started. Morons. No one knew what the hell they were doing but their logic was that their computer screen shows the correct amount owed so don't worry about it. Huh? I am being overcharged given the receipt you sent me but I was not entitled a corrected receipt? U kidding me? Shove your 20% off coupon for my difficulty. NEVER AGAIN!!!",0,1

Gap,Online Orders,I phoned customer service minutes after placing and order due to issues with the billing information and was advised by customer service that my order probably wouldn't be processed due to entering the receiver information as my billing information due to that issue a request to cancel the original order was placed and a new order was originated instead of receiving and email advising me of the cancellation I was advised the orginal order had been sent out for delivery. I'm now paying for two of the exact same orders and the inconvenience of driving 45 minutes from my home to retrieve the additional order that needs to be returned which could have been avoided if the company just offered a convenient resolution for canceling orders.,0,1
Gap,Worst Customer Service.,Worst Customer Service.They don't even respond to emails sent 2 months ago.I have placed an order 5 days back and now the prices dropped for items I purchased with an additional 10% off.I purchased using $200 rewards and paid $4 using Gap Credit card.I called in today spoke with an associate for Priced Adjustment and she said she cannot do it. I asked for the manager and manager Anita also refused Priced Adjustment saying price adjustment cannot be done on orders using rewards.I did tell her this not my experience earlier and price was adjusted and gap team issued a code for further purchases.

Needless to say, this was a frustrating example of UPS incompetence.However, I called GAP customer service and spoke with Gracie on 10-22-20 who fixed everything perfectly. She immediately understood the problem and proceeded to repurchase and ship the shirts at an even better discount than I had before while processing the return for the bungled shipment. Honestly, this was probably the most competent and enjoyable customer service experience I've ever had with a business, especially when the issue wasn't even GAP's fault.

They said, let's wait until the end of October to see if the bra is returned in the mail. Meanwhile, I have no bra and no money. The least Gap could do is recognize that we are in usual circumstances (and that the post office is in collapse right now), take customers' word about returns, and return our money. It is not acceptable to wait two months for my money back. Furthermore, each time I call Gap to try to solve the issue by phone, I am put on hold and the entire phone call sometimes lasts over half an hour. The people on the phone are friendly, but that doesn't solve any of the above issues.",0,1

(Removed way later.) We went to a Gap store, and got the 3 xs bras, trying them on, and seeing the the xs were the right size and the small were to big, so we wanted to cancel the 3 small that we ordered. Then, we spent over an hour on hold, and trying to get connected to a chat to try and cancel the order. We even sent emails. We never did get connected. We figured we'd refuse the package when it came, but it was delivered to the wrong address, and the only address on the package was the road name. Nothing else. Upon finally getting the package from the person it was delivered to, one of the items was a white cami, not even a freaking bra.

Still haven't received my other 2 items. Sat on hold FOREVER listening to horrible rap music and eventually hung up after 45 minutes. Sent an email, got a ""robo reply"" that they were unable to respond due to unusually high call volume. No wonder they have a high call volume. They are rip off artists!",0,1

Gap,Try the chat feature,"I gave a horrible one-star rating but am going to have to retract that and give a rightfully earned new perfect rating. I went to try the chat feature today (July 31, 2020) since I have a sore throat and didn't want to make a phone call. I was emailing senseless until Shikyesha today sorted out the mess and gave me the refund I spent weeks requesting. If customer service is failing you right now, I advise giving the chat feature a try. It's much more convenient and saves more time than a phone call and it gets the job done. Thanks again for the quality customer service, Shikyesha!",0,5

Gap,This is the worst customer service and…,"This is the worst customer service and clothing store I have ever had. First, I ordered $ 300 worth of clothes and 75% of them were canceled due to a backorder which was not showing on their website when I ordered . No one also contacted me to let me know that almost my entire order was canceled. Adding to that the refund was wrong, I had to contact them to get the correct amount for the refund.Also, my order took 2 MONTHS to get here. After 5 emails I sent them asking for a prepaid shipping label because the website wouldn't allow me to print one for some unknown reason, I got an automatic email saying they don't could not help me with my request due to high call volume.So at the end of the day 75% of my order was canceled and what I received that didn't match correctly I'm not getting a refund because they are too busy.This is by far the worst customer service ever.

This is ridiculous. I have never seen a company struggle more than this one. This is so bizarre that I almost feel like I'm dealing with a scam artist. Will I ever receive my order? At this point, I think that won't happen. If someone could get a hold of me I will gladly change my review and mind but for the mean time, do not waste your money on this company. They will gladly take your money, not send you your order, and then won't let you be able to contact them.

I attempted to cancel that item. To date, I have yet to be able to accomplish this. You cannot do this on line. I’ve spent well over an hour on hold on the phone waiting for a customer service rep.

I’ve sent 5 emails and I still get no replies. I tried using the chat service. But the agent told me it’s only in the US. They should implement that in Canada since the chat service is faster. Later that day, I got an email saying my item has shipped and I don’t want it anymore because Gap has wasted my time. The item will remind me how terrible the customer service is... Yes, we’re in a pandemic, just be honest and say you can’t offer customer service right now. You should offer a button so we can cancel our own order for a limited time. 0 stars for gap",0,1

They are summer shoes, and by she maybe gets them, it will be fall, and probably too small to wear! I got a email from Gap today telling me new possible shipping date, and if I want to cancel, call customer service!! I emailed back, but doubt I will hear back. I called my bank and tried disputing charges, but have to wait until they ship. For the rest of you reading this, and waiting for Gap to give you refuns, try calling your credit card number and disputing charges. I did it recently on another purchase, and it was quick, and company finally reached out to me. Its ridiculous the size of Gap, and all the other stores they own, can't do better even through this covid. They could be working from home. The shoes finally arrived this week (july 29).

Gap,Just Because You're Paranoid Doesn't Mean They Aren't After You.,"I always try to be fair and update or delete any bad reviews if things improve, which I did with Gap in July after a particularly harsh review. Well, not anymore. Not with Gap. Wish there was a minus star option... Suddenly they started cancelling all my orders automatically, each cancellation followed by an obscure email about ""security reasons"" and ""potential fraud"". The first time this happened was during their 50% off sale about 10 days ago, so I missed out on the item I wanted - my size ran out. Not wanting to waste money on a long international phone call I emailed customer service. But that's useless - you immediately get a reply stating that GAP don't reply to emails. Catch 22, only not funny. Somehow I managed to get them to offer me price adjustment if the item gets back in stock. It did. Now all I had to do was follow instructions - replace the order and reply to the price adjustment email. I did. Another cancellation, and no response to my email because Gap do not respond to emails... Ordered a 3rd time using a different credit card. Order cancelled. Still no response. Oh how I miss you, Yossarian...",0,1

But I guess it's not their fault, it's the courier company's fault.I love their selvedge line (the 100% cotton ones), I just hope they offer more cuts, colors, and even heavier weights on their denim. The rest of their selection are meh, you can get much better and even cheaper basics on other brands. Personally, I think gap should just focus on making casual workwear inspired clothes. Maybe some 5 pocket/chino style duck canvas pants, field jackets, anything selvedge, there is a gap in that area bec no company as large as GAP (as far as I know) offers those. Actual workwear brands have cuts for actual work and it just looks bad wearing casually so I doubt Gap will compete with them for some time.I would love to have access to 100% cotton heavyweight duck canvas apparel, heavy selvedge denim and everything heavy without having to resort ordering from abroad or online on small stores.",0,3

I was told they would put in a ""request to cancel"" as they are unable to actually cancel or change a shipping address even seconds after submission. Tried to chat the following day.

I will definitely not be placing any more orders with this company until the Covid-19 pandemic subsides because they are literally impossible to deal with. Horrible, horrible customer experience and zero customer service.",0,1
Gap,Inaccessible customer services,"Since Covid19, their customer service is so broken that it’s reli not accessible in any way and no one is responding any call or email or online chat. Not to mention the shipping is super slow (much much slower than other similar brands) and the items arrived are totally different from what’s in the order! I ordered two GAP women clothes but received two Old Navy children clothes. They are truly broken....",0,1
Gap,I ordered some basics from the website…,"I ordered some basics from the website with a delivery window of about a week. The items did arrive on time, which is nice considering the circumstances these days, however one item was not included in the shipment. I contacted customer support but was given run around for quite some time before getting to someone with the ability to actually look at my order and figure out what happened. Though in the end, I did get the missing item delivered it took nearly 2 weeks and quite a bit of headache for something I could have easily purchased anywhere (and for a bit less, too).",0,3
Gap,Orders take forever to ship and are missing some items!,"Placed an order about three weeks ago, when I finally received it, it was missing several items.

Gap,Very similar situation as previous…,"Very similar situation as previous posts. Received an email stating order hasn't shipped yet, it has been over 3 weeks. Have been sitting on hold for an hour now, still waiting to speak with anyone in customer service. Chat isn't available, email isn't available. I would think those options would be a lot quicker to work through than only accepting phone calls. I do not have high hopes that this will get resolved.",0,1
Gap,"Hold time, over 40 minutes","Worst experience ever. I have never shopped with them before and this is the first and definitely the last time I order from them. I placed an order on 4/27/2020 and I called the next day to cancel it mind you I had to wait about 45 minutes to actually speak to someone. I was thinking my order was canceled but no, I waited that long time just to surprisingly get charged for my items 3 weeks later. Yesterday (05/19/2020) I received an email that part of the order was delivered. How is it possible that they were not able to cancel it because it was already processed but yet it took nearly a month to fulfill my order? I called today (waited over an hour) to try and get a refund just so the representative to say there’s nothing she can do. Then one of the items that was missing said it’s being processed even though the rep told me it shows cancelled on her end but with this horrible experience I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up getting charged for the item as well and it’s going to be shipped out. Don’t even waste your time trying to call because you’ll just end up holding for no reason.",0,1

Gap,Not A Trustworthy Company,Really disappointed in this company. My package still has yet to arrive and it’s been weeks.

I called the company multiple times waited hours and then got hung up on. No response from customer service but the money had been taken out of my account and I never received what I paid for.

Gap,Disappointing!,I tried the Gap Worcester and was severely disappointed with the staff's behavior. They were busy trying to close down at 7:30 PM instead of actually helping customers to buy more.

Upon receiving this, I responded and asked why, and finally through several more emails found out they were available but the store was not able to express ship(2-3 day shipping). This is why the canceled my order. If the shipping is not available, why on earth are they offering it at all! What a joke! Now I still have a pending charge that hasn’t been canceled after 4 days and still need to find gifts for them. They’re only attempt to correct their mistake is to offer a 15% discount on a future order. It’s too late now for that...This is horrible customer service! What a waste of my time!

Gap,Worst online shopping website,"I have been a Silver Gap card member for over 20 years. I will never, ever shop with them again. This is the 21st century yet you are not able to change the ship to address if it accidentally shipped to the address you last used. A mere seconds after I placed the online order, I realized it was shipping to my sister's apt. I called customer service immediately but they told me they could not change the address!! I said are you kidding? this is beyond ridiculous. They said they could only cancel the order and then I would have to reorder everything. I said absolutely not. Then they had the audacity to tell me that one item could not be canceled; remember, this is a mere minute after I clicked place order. So now, one of my christmas gifts is shipping to my sister's apartment. I told them I would never shop with again and that I would cancel my credit card. They thought that sending me a 20% off coupon would mitigate the damages. What company in this day and age is unable to alter a shipping address from their end a mere minute after the order was placed????",0,1
Gap,poor returns policy.,My daughter had got some clothing for her birthday but didn’t fit. We do not stay 1hour from a gap so had to plan it to go. Unfortunately the staff said they couldn’t return items as they come from a gap outlet which is an additional hours drive again. Apparently it’s a total different company all together. 🤔🤔🤔 smelt jobby when member of staff was trying to convince me.Hope this helps save anybody else waist time and valuable money at this time of year.

Seems to be the reason the company is getting smaller in the UK,0,1
Gap,Full of rubbish Gap,Full of rubbish Gap. I ordered some goods from Gap in September they took money out from my account then they put money back. Now after three months they are writing that money will come out from my account within 2-5 working days. They never asked me if it's okay with me or if I have money now. As a good gesture they offer me 20% off for my next shopping stating that this offer it's very good 😄. Gap you can keep your 20% I don't need that.,0,1

I have not heard anything since, so have just called them to be told that it can take up to 3 weeks for the return to be processed!!!! They have no way of checking when the return is likely to be processed & 'do not have a phone number' to even ring the warehouse to see where the return is. So in total the whole return process can take a month!!I love GAP clothes for my kids, but WILL NOT be purchasing anymore items online.. there are companies in the UK a lot bigger than them that can process returns a lot quicker & will chase it up on your behalf.

Gap,Love them.,"Never had a problem either Instore or online. I grew up in North America where Gap was staple for school clothes and the quality held up — I’ve been buying their clothes for a good 30 years now. If you have an issue (I’ve had a couple of delayed returns), they get back to you within roughly 24 hours, and quite frankly, as far as customer service goes, that’s pretty great. I do wish we could get Old Navy in the UK, but at least I have the Gap, I guess!",0,5
Gap,Avoid buying at Gap. I have been conned by them. It could be you next.,"I can see that over 70% of the reviews are bad on Truspilot. This is not surprising as Gap have no respect for there loyal customers either. I have been buying Gap cloths for over 25 years now and recently bought three pairs of Pyjamas worth £44. Unfortunately due to defective materials the garments have shrunk despite following correct washing instructions. When I wrote an email to there CEO Mr. Peck firstly he does NOT believe in replying to customers directly, as he feels customers are not that important. This is a guy who is paid millions of dollars in salaries and bonus yet takes customers for granted. Eventually I got a reply from a disrespectful member of team who was only blowing Gaps trumpet in how good they are and asked me to take the clothes to a Gap store. Even though I had bought the garments online and supplied pictures which don’t lie I was basically told to get lost in the usual Gap language. I use to spend over £1000 per annum but for sake of £44 these amateurish organisations behaved in an abhorrent way despite supplying proof with pictures. I would never buy from these cowboys again. Beware as they DO NOT appreciate loyalty and should you experience any faults with your garments they will tell you to go for a ride. Avoid buying from them is the only way to hurt these cowboys in taking customers for a ride in this abhorrent way.",0,1

Gap,poor skinny jeans,I really do not like designer skinny jeans yes it’s expensive and yes it lasts long but it doesn’t come out nice they claim that the jeans are skinny but how can it be skinny at the thighs but when it gets to around my ankle area it’s all flailing and loose it really brings down the whole look of an outfit and I understand that other brands like Tommy Hilfiger are the same but it’s very disappointing hopefully they can improve this. However the customer service is on point and all the workers are very helpful and nice. I also hope they can explore a wider range of ages and maybe look at doing market research or maybe go on Pinterest and look at outfits that are ‘trendy’ for teens nowadays because as a teen myself I definitely know that we do like designer ‘trendy’ wear.,0,2
Gap,Ridiculous policy,"Gap forgot to give me a 30% discount. I took the jeans back with receipt, rather than put the difference back onto the card they expected me to buy the jeans again at £45 and wait for a refund. I am a loyal customer. I immediately kept my jeans with no discount and informed the assistant that I would not return to the store. The assistant was NOT rude. My complaint has nothing to do with rudeness. I will never shop there again!",0,1

Gap,Will never shop at gap ever again,"Place one order they sent me the wrong size so I returned it. A month later I’m still waiting for a refund! I must have rung gap up to 8 tones over the period of a month to get this sorted. In the meantime I was given a discount an had to reorder again even though I’d had no refund for the first order. I thought it was a joke when my second order arrived again in the wrong size. So I sent it back and for some reason it was refunded in a week. I had to then reorder another colour just to get a hoody in the right size but eventually after much messing around fone calls to customer services an trips to the post office to return I was happy I’d finally got the hoody in the right size. I spent the next two weeks chasing the refund for my first order I told customer services I was not happy with all the messing about and I think they should compensate me, she said she would email me some vouchers but she never did. She said she was launching an inquiry in to the warehouse to locate my return an this may take a few days. After 2 days they email me saying they are refunding me but not at the price I paid but the discount price is been given on my second order!! For gods sake I’ve never know such incompetence ever, first time I’ve ordered on line an never again in fact never shopping at gap again. I call customers services to sort it all out again and went though having to explain the whole issue I’d been going through the advisor was rude and hung up on me so I had to call back again and again explain to another advisor called Debbie who within seconds clearly didn’t want to hear me moving about my longwinded story and refunded me for the first order at the price I paid. She couldn’t get me off the phone quick enough! Always speak to an American call centre and out of the 8 times I had to call all the advisors were trying to help me but two were rude patronising and the tone on their voice smarmy and sarcastic made me really annoyed. At last all of this hassle and I’ve been told I will get my refund but how long that will take I don’t know. I wish I’d have seen all these reviews before attempting to buy a jumper on line. Awful experience and I will never shop in gap online or in store again. A company this big really needs to get their act together. Stay away at all costs!

Gap,Widespread quality control issue.,"Ive been a GAP customer for over 20 years. Quality was okay before but now you cant even breath on thier garments and they fall apart. In the last few years I have purchased sweatshirt hoodies, jeans, socks and t shirts, and i can safely say that all of these are now in a bin liner and being used as shop rags for when i do services on my cars. The socks all had holes in after one wear. The waistbands on all the hoodies have loosened after one wear and turned into baggy dresses. The jeans have all worn out and split at the crotch after only 2 washes. GAP if you are reading this I am more than happy to show you your rubbish clothing, but you probably dont need to do that as your buying and QC teams are well aware of how shoddy your clothing has become.

They cancelled my entire order by accident when one item suddenly wasn't available, then overcharged me by more than double when I reordered and don't understand that if you pay by debit rather than credit card, the money goes directly out of your account at time of purchase, it's not only an authorisation of funds. About 11 emails and another week later and just now a phone call to customer service, no refund of the overpayment though they admitted their mistake and I just received an email with no explanation cancelling my entire order again. Absolutely disgraceful, avoid like the plague. Also, no attempt to actually fix the problem with the order, which I explained I did actually want, abismal service and extremely inefficient and bad for business.",0,1

Gap,"Horrible Customer Service, and CC policies","I wish I could give a lower score than 1 Star. Their customer service is the absolute WORST. I wasted 40 minutes in their store today while they tried to look up my card, only to be told I’ll have to call customer service on my own time to - probably never - resolve my issue. My advice is DO NOT get a GAP credit card, unless you’re a fan of headaches. I completely regret getting the credit card, and I’m not going to even bother shopping there again to redeem my rewards after my waste of time today. University Village Gap store in Seattle had awful customer service. The manager was barely willing to lift a finger to help. And was annoyed that she had to reexplain their ridiculous policy. No apologizes, no real sympathy, no offering how to make it easier in any way. Repeat: DO NOT GET A CREDIT CARD. And save yourself from the staff at U village GAP, and shop... anywhere else.",0,1
Gap,I ordered a couple shirts for my Dad…,"I ordered a couple shirts for my Dad for Fathers day. I used the expedited 1 day shipping. I ordered them on a Thursday thinking that the order would be processed on Friday and delivered on Saturday, the day before Father's day. Well not so. Gap doesn't tell you an expected ship date until a couple days later and now I find out that the order won't make it in time for Father's Day. I called them and told them it never said the delivery date would be so much later than 1 day, they said I should have found their delivery policy online. I asked them to refund the expedited delivery and they said they would not do that. So you are going to hide the expected delivery date from your customer, and then won't refund the cost of the expedited shipping once it was clear that there wasn't any notification during ordering. This is bs. Gap also didn't inform me that this purchase would be a Mail Only return until after I was sent the confirmation email for the order. If I had known that you can't return the item in the store, I would have shopped somewhere else. I am NEVER using gap online ever again. Borderline criminal.",0,1
Gap,most appalling customer service,"Honestly - most appalling customer service I had ever encountered anywhere! All is well with GAP until problems arise. I have recently encountered two issues which needed customer services help.1. My log in stopped working. The girl on the phone admitted she did not have a clue and that was where conversation ended. That is it. No, they cannot help me with that.2. Having lost the receipt, my return was not accepted. Although, online info says """"Without proof of purchase and order date, you can return items for a merchandise exchange or a merchandise certificate only based on the selling price on the date of return.” No. That is not possible. Just not possible. They don't do that sort of thing. That online information probably means something else.Emailing does not get you anywhere. They do not respond. Or you will probably get a reply with selective irrelevant answers.What a joke! Avoid. Go somewhere else. Plenty of shops around.",0,1

Gap,Terrible delivery and products always out of stock,Never have an update on when certain products will be restocked. Noticed they are phasing out popular jeans and bringing out more expensive ones that don’t differ much compared to the cheaper ones. Customer service recently couldn’t give me an answer as to why Hermes said a package of mine was delivered and signed for by me. I was at home all day and a delivery attempt was not made. Instead of looking into this with Hermes I was told by Gap to wait to align with their internal timings for raising delivery disputes. While they have my money for a package that is either lost or stolen. Similar has happened to my parents with a Gap packaged delivered by Hermes - left in a safe space a week ago but no package in sight. Gap have not done anything. Hermes can apparently do no wrong.,0,1

So Gap think it's perfectly acceptable to take ONE MONTH to refund you. Then the 'Advisor' cut me off. I am absolutely disgusted by this, having bought lots from Gap stores in the past, I will never buy from Gap again. First time from their website, and the last time. Never in store again either out of principal.Continue such disgraceful customer service Gap and you'll end up with no customers!",0,1

Gap,I ordered a WINTER jacket for my 12 …,I ordered a WINTER jacket for my 12 year old son on December 1st it said it was supposed to take 6 to 12 days for delivery. 18 days later we still did not receive the jacket so I decided to call customer service. The woman on the phone explained to me that the jacket was never shipped from them it was supposed to be shipped from a store and the store must not have had the jacket in stock so they were unable to fulfill the order. So the store who had no jacket to ship left it at that our card was charged we did not receive product left it at that if I would not have called I wonder what would have happened. No emails no apologies and now almost 3 weeks later my son has no winter jacket mind you we live in Minnesota mind you that not a Gap store around us even sells winter jackets in the store there's a problem right there hello it is Minnesota why can we not carry jackets in the store why do I need to order them online. Anyways after I cancelled the order this morning to get my refund because apparently there was no jacket ever but nobody was ever going to tell me that. I was sent an email telling me that my item has been returned we returned our item and we will be refunded no we did not return anything we never received it and we were charged for it a lot of other places don't charge you until the item is shipped like there's a huge problem here that needs to be resolved and the only thing that was done about it it was covered up and hidden from maybe somebody who could fix the. By saying that we return the item looks like we didn't like it that never happened we never received an item. And now it's going to take up to 10 days for us to get our money back for something we never even had in my book that's stealing they stole our money if we did that to them they would have put us in jail thank you gap for all your wonderful years of wonderful beautiful comfortable clothing but my relationship with you has came to an end.,0,1
Gap,North Korea probably has faster shipping and better service,"Awful. Ordered 27th of November and my order was only shipped on the 10th of December, after numerous times chatting their customer service. They were never helpful and kept just sending macros and pre-written 'apologies' about the delay. They promised me overnight shipping and even swore that it would be shipped from the UK to Ireland at 10pm on the 7th of December for arrival on the next morning. Obviously it didn't turn up. Following that I got an email saying they're backlogged and it could take 30 days (!?) to ship, maximum. I ordered two things. I've bought cheap tat from China without tracking that's arrived faster.So on the 10th, I get an email saying it's shipped. Phew. That's a relief. But no, no it isn't. The tracking still hasn't updated as of the 12th - so I chat them again. The girl straight up offers me a refund. I didn't even ask - which makes me think something was up. I did ask, 'So I'm not getting my order - given it was mean to be overnighted?' and she said it looks unlikely. So now I have a charge on my account waiting to be reversed for an order I placed 3 weeks ago - that was never sent. Just awful all around.

Here is where things become ugly ,when I did not receive the items on that dateI checked in to see the order status and was changed to be delivered on December 05 ,2017(Still okay with this:)). I started following on the status knowing that they might change it again and when I checked again on the 4th of December 2017,they again updated the delivery date to the 09th of December and now I called to customer service knowing that they might do something about it.The person(male forgot his name?) I talked to was nice and willing to help me with that. First he said sorry for that and took off the shipping and handling fee and guaranteed it will be delivered on the 06th of December. I followed up and saw the status is still on the 09th of December and I thought he might forgot to update me. I called again on the 05th of December to talk to another agent (her name may be Amanda? sorry for that)She said that I need to call to the carrier(Which I thought is none of my business) to hold the item in their facility until I return back( what?)I told her I need the item as a gift to the persons I'm traveling to. She keep on holding me a lot of times as if she's figuring out something(Which I don’t think much is going on while I was in hold...probably I was in hold for 20minutes) anyways, She comes backand told me she is taking off 30% of the price I was charged, Still told her I don’t need the price adjustments and needed to talk to the supervisor. She told me thatthe supervisor will do nothing at all and I told her I will at least try my chances to pass my concerns. After the usual long hold, I 'm able totalk to the supervisor(which do nothing as the agent suggested, at least the agent got this right:)) to my surprise to inform me that the order is cancelled and the amount will be credited(What?) Did I tell you to cancel my order? the Supervisor is horrible and I don’t think she should be there. I told her why they are losing customers toAmazon and other big players and told her I will never be GAP's /Banana Republic's customer anymore(thank you for taking my money for more than a decade) and will write my experience onthe review to their site and any social networking sites I use.

But wait! they are calling me from 15 to 27 times a day literally starting at 7am and up until 11pm constant calling Even though I had spoken to a costumer service right after I came back and explained what happend and what is my plan they said It is absolutely understandable and that they will be expecting next payment when it is due. But the calling never stopped I had to block one of their numbers because it feels absolutely wrong to receive this many calls after you spoke to someone about it but now they call from Russia .

However, the now unwanted supposedly cancelled jeans showed up the next day! Another call to online customer service and more time on hold, and as a courtesy I was told I could keep the jeans and they would credit me back the price. Unfortunately we no longer needed the jeans because I had bought another set and they were the wrong size anyway. The agent on the phone at the time said just take them back to the store and exchange them for something else. But the store won't honor the exchange because it was a dispute with gap.com, and gap.com won't honor the exchange because they have terrible customer service. It doesn't help me to have free jeans that don't fit, so the courtesy they extended to acknowledge the hassle they put me through is meaningless.

Gap,Terrible customer service,"I noticed that I placed an order online and when it reached the time frame for when my order would be delivered (8-12 business days) my order had still not even shipped.When I reached out to customer service their response was-- contact us after 12 days and we will discuss it.A good company would promise expedited shipping and meet their promised date range, not tell their customers to reach back out after their packages are late. I would not recommend gap for any holiday shopping as they seem to have no interest in backing up their promised delivery date ranges, unless you are Jewish. Seems like if you plan for the first day of Chanukah, you will maybe get it by the last!",0,1
Gap,What! Gap?!,"Awful. Ive waited 2 weeks for a pair of jeans (still haven't arrived). When I asked why., they sent a link to the courier service so that I could try to fix the problem. Arrogant company. Truly awful online service. Never again !!!!!!!!",0,1

Gap,WORST COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! For some reason I was signed up for the cap credit card. When I received the first letter they sent me about it, I called their customer service and they said that my application would be deleted and everything was taken care of. I then received another letter today. THREE WEEKS AFTER they said it was taken care of saying that my credit card was approved. I then had to call @gap again where I was hung up on and transferred SEVERAL times to finally speak to someone that could help me. She was unbelievably rude and unhelpful. She said that my application was redacted and when I asked for my name and details to be removed from the system she proceeded to create an inquiry into this, and said I would receive a letter in twenty days. When I asked why it would take twenty days to just delete my basic information from the system and what the letter would say she was unable to give me any further information. And then threatened me that she would not send my inquiry in. Needless to say I am extremely annoyed, aggravated, and among other things will not be supporting @gap at any of their stores or sister stores. It is a complete outrage to be treated like this when this is @gap mistake. I posted this on Gap's Facebook page and they responded almost a day later that they do not deal with the card accounts and I need to speak to Synergy Bank that is in charge of this. So now I have wasted my time yesterday and do not understand what the woman I spoke to on the phone was doing?",0,1
Gap,Great styles and very unique,"Have loved this store since its launch,always find a bargain as they have sales so often,stylish clothes that wash well time after time,am not someone who likes to wear the same as everyone else,so you will never have that problem if you shop here,have always found the delivery fast and within the time they say.",0,5

Gap,Appalling Customer Service,"If you can, avoid shopping with Gap online from Austalia. Western Australia doesn't have a Gap store so my only option was ordering goods from the US (even after phoning the Melbourne store but they wouldn't post). The shipping of two pairs of girls shorts cost $42, almost as much as the shorts alone were worth. After a week, I inquired about the shipping advice (given I hadn't received a dispatch confirmation) only to be told that the goods had already been delivered. The problem was that I was in Australia and the goods had been delivered to somewhere in Illinois, US. After corresponding with Gap and asking them to resend the goods but expedite the shipping, given I had lost a week from the original timeline, I was advised post-shipment that the original timeline of the order had been extended and that they may take between 2.5 to 5 weeks to arrive, not counting the week lost from the incorrect delivery. The original advice communicated from Gap in the sales transaction was 2-4 weeks. Gap customer service was at best ambivalent, seemingly wanting to shift responsibility to Borderfree. When paying A$42 for shipping for a package of probably less than 1kg, I expect better service, as I can imagine, would others. Additionally, after further correspondence with Gap's customer service, they stated that if I was unhappy with their online ordering that I could set up a US address and ship there. It's quite stunning really that a company like Gap would offer this as an alternative rather than improving global business and addressing deficiencies in their point to point shipping. Put simply, avoid shopping online at Gap from Australia until they actually start to listen to customers. Until then, they are only paying lip service about customer service and overcharging overseas customers with exorbitant shipping rates.",0,1
Gap,poor customer service & costly!,"I bought on-line a number of long-sleeve tops for me here in Australia a couple of weeks ago (Jan 2016)The tops arrived & some were too small. Returning them was a nightmare & in total I am more than $100 out-of-pocket in delivery fees & have nothing to show. I returned them which was complicated but by the time I had the medium were all sold out! What a complete & utter waste of time & money. Won't bother again, will stick to LTS @ least they send out new order post-paid. Shame on you GAP.",0,1
Gap,Bad Customer Service and lack of Intergrity,"Customers please beware of gap store both in store and online. My unpleasant experience began on Jan 30, 2016 at gap store in Wolfchase mall in memphis TN. I meant with Manager David and Customer Rep Darren, who after a completed transaction so they called it could not give me a confirmed receipt they placed online stating the email would come, even until today Feb 9, 2016 I have not received the so called transaction. They were giving flimsy excuses about wifi this or that... Later come to find out my order was messed up as of today and the prices as they showed me in the store was not the prices the online associates put. As an evidence, My credit card when I called them had a recorded voice of myself and the rep telling the amount of price to approve for the transaction. My point here is please BEWARE of gap store both online and in store, they are not what they say they are... They perform fraudulent activities on your account if you do not monitor your account on a regular basis and their customer Service is very very very poor. They lack transparency and Intergrity.Customers PLEASE BEWARE!!!! Will NEVER BUY from GAP AGAIN. What a horrible experience. Still shocked from what they performed on my credit card without approval. Thanks to my credit card who caught on very fast.",0,1
Gap,Unreliable shipping policy,"While I like the clothes from Gap, their shipping policy is totally unreliable.On several occasions, I received notice of a delivery date, only to have it postponed with no explanation. In one instance, after two such delivery ""adjustments,"" my order finally arrived almost three weeks after the original projected delivery date. The ""helpful"" calendar they provide to show when the order will arrive is totally useless when Gap keeps sliding the date.I am now waiting for a package that was originally due to arrive on Feb. 2. The date was then changed to the 5th. No delivery. When I last checked, I was informed that the package could not be tracked. And so it goes....",0,2

Gap,Email customer service much better than Phone,"I had an issue that has just been resolved. When I originally called the customer service on the phone, they said there was nothing I could do about itWhen I emailed shortly after that, they only took a day or two to respond (which was quick since it was during what I'm sure is their busy season), and completely resolved my issue, needing me only to call and confirm a few thingsWould be 5 stars if I never had to deal with the phone customer service",0,4
Gap,Very Bad Customer Service,"I visit the Canóvanas Outlet in Puerto Rico, very distant of my country only for shop in Gap Outlet. Im shop in Gap for 20 years. It was to my favorite shops. When I choose my merchandise and I go to pay with my Old Navy credit Card, the cashier say that I cant use my credit card because my ID was expired. My ID have mi SS , my picture and all my personal info. I said her that a few month ago I applied to the Banana Republic card with the same ID and I dont have any problem. She call the manager. I explain the same to him and he was rude. He said is the Company Policy. I said him and alternative option to call the credit card services to confirm my identity and he said that is not possible. I call to the credit card services and the guy who attended the call explain that yes, is possible the manager call to confirm my identity to use my credit card. He understands that the id is only for identifying proposite. I return to the store and I explain to the manager and he call with bad attitude to the Credit Card Customer Service.

Gap,50% sale should be 50% sale with no exceptions,"sales were marked 50% for the whole store in the somerset mall except for 2 pants that were not labeled that those were excluded from the sales. There was no sign at all. the poor cashier couldnt do anything against because he cannot decide that. i am very diapointed in the gap company. I my opinion this is dishonest and not really customer friendly.This was the last time i visited a gap store.The competeting store next door had 50 %off everything. There were some things excluded but those were CLEARLY labled. There i found pants for 25$, which is even less than half the price of the gap pants i bought and then returned after i got the other ones.Please rethink your policy and the next sales!!!A disapointed customer",0,1
Gap,Horribly slow shipping and very poor customer service.,"I placed an order on 11/28 and didn't receive it until 12/22. The order wasn't even processed until 12/7. I called 3 times and all the customer service reps did was blame FedEx for the shipping delays and look online and read me the shipping status. After the second time I called I was told if I didn't receive my order by the following Monday I should call back and they would take action. I called the following Monday when I still hadn't received my order and their ""action"" was to once again read me the shipping tracking. When I told them to cancel my order and refund my money I was told I'd have to wait to refuse the package and I'll be refunded once they receive it and process the return, which will likely take another month. I refused the package when it finally arrived and I will never again order from Gap. I've been a loyal customer for over 25 years but no more!",0,1

Gap,"Poor customer service, your online delivery people made a mistake and I have to pay for it?","My mom had 100 dollars Gap Cash from when she shopped in NY with my sister. In Colorado, we decided to each spend 100 in Gap, she paid for everything and I paid her back. Before going in, I looked at some Gap ""featured"" outfits and really liked the plaid Henley shirt paired with the flair out pants. We got to the store, but only one plaid Henley shirt was there in XL, not my size. However, I did find the flair out pants. My mom had liked a silk shirt I showed her online, but it also wasn't in store because it was a new style. My mistake, to look online and expect to find it in store. So, we bought the things we could in store, and the cashier ordered the silk shirt and plaid henley, both in medium, through Gap.com. Three weeks later, the package arrives (it took a while), inside was the silk shirt, but instead of the Henley shirt, there is a pair of leggings with a label on it saying it is the plaid Henley. I research online to see which store in Colorado might have the plaid Henley in the right color and size medium. Unfortunately, shirt is sold out online in s, m, and l. The only store that has the right shirt style is in Aurora, 45 minutes away from my house. I put on hold the Medium and Large, the medium was in the wrong color but i was trying it for size, my last resort if the large didn't work being to have my sister in NY get it, which would be complicated because it's an exchange and not just a purchase. Finally, i get to Gap in Aurora and decide the Large is ok. But, because the plastic was labeled as plaid henley and had leggings in it, they said I could not just give them the leggings in exchange for the shirt. The whole process took at least 30 minutes, mostly the employee was getting instructions from a lady on the phone. My review is not against the Gap employees at this store, but rather the lady who was on the phone and Gap.com. Anyways, I didn't just walk out with the plaid Henley (already paid for mind you), I had to pay for the shirt and then now have to ship the leggings to Gap and wait 7 days to be refunded for the shirt. It was so complicated and I have to to all this extra work now. Hopefully I will even be refunded correctly because the receipt from paying today said the tax was 8%, whereas the invoice from online (what was paid before) says 4.25%. What I paid for the plaid Henley was also 50 cents more than the original purchase. So basically, I may be out just a couple dollars, which is ok, but annoying, gas, and time spent. Not much, but it's a lot when it wasn't my mistake and they still make me pay for THEIR mistake. I don't even want this shirt that bad anymore, it didn't fit that nicely because my boobs are too big for it and so the large fit better for that reason, but is wider than would be most flattering. Whatever, I'm ok with that though. Nevertheless, I'm never shopping at Gap or any affiliate stores again because this experience was so annoying and I think their clothes are boring (At Gap).I honestly don't want anything from Gap, like restitution, but they just better refund me correctly. Originally I paid 35.80 for the shirt (cheaper since we used gap cash) but today I paid 37.75 because the shirt cost more and the tax was double. So which will they refund me? The ladies at the store said they'll refund the invoice which is less than what I paid today. Why am I paying for your mistake??",0,1
Gap,Appalling customer service and bad quality control of clothing items,"I received a pair of jeans through the post which had been obviously poorly manufactured due to the fact that the fit in each leg was completely different: tight in one leg and loose in the other. As a result I called Gap Customer Service and they told me they couldn't exchange items but could refund them and get me the same pair of jeans at the same discounted price that I got them in before, which seemed like a rather arduous and unnecessary process. However, the assistant out in a new order to the same delivery location that I previously had them delivered to, without heeding me or asking any questions. I wanted to get the jeans sent to a work address because unfortunately I do not always have the luxury of being at home. Even after explaining this I was simply told that the order couldn't be cancelled definitively and the assistant would have to put in a cancellation request that doesn't always go through, which would have ended up in me getting 2 pairs of the same jeans. I guess I will have to hope the neighbours are in or else I will have to spend one of my Saturdays travelling off to a collection depot miles outside of London. What joy!",0,1
Gap,"Poor attitudes, poor service, poor quality","I have been shopping for 25 years at Gap. I have an account in good standing. My children all wore gap clothes growing up. I purchased Gap apparel because we had a large family and the clothing wore so very well. I shop at both the Keystone Mall Store and at the Edinburg outlet store. My daughter who also has a Gap account had been in the outlet store and spent over 200.00$. She had purchased mostly for her children but also bought herself a pair of very soft sweat pants the middle of May. After 4 washing th e fabric had broken down so much you could SEE through it. She purchased then May11 but by July they were literally threadbare. She returned them(10.99) on sake because the fabric was defective! She had her receipt but was advised they don't accept returns that have been ""washed or worn"" or past 90 days. So.... Buy wet beware if you receive anything defective and you have washed it or worn it you CANT return it. The asst. manager was not pleasant or helpful and ""we were informed it was corporate policy"". I have a feeling that ""corporate isn't doing too well"". You used to be able to depend on quality clothing- now it pills and in the case if the pants see through after a few washing. I can only compare them to J.Crew located in both locations that Gap is. The J.Crew staff is exceptionally helpf and nice and they stand behind their merchandise. Also the store is well kept and attractive- not a mixed up mess as the Gap store is. When customer service and quality sag it's time to shop somewhere else!",0,2

Gap,Bad Customer Service (Store # 0138),"We shopped at Gap Valley Fair today (bought over 20 items for the kids) and they ran out of big bags. The cashier (K) gave us multiple small bags and insisted to charge $0.10 / bag. When we got home, we realized that she double charged us for an item and we reported to the store. The store staff (E) told us to come to the store to review the video which would take about 20 minutes. We requested (E) to make note and perhaps investigate before we show up -- she refused. This means, I have to leave work, go to the store, wait for them to view the video and give me the $15 refund - ridiculous! This is unacceptable. Gap should value their customers' time and make effort to address the issue.",0,1
Gap,Hope you dont need help from a supervisor,"Called to change an address on my order because Gap used an address that I had never shipped too.

It don’t take a lot of ""know how"" to do this but for some reason they were unable too. Lol Glad I don’t work with that group.

Gap,Bond Street GAP Store - Outstanding,"I stocked up on my winter wear on Friday this week. Initially started at the GAP store on Regent Street. I was in the Regent Street Store for all of 15 minutes, I had to escape due to the broken speakers blaring out music at the top volume and also staff that were unsure of promotions as well as being unaware of their customers in store.After being let down in Regent Street I decided to go to the bond Street Store and was there for an hour. Took my time choosing and trying what I needed and the staff were super friendly and efficient from fitting room, shop floor to the till point. The floor manager (I assume) even stopped a briefing with some of the staff on the floor to ask me what size I could like in a jumper she saw i was looking at and contemplating. Thats service.The service in this store was amazing, not too much, but enough for you to feel valued and looked after if you needed it. It also has better stock options.

Gap,Over the years GAP increases prices and decreases quality. How disappointing.,"I have never in my life had a problem with jeans wearing out. That's why I bought from GAP. Yes, their product was moderately expensive, but they fit me fantastically and moreover they LASTED. I would get new jeans more because of growing out of them or significant style changes, but usually I'd wear them for two or three years with no problem whatsoever. In recent years though prices have climbed. What's more, to add insult to injury the quality has plummeted. The company where I used to get jeans for $45 and keep them for three years now charges me $70 for jeans that rip or wear through in a little more than a year. (I am no more active while wearing my jeans than I used to be, if anything I am less so!) Stubbornly I use iron-on patches and rotate the poorer quality pairs into less public/frequent use. Today though is perhaps the final straw. A pair roughly one year old suddenly has a sizable hole on the inner thigh. I feel so betrayed. For over 10 years I give brand loyalty to GAP and this is how I am repaid? By considerably more expensive but far poorer quality products than when I first began shopping with them? If only because I have an unused gift card I will give them one final chance. But after that I plan to find a new brand.",0,2
