H&M,Never received my order ‚Ä¶,Never received my order and my delivery email stating it has been delivered days ago... I contacted customer service and they claim I have to wait 2 weeks to BEGIN an investigation to get my money back. I should have checked the reviews on this place before ordering. But I assumed with them being a well known store they would know how to ship online purchases. It‚Äôs too bad they run a business like this just to run it to trash. Never never never will I order from here or shop in this store again. Don‚Äôt waste your time buying from here... just look at the reviews. H&M you should be ashamed of yourself!!!,0,1

H&M,SCAMMERS,"I only gave one star as i had to. Terrible customer service, sent me wrong items, very low value wrong items, baby clothes in fact in replacement for my teenage sized sports clothes that equalled nearly 40 quid. And THEN they say i cannot have my money back UNTIL they receive the wrong stuff they sent. Yes, i've sent the parcel back TWO WEEKS AGO and still haven't got my money back. I can see how this is going to go, i'm not stupid. I am reporting to Trading Standards and WILL NEVER SHOP AGAIN WITH H&M. I suggest everyone else does the same. Terrible company with even worse customer service.",0,1
H&M,The worst delivery service ever!I order‚Ä¶,The worst delivery service ever!I order one week ago and I still haven‚Äôt got the order even though it‚Äôs said that it is on the way.I returned an item 2 weeks ago and I still haven‚Äôt received any email of confirmation.Bad Bad H&M because of this I prefer ordering on Zara which deliver next day as well free of charge .,0,1
H&M,My daughter often shops at H&M,"My daughter often shops at H&M, fair to them they have a huge variety of fashion clothes to choose from at reasonable prices. My issue is the incorrect and misleading sizing especially on their dresses and women‚Äôs jeans. My daughter is a UK 10, she came home with a pair of jeans that were sized 14 (her receipt said size 16). For the last week I noticed she was eating very little food. When I asked her why she replied that she had put on weight as her jean size was now 14 and that she had to lose it. I have always taught her that all women are beautiful whatever size they are, it really shouldn‚Äôt matter. But due to bullying at school my child has had issues with body dysmorphia. She struggles every day to like herself. As I myself had put the jeans in her wardrobe I know for a fact they were not size 14 (31 inches) so I measured them. They came up at 28 inches (womens jean size 8). I have noticed this with a lot of H&M Oxford Street clothing. Their buying, production and import departments need to address this issue immediately, as they are causing untold damage to young women who are already having to struggle and fight with mental issues concerning low body image, self esteem and eating disorders! As a fashion house specifically catering to young people H&M should seriously check themselves and stop skimping on size just so they can get a few more pairs of jeans out of a couple of yards of material. Profit should not come before mental well-being!",0,1
H&M,Worst shipping ever!,Worst shipping ever!! Ordered on 3/31 said order was shipped 4/4 but it never left the warehouse! Then got an email that it would be delayed. Finally after still not recieving it on 5/5 i got my refund. I wont be buying there ever again! I get my items faster elsewhere.,0,1

H&M,Customer service is a nightmare,"I don't know why I continue to order from here. Their clothes are decent but not worth the hassle of dealing with their customer service team. DO NOT - I repeat - do not attempt to use Klarna for installments. They do not communicate what happens with the order after you receive it so if you make returns or anything, you have to call each customer service team and sit on the phone for hours piecing together a solution for the clothes you ordered.",0,1
H&M,Great online customer service!,I think it's amazing online customer service. The chat works really well and I had my problems solved a few times within 5-10 minutes. Everyone should take a page from their book!,0,5
H&M,Repeatedly ignored.. Worst Customer Service!!,"I was in the Ingram Park Mall store today for over an hour and not one associate acknowledged me being in their store. And, BTW, I was the ONLY customer in the store... so not like they were busy or anything. Even though I was ignored I continued to shop and eventually chose a couple of items to purchase. Went up to the check out counter where there was not one but two associates at the counter... did I get acknowledged? NO! I stood there for 5 minutes at the counter (again, ONLY customer in line to check out) and finally said to the two associates ""ARE YOU OPEN??"" ... the response was ummm... yes, I am sorry. This will be the last time I shop at this store... I'd rather shop on line than be ignored repeatedly.",0,1
H&M,LOVE üíó,"LOVE üíó Okay so I have ordered a few times here and it is great!! The Items are of good quality, have a range of clothing pieces - all very trendy and some timeless pieces too. My orders always ship out quickly and receive within the estimated delivery time frame given. An Post always give a text/email beforehand to say they will be delivering.I‚Äôm quite shocked to see such bad rating here, I‚Äôve even had to return a few online bought pieces in store and I get the refund within a few days! I haven‚Äôt returned through post but they do have a returns form attached inside the parcel.H&M have moved to using more eco-friendly packaging! Before it used to be in the typical plastic parcel bags but now they come in cardboard boxes bound by zip ties! How great that they are contributing to recyclable packaging. The individual items are each wrapped plastic so even if the packaging gets wet from the weather, your items are protected!I always receive an order confirmation email and despatch confirmation email! I never have to contact customer service because their system is just that smooth! The only thing I would say is that some of the clothing sizes vary so just read the reviews!Apart from that I have no cons just really pros so if you‚Äôre thinking of ordering, do it!",0,5
H&M,awful customer service,"I placed an order last week for almost ¬£200. Got am email today telling me it's been delivered by Hermes. However there was nothing at my door. When checking the picture of the delivery I noticed the property wasn't mine. I've asked a few neighbours, no one has seen anything. After calling HM customer service I was told that there is nothing they can do and I'll have to wait and inquire with Hermes in 10 days. What kind of service is this? I just spent ¬£200,m what kind of experience is that? Never again HM. I'll spend my money with businesses that care about customers!!!",0,1

H&M,H&M is the worst company to process‚Ä¶,"H&M is the worst company to process refunds. I have ordered on the 1st of April and at the end of April received the refund. Even if I returned the items same day I received them. Now let‚Äôs see how long it will take them to refund the next return. It is more than 12 days already.Also they are the worst in notifying when the order has been processed, about to be shipped, and delivered.",0,1
H&M,What has happened to your sizes????,What has happened to your sizes? I'm a size 10 in every other shop. I ordered trousers that had been reviewed as running small.

H&M,Contact your card company to get your money back.,"It‚Äôs going on two months with no merchandise being shipped. But I already knew that even though customer service assured me it will. It won‚Äôt. However, they certainly charged my daughter‚Äôs card immediately and their MO is to state it‚Äôs already processed and, therefore, you can‚Äôt cancel. Sorry that doesn‚Äôt cut it with me. Call your credit card company and file a claim. They will immediately give you your money back ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Äútemporary‚Äù as they will have to investigate the claim. But at least you‚Äôll be refunded. Her bank will take three months to investigate. Once they see that you never receive the goods, the refund amount will remain in your account. I recommend everyone doing this to put a stop on H&M taking your money. It‚Äôs disgusting and disappointing their policies and criminal acts are continuing. But take matters into your own hands. Less money for them and maybe they will go out of business or change the way they do business. We can only hope. This applies to both debit and credit cards. Check with your card company/bank/credit union to know your rights. Good luck! I‚Äôll repeat this message or pass it around so more people can stop dealing with their unhelpful customer service department.",0,1

H&M,Never received money bank,"Ordered ¬£100+ worth of clothes online. Never received any confirmation email or number. A day later I realised this and contacted live chat who apologised and said they had no order come through and that I would receive the money back within 3-5 days. I ordered again a second time, purchasing the items that were left in stock. Waited for the money to arrive for 5 days, still nothing arrived so I contacted live chat again for proof that the order did not go through correctly so that I could contact my bank and hopefully get my money back. I was very clear that I needed proof that the order did NOT go through correctly but the customer service rep didn't read what I wrote and just sent me confirmation of the second order which meant absolutely nothing to my bank as they can see that order already went through. It has now been a week and I am no closer to getting my money back.",0,1

H&M,They sent us two items we did not order‚Ä¶,They sent us two items we did not order and left out three items we had ordered. Very incompetent. Customer service was bureaucratic and unhelpful - told us to re-order the items we had already paid for and not received. The two items we had not ordered we had to return - not a big deal but a hassle for us to fix THEIR mistakes. This is the fourth (and last) time we are ordering from them as every order has had issues they made difficult to resolve easily and quickly. Not on the same planet as the rest of us.,0,1

H&M,Only Once had an Issue...and it was RESOLVED!,"This is so odd to see: all these negative reviews! I have always had ZERO issues purchasing, making returns or asking questions with H&M. I do recommend using the APP over the website, as it is MUCH more user friendly. If you have a SPC card, you get 15% off of sale and regular items, compact that discount with other deals they have going/your own rewards and you get insane deals with fast shipping. The only issue I ever had was back in November one of the limited edition Vampire's Wife dresses I ordered took a month to get to me, but I was kept updated AND offered a 20% off any item coupon to say sorry!",0,4
H&M,Sutton store: no sizes or prices on trousers. And no staff around to help,"Went in the Sutton store today. Almost impossible to tell the sizes and price of men's trousers. Searched all over several pairs and nowhere could I find any indication of either. For trouser you need to know the waist size and the leg length. Couldn't find that information anywhere and no staff around to ask. So left, and won't be returning",0,1

H&M,"Rugby store totally unhelpful, disinterested staff. Another shop off my list","Went to Elliott Fields store Rugby today. Selected a number of items I wanted including a pair of jeans in their sale. Pair I wanted (lighter colour) didnt have sale label on but identical pair (darker colour) did. Took them to til to check with staff. Young blonde male staff couldn't care less. Said it was still full price and 'someones obviously dumped them in the wrong place'. Firstly, the shop had been open 10mins so how is that possible. Secondly I pointed out that there were several all the same style reduced to ¬£12 including the pair id brought to him. I then told him to scan the pair that did have the reduced label on and surprise surprise that scanned at full price too...so evidently the staff hadnt labelled it up correctly. He then argued that it still wouldn't be the sale price! Total idiot. With this I dumped them and everything else I was going to purchase (would have been over ¬£100) and walked out. I'm gobsmacked at the lack of helpfulness and interest in this staff. Given the store has been closed and not selling for months you'd think they would be more inclined to actually give a damn and be keen to keep their jobs but no. Shame on you then H&M because when you go into administration like so many other stores of late you'll only have yourself to blame and your staff for being jobless! Due to this halfwit I won't bother shopping here or at any H&M again...other companies with better focus on service can take my custom in future.",0,1
H&M,Two mucked up orders and still don't have what I needed.,"Ordered baby tights and recieved this quickly. However the product didn't contain the full range of colours advertised and had two of one colour instead. I went to customer service who offered a return and refund, and to order it again with a 15% discount. Fine, perfect, did that and then they cancelled the order for no reason. Spoke to customer service again and it was cancelled due to incorrect stock numbers and it was out of stock. I expressed my annoyance and disappointment, and the agent offered me a 10% discount - less discount than was offered before. So, two mucked up orders, and a paltry 10% discount and I still don't have the product I need. I won't be bothering again.",0,1

H&M,H&M customer service lacking in UK,"I recently ordered from M&S and H&M, both companies used Hermes as their delivery agent. Both suppliers advised when the items were with Hermes and expected delivery dates. All down hill after that point. The M&S items were still not delivered after 2 weeks even though I had paid for a specific delivery date. In the end M&S provided a good will gesture (great customer service from M&S). H&M 10 days on from order and still no deliver, I have agreed with H&M to cancel the order, no good will gesture (they could learn from M&S). My question is why do such highly regarded brands rely on such a poor delivery agent when revenue from on-line delivery is so important to them? Come on H&M change your delivery agent in the UK.",0,1

The white and pink tee were fine, but the others had really poor material. It wrinkles in all the wrong ways and too thin. I ordered a blue shirt, they gave me green.

H&M,"website says one thing, in store say another.......","Just before lockdown 4.0 started I went and bought a number of items from my local H&M. Then Lockdown happened, I have 2 pairs of jeans I wanted to return so they sat in the bag with all labels and everything until the lockdown ended. Annoyingly I have misplaced the receipt, though by law I just have to be able to show proof of purchase which I can do via bank statements. Regardless I knew it was going to be a pain to get my returns in, but I spoke to someone online who reassured me there were absolutely no issues with what's happening in the pandemic and having clothes that are needed to be returned for 6 months loss of receipt was always going to be a thing. and kindly mentioned id also be able to exchange them if I wanted (i don't but I thought it was nice). Anyway, I went to the store last week when H&M reopened and was told there was no way they could do anything and that I would have to escalate the issue with H&M online if I wanted this to get resolved. It's extremely disappointing that this is the case, we have all struggled during the pandemic and I've needed this cash for 6 months. I will not be shopping there any longer and I want people to see how H&M treats their customers.",0,1

They also had an inferior range of clothing for men but surprisingly an abundance of clothing for women in all shapes and sizes.

Later that day I got an email saying it was shipped AND delivered all on the 6th of April. The package was no where to be found. I contacted the company on the 12th and they never responded. I contacted them multiple times by email then they finally replied and sent me a refund for my money. I was so mad because they admitted it was a warehouse issue and that means they didn‚Äôt even send the package in the first place. So this tracking info was FAKE and I will never receive the items I ordered. NOW 5/12 items I ordered are OUT OF STOCK! pissed off b/c they only gave me 25%Off.

Upon reading other reviews, it seems H&M have a reoccurring issue with stock inventory not being accurate, resulting in the sale of goods they don't actually have (despite the Live Chat advisor insisting this is a very rare). Unable to cancel the remaining item so having to wait until the package is returned to sender. Not a hassle-free experience and won't shop with H&M online again.",0,1

When I tried to call in they said there was nothing they could do to help me, they couldn't put my order on backorder and fulfill when it came in. They said my only option was to sign up on their website for alerts on when the item was back in stock. I did that, and when I was emailed that the item was back in stock I immediately clicked the link to order it, but the website said it was out of stock. Honestly, for such a massive, international company, they should be able to figure out how to manage orders and inventory. That was the last time I will try to order anything from them.",0,1

Manager told me they had to let it ship and then I could return it . So not very environmentally friendly they still have my order not even processed and they can‚Äôt cancel.

H&M,Customer Service Lied 3 Times About Changing Delivery Address,"Called customer service to change delivery address. Agent said no problem and changed it. Called next day to confirm it was changed in time after UPS tracking email said it was going to old address, H&M confirmed the updated address on the account and assured me it was a glitch on my mobile app that it still showed the old address.Called UPS- they say their records say the old address, but H&M can still change it if they contact UPS. Called H&M back, agent now says the address was never changed and they don't have the power to do that (and that only UPS can). Called UPS yet again, they say H&M is lying and that they absolutely still have time to change it- they probably just don't wanna take on that cost.H&M says that there's nothing they can do, that I can't cancel the order or initiate a refund yet- and have to wait 30 days. It's a $300+ order. They won't even create a ticket on the issue so there's a record of my notices about the address changes.The express shipping I paid for has also mysteriously disappeared off the order. Still have proof I was charged it in the order confirmation email and bank transaction history. H&M customer service is an absolute mess. All the agents are nice and clearly trying to be helpful, but given that 3/4 flat out lied about changing my address, I say avoid ordering from here.",0,1

H&M,H & M Hennes & Mauritz,"H & M Hennes & Mauritz ‚Äî Harassment from a store employee in Portland, MaineYes, first of all I love your store. I have shopped and purchased goods in Nice, France in Portland, Maine and in other locations. You have great products at a great price. But I would like to file a complaint against your Portland, Maine store. There is an employee there who has pink hair. I don't know what her name and her pink hair is fine, but her attitude is not.The two times that I've been in the store recently she's treated me very aggressively and in a very rude manner. The first incident I went into the store with a clear plastic mask covering my mouth and nose which she required me to take a covered mask or leave. The second incident I was checking out and she very forcefully told me to pull my mask up over my nose, which it was nearly covering and which was very humiliating as I was in the checkout line. I declined because of her rude aggressive nature and I said I will not pull my mask up and at that point because she was so rude, I decided not to make my purchase at your store. I peacefully walked out of your store.I am a leader and a CEO and I have access to hundreds of people and I was very tempted to let all my friends and colleagues know what happened in your Portland, Maine store, but out of respect for your company, I did not do that, but I really think that you need to take action because you have a PR problem in your Portland, Maine store. After my two negative experiences there, I really don't want to go back and do business with H&M in Portland, because of the one employee with the pink hair.I look forward to hearing what kind of action you are planning to take and will base my next steps and decisions upon your actions. You need to know that if nothing is done, many other people will hear about my experience in your store. Again thank you H&M for a great store and a great product and I wish you all the best.Cordially, Jon",0,4

H&M,H&M basically stole $357.73 -from a single mom,"I placed a $357.73 online order for my 9yr old daughter. I've been dressing her in H&M fashions since a baby. I updated my address in the app yet it did not take and my order confirm showed my old address. Within an hour & half I called the rep told me ""We can not cancel your order, since more than 30mins has passed since placing the order"" she said I had to wait to receive a shipping notice and at that point once the package had shipped I had to call UPS to have the package re-routed. So I did I waited 2weeks and did exactly what I was told however UPS does not do ANY such type of thing. So I called back H&M of course they apologized they said I had to wait another 15days until the package was either returned to them or went missing they said because it is insured I would be refunded either way. I called after the 15 day period rep said sure I'll put your refund through right now then the call got dropped -I really thought she'd call me back as I had waited 30mins just to speak to some (every time I called by the way -a 30min wait) She did not call me back and she NEVER did process my refund. Turns out the package was returned I followed the tracking info ALL the way back to the warehouse so I called AGAIN for my refund they said well we can't find the package so we can't give the refund you till we find it (I pleaded to have the package resent to me as many items in it were sold out -they said sorry we don't do that) In between all of these phone calls I did texting chats with CS they always apologized for the misinformation I had received the times before and said don't worry you will receive the refund (I tried to save the chat conversations but they never were copied to my app or emailed to me -so that's another app disfunction) this all started last year April 2020 and still NO REFUND -NOTHING. MY $357.73 GONE. I've spent at least 6hours between phone calls and chat sessions.Because I spent SO MANY months going back and forth wasting time with H&M's CS Dept my bank will not assist with the dispute as too much time has passed..

Was in line for a good five minutes and once I became ""next in line"" a girl behind the counter asked if I had a mask. I stated I was exempt. She just looked me and her snarky coworker said ""Honey, not in here you're not"" (horrible grammar - but that's another post). I was asked to leave. I stated I just had a return. They threatened to call security. I left and donated my $5 shirt to Goodwill.I understand that the US has lost its ever loving mind over masks. But not having compassion for the one person in the store that isn't wearing a mask for health reasons seems to spit in the face of the company's view of tolerance and compassion.

I contacted customer service and the rep barely spoke english and said they couldn't send me the right item. that I had to return the wrong item to get a refund and then would have to reorder the right item. Ridiculous! if your company is going to screw up- it's your responsibility to fix it!,0,1

H&M,Terrible.,"My first order was fine, only took two weeks to ship and get here. The second order, however, was placed mid-November and took until mid-January to deliver. I had to go through the hassle of returning in-store as well. Just a warning, DO NOT buy t-shirts from H&M. Their sweaters, sweatpants, sweatshirts, etc are fine, but their shirts are the worst quality I've ever seen. One piece of clothing also had a hole, which didn't realize until after I'd returned the first batch, so I'll have to return that as well. Horrible quality and shipping for such a big brand. Customer service is ok at best, they take 5 minutes to respond to a simple yes or no question and will lie to you when you ask where on earth your order is.",0,1
H&M,Wrong size shirt delivered on 3 separate orders,"This review is a genuine experience based on 3 separate orders.H&M have, on 3 occasions, delivered a size L shirt when I've ordered a size S. Empty promises and hollow apologies were made by customer support whenever I called in to report this. ""We're really sorry and we promise this will never happen again!""The shirt I wanted was on a special promo price for H&M members. Since my first and second orders, the price reverted back to the original price. I have been ordering the correct size, and I find it frustrating that the warehouse staff appear to be illiterate or careless when picking and packing items for the customer's orders.I do not recommend ordering from H&M until they resolve the illiteracy issue in their workforce.",0,1

H&M,Harassment Complaint,"Please be aware there are no signs posted throughout the store that say ‚ÄúNO TRY ON‚ÄôS!‚Äù I never went towards the dressing room to see any posted signs. As I stood in front of a mirror like a few other people in the store I tried on a shirt. A guy (Greg) came from behind with no greetings, very direct in his approach and assertive said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt try on cloths in the store.‚Äù My response was ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôm purchasing the shirt and leaving anyway.‚Äù He came up from behind a little bit closer as I took the shirt off and said ‚Äúyou better not try on nothing else in the store, get loud or make a scene. I will have you escorted out and barred from H & M. I looked him in the eye and said that‚Äôs not called for I‚Äôll called the police myself. Greg, then said other remarks as I approach the register to make my purchase. I never said anything else to him. I then ask the cashier (Nazha the cashier) what was his name and she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. You would have to ask him, I said to her so you don‚Äôt know who you work with on the daily. Blank stare and ignored my question, she completed the purchase with no proper response. I proceed to call customer service and they called the store to have someone come talk to me about the situation as I waited. I was disrespected by your selected management (the other Greg) for no reason. There is where I met Greg Burnette. He informed me he can write a dispute and wait for the store manager (Thomas) to talk with him about the incident because they (Greg and Greg B.) are equals in management. I don‚Äôt do DISRESPECT because I never cussed him, raised my voice or sassed him in conversation. This behavior is not appropriate representation, to excessive, intimidating, tone and delivery was unnecessary to convey one message.",0,1

H&M,It's ok,Loads of nice choices of kids clothes and easy to use website and checkout process. Occasionally you get discount codes for money off. I order stuff from here regularly.

H&M,Complete Mess,"First of all )This is a review of the store policies in general not the staff working at the store. Because every one of your store employees has always been helpful and quite ready to help so none of it is their fault.2) I have now been waiting for 3 weeks to receive an order that said would be here in 3-6 days. The only thing I received in that time was an email with ""Sorry, here is a 15% off your next order"". So you want me now to make yet another order and spend more money and this is best you can do? I wouldn't order again if you gave me 50% discount.3) I just found out today that online orders are not allowed to be exchanged for size or returned to stores. This is yet another bad policy and because of that I will never shop at H&M online.4) Fitting rooms closed due to pandemic. You are the only store that has them closed. This also made me shop more at other stores.5) Buying and using member or recycle program coupons, then taking clothes home to find out they don't fit and losing the discount. I lost 3 $5 coupons this way and at least one 10% off. It's like a punishment. Here, have a discount but you cannot try it on and too bad if you have to return it. Not cool.6)Trying to find a matching sweatshirt and pants set, I went to 3 locations and everywhere only l,XL,XXL sizes left in pants. After speaking with your staff they also agreed that buyers have no idea what to order. Then very kindly advised me to call the store on Monday to see if they got more sized in shipment so I didn't have to go there every day. This is where the ball was dropped again. I called a central number which refused to put me through to the store because they rather not have employees search.(An employee today told me that was a total BS). Upon which I was asked what I was looking for, which I specified and was told that yes the store in question (Coquitlam BC) had 3 pairs in that size. So I drove to the store and searched for it, asked few employees and was told that they did not receive those items and the information I was given was from inventory that was completely wrong. So thanks again head office.I can probably come up with few more reasons why I am giving it a 1 star, but I will stop now. As you can see you can make excuses over pandemic BUT your online shopping policy and phone policy still sucks. Tell me, how can other stores do it so well even now, but you can't figure it out? I am unfortunately stopping shopping now because this was the last straw, I enjoyed your clothing but I rather go shop at Zara, Aritzia, Dynamite, you name it, spend a bit more but at least be able to try it on, buy it, bring it back and no hustle at all...",0,1
H&M,"Terrible policy, not great customer service","Ordered a jacket for my husband late October that was too small. Due to hustle and bustle of the holidays and school, I just got around to exchanging it last weekend. Went to one mall that did not have the correct size so we went to get store credit and order it online (which had his size). Because we were past the 30 day return policy, we could only do in store exchanges. They don't give store credit. We could not order the correct size online with store credit. WHAT. I'm literally saying I will still give you my money, I would just like the correct size that is not currently in your store. I researched where I could find the correct size at another local store. I called to put it on hold (that was a nightmare in and of itself). Like other reviewers have said, it's a huge center that takes care of your call. They say that have it all set up for me (after a few calls from me) and they go to transfer my call to the store. After 5 minutes of waiting, my call gets dropped (total of 30 minutes on the phone working on this so far). I call back, explain, they transfer me to the store. They get my information, confirm everything and continue to ask which mall I'm calling from...? Eventually I clearly communicated I'm just a normal customer, not another mall.I go to exchange and pick up the jacket today, and it's not even the correct size. The store did NOT have any jacket my desired size because apparently they don't even carry jackets that large (which online using the 'find in-store' said they did have them). Terrible policy, I just want a correctly sized jacket, and at this point I would prefer to not even support H&M financially.",0,1
H&M,"Paid for 1 day delivery, delayed to 5","I ordered a couple of items on jan. 27 and paid for fast delivery (1 day). Because of some error I didn't receive a confirmation e-mail of my order.

I needed my items before friday evening, so it'd be just in time. Finally I got an e-mail, saying my order was being shipped. A little sidenote though: it would be delivered on the first of feb. (5 days total delivery), because they don't deliver on the weekends!H&M, don't make promises you can't keep. Don't make people pay for a service you can't deliver.Besides the disappointing order handling, the website is a complete failure as well because it glitches constantly.Conclusion: don't buy your stuff from H&M online.",0,1

H&M,Klarna Pay Later Option is pointless!,"I do not recommend ordering online and using the Klarna Pay Later option.

I didn't even receive my order until 1/13/21. According to the tracking, the order was in my city (Atlanta) and then shipped back to Tennessee and then back to Atlanta again.. huh what are you doing? Anyways, I returned all of my items except one on 1/15/21. I got an email that I am about to be charged for my order since it has been a month, so I reached out to customer service and asked for an update on my return. She stated that it takes 2-4 WEEKS for refunds to get back to them and they will send an email once confirmed. Then allow another 2 weeks for a refund to be processed. So basically the whole point of Pay Later is POINTLESS because you will STILL be charged the money!

BUT anything I exchange it for I still can't try on...so catch 22. I would be back in forth if doesn't fit. Manager would not concede to allow me a credit. Came home called customer service which ended up being a call centre innthe Philippines and all they would say is go to the store and talk to the manager.

H&M,Horrible Customer Service,"While H&M always seems to have good option clothing wise and is always fun to shop at, they have issues with gift cards. I ordered a $50.00 gift card on December 14th for my sister for Christmas, my sister never received the gift card. When I called H&M on 1/3/21 to either see the status of the card or to ask for a refund because the gift was never received, I was advised that the order was not successful and that it does not exist. I advised them that my card was charged so that made no sense. The agents that I talked to were very condescending and kept saying that it does not exist like I am the crazy one. I asked for them to look up the charge with the last for digits with my credit card that they charged, the agent seemed very put off that I even asked them to do this. I advised that I did not want to dispute it with my bank if we could avoid and I would appreciate them assisting me. The agent put me on hold, then asked a bunch of clarification questions and the said ""ya, this order does not exist, you should just dispute it with your bank"". Typically I understand that human error happens, even technology error happens but when someone calls for assistance I would expect help. Instead I got agents that were not friendly and treated me like I was stupid. I am sorry that you failed to supply your service and that I called because YOU charged me $50.00 for a gift card that does not exist. This is just overall sketchy and makes we wonder how many more people have fallen for the same scam. Unfortunately this has left a horrible taste in my mouth and I will never shop at H&M again.",0,1
H&M,Horrible store policy!,"Horrible store policy!! Got a gift card for Christmas. Purchased some items that I needed to return. Apparently, they do not let you return items for store credit even with the receipt. You are forced to exchange for equal amount. How stupid is that?? You can‚Äôt use the fitting rooms (understandable) so I have to come back 30 times to make exchanges of equal or more amount? Can‚Äôt return $30 worth of merchandise and exchange for $10 tee without buying more junk you don‚Äôt want. It forces you to return to the store about 50 times until you get it right. I HATE their policy. Will NEVER buy from them again!",0,1

Then, I returned that package and their customer service (which is very poor handled in the Philippines) the second time I called the agent, was asking me for my online password to my credit card. There are some thieves answering the phone. I asked for a supervisor who knew a little bit better but still made no difference in solving the problem. I have received an email notification from Canada post that the package I returned has been received by H&M. Now, my 3rd call and the agent said they need to have the package in their warehouse and I need to wait another 2.5 weeks for my refund to be process. This company is the worst of all that I have ever order online. Save yourself hassle and precious time and don't order from H&M.",0,1

What a fantastic Christmas gift that was!Ordering online is practically a scam, and I highly encourage an online shoppers to take their business elsewhere. Customer service is abhorrent, and H&M's business practices are borderline theft.

H&M,Terrible Customer Service,"I've placed two orders before Thanksgiving and both had gotten stuck in transit for over a month with USPS and H&M's customer service still made me wait weeks later for a refund. Even then, I had to make continuous calls to get my refund processed. The phone agents have a hard time communicating due to some sort of delay in the line. I'm guessing that this has to do with working remotely due to the pandemic. If you are going to place an order with H&M, expect a 50/50 chance that you will not receive your order and if you do receive it, it will be months later. Also, do not expect great customer service from the reps. You will be required to wait months before any rational action is taken on the order. Done shopping here.",0,1

H&M,Electronic Gift Card Fraud,"Buyer Beware!!! I am EXTREMELY disappointed with H&M. I recently purchased an online gift card (directly from the H&M site) as a birthday gift. When the person that was gifted the $120 gift card went to use it, there was only a $1 balance left on the card. I contacted both H&M and their third party electronic gift card issuer and after MANY hours and phone calls with both companies all that they came up with was that someone used the gift card on the US website, when the card was bought in Canada with Canadian dollars, and claimed that they were not responsible for someone fraudulently using the gift card. For a large international company I find this incredibly unacceptable. All I wanted was the gift card to be fulfilled. But now I have lost that $120...I will NEVER be purchasing from this company EVER again and suggest anyone who is looking to purchase an electronic gift card understands that their system is NOT secure and that they will NOT accept responsibility. TERRIBLE!!!",0,1

H&M,"Standards of clothing have dropped - fraying, bobbling, poor stitching etc.","Okay so i‚Äôm a swede with a bit of a bias. I love anything Swedish, that includes HM. I have not encountered any issues with their delivery time frames in fact most items ordered are delivered within 1 week. I have to say however, that the quality of their clothes have dropped significantly. Gone are the days where a HM jumper/tshirt would last more than a few washes. Now they fray, bobble or stitches unravel. It‚Äôs really upsetting because their clothes were of premium quality and the prices very modest! Now they have compromised their quality while upping their price tag. I can‚Äôt count the amount of times I‚Äôve had to return back items due to the above reasons outside of the 28 day return policy - luckily they have always refunded me with no fuss. But obviously the company should address this - it seems they‚Äôve grown so big that they manage customer satisfaction by guaranteeing a refund for faulty/poor quality items rather than addressing the issue head on (perhaps seeking a new manufacturing company?) which would improve customer retention in the long run). Will not shop with H&M again for anything other than basics (t-shirts, socks etc) regrettably.*I have noticed a lot of people complaining about the service received by south-east asian third party customer-service vendors. It‚Äôs unfair to assume they lack knowledge of HM‚Äôs policies simply because they operate from overseas. That kind of thinking is quite backwards actually.

There only concern was making money and not delivering. This outrageous circumstance has made me more aware of who and where I will spend my money, because at the end of the day my dollars matter.

No answer. Couldn't get through the prompts. I would get hung up on immediately. I tried chatting, and I would get a message thst all agents are busy and it wouldn't even let me queue in line. I complained on Twitter and a customer service person on there said they could help. Asked for my order info and then ghosted me. I tried following up over the last few weeks, no answer. I finally manage to get a chat rep tonight and they were rude and basically told me they couldn't do anything since the order processed... Lol like...

This is absolutely ridiculous that I was charged on the 23rd of November, with a 12 day shipping guarantee, and no items or refund even after almost a month.

If the seller doesn‚Äôt promise a shipping time, and you are applying for credit to pay for your purchase, the seller has an additional 20 days (50 days total) to establish the account and ship the merchandise.""When I contacted customer support (they didn't contact me), instead of being honest and up front they chose to lie and mislead me by telling me that my order was shipped, when in fact it hadn't.The following is copied and pasted directly from the FTC website regarding how companies are to handle shipping delays.""DelaysIf the seller is unable to ship within the promised time, it must notify you, give a revised shipping date and give you the chance to cancel for a full refund or accept the new shipping date. The seller also must give you some way to exercise the cancellation option for free ‚Äî for example, by supplying a prepaid reply card or staffing a toll-free telephone number. If you don‚Äôt respond ‚Äî and the delay is 30 days or less ‚Äî it‚Äôs assumed that you accept the delay and are willing to wait for the merchandise. If you don‚Äôt respond ‚Äî and the delay is more than 30 days ‚Äî the order must be canceled by the 30th day of the delay period and a full refund issued promptly.If the seller can‚Äôt meet the revised shipping date, it must notify you again by mail, email or telephone and give you a new shipping date or cancel your order and give you a refund. The order should be canceled and a refund issued promptly unless you indicate by the revised shipping date that you are willing to wait. If you don‚Äôt respond to the second notice, the seller should assume that you are not willing to wait issue a full refund promptly.""Instead of following the correct protocol it appears from the lies I was told and the responses other consumers have been getting that H&M is not compliant with these rules.My items were not delivered in the time promised, they were supposed to be delivered in 12-15 business days and remain in a warehouse 20 business days later. I was not offered a revised shipping date or offered a refund. My money was taken and I was lied to multiple times.**H&M is sneakily getting around this law by having their customer service reps tell customers that the delivery window time frame starts after they create the shipping label, when in fact the time begins once payment is processed and a confirmation email is sent. So I placed my order on 11/22/20 which is when the time clock for delivery starts. They created a label on 12/3/20, 11 days after my order was placed. They're now using 12/3/20 as their start date and to excuse their deplorable lies and deceit. Chat transcript from 12/18/2020Ela: Thank you so much for holding! Upon checking, your package has been shipped out on December 2nd and courier is waiting for the package to arrive since December 3rd.

H&M,Don't mess up your address... don't even order online,"This is my first time ordering from H&M and I am extremely disappointed. I placed my order at 10:20. I immediately realized that I put the wrong address, and tried multiple times to cancel it within the 5 minutes following. The next 25 min were spent on hold, both in chat and on the phone. By the time I was speaking to someone, it was roughly 1050. I explained the issue, and she was also not able to cancel the order, and told me there is a time frame to cancel of 30 min to 1 hour after the order is placed. All of this was done well before an hour after it was placed. I am very disappointed that this didn't get resolved. I understand it was my mistake, but I have never dealt with a company that was unable to change my delivery address, especially SO soon after placing the order. This is ridiculous.",0,1
H&M,Such a shame H&M use Hermes,"Such a shame H&M use Hermes to deliver their parcels and collect returns. I have booked a return 4 times and not one time have Hermes showed up. Hermes tracking is useless and just says ""we tried to collect your parcel but you were not home"". Unlikely given I am home 24/7! Customer services answer? Rebook the return with Hermes. Meanwhile, I will not receive my refund until the items are back with H&M.",0,1

H&M,Never order online with this company,"So I have ordered from H and M three times ever online in my life. All three times were the worst experiences of my life. My first was pre COVID. My order took over a month with no explanation as to why or no tracking number to track it.I do like the product so I decided to order some Christmas presents this year (with in mind that shipping takes a month), I placed two orders in the first week of November of 2020. It is December 17 2020 and I still do not have the packages. The website says that it would take 10-14 business days. It has now taken 29 business days and again I do not have a tracking number to track it.Don't order from here if you want things to come in time. Now I am missing out on three Christmas presents.",0,1

I always get things delivered to my local shop incase I am not home and delivery time is usually within a week. Ordered a scarf and it was delivered in 3 days which I was impressed with. Recently ordered a couple of homeware ornaments and they were really well packaged.,0,5
H&M,I have to condition my mind not to‚Ä¶,"I have to condition my mind not to think about this order, because this is beyond disappointing. Reading the updates for the shipping adds to this feeling. This is beyond snail mail, I don't know what it is. The process of ordering was itself plaqued with inaccuracies, the system adds extra pieces (happens on most of my orders), and then sets you up for a return. I won't accept Covid as an excuse for the lack of disregard of providing customers with items they purchased. I bought from Suzy Shier a day after my order from H&M. I received those items over a week ago, and sent back a few pieces that were large and they confirmed receipt. I purchased from DSW and those items came beginning the following week after my order. So no H&M, there is no valid excuse.I see your sales right now, and I could not be in my right mind to order anything unless I need it for summer next year.I wonder what date you plan to use as you return date starting point?",0,1
H&M,Some positivity for balance,"I think this is one of those companies where people only post a review after a bad experience, so for a bit of balance - I have a positive experience to report. I ordered some shoes online for my son and it turned out they were too small. With all the complications of lockdown I didn't get to the post office to return them within the 28-day window. Contacted H&M online and they said not to worry as they have extended the returns deadline while lockdown is ongoing. Was a big relief and he has the right size of shoe now!",0,5

H&M,Choosing the cheapest courier is bad business,"Same issue as many on here. I have been waiting weeks for a delivery. It left the H&M depot within hours of my order but has been sat in the couriers depot ever since 'waiting to be sorted'. Customer service at the couriers say H&M need to raise a formal complaint but H&M refuse to do so as more time needs to pass. Bought the items as a gift and by the time they arrive I will not be able to use them. This is not a 'COVID' problem or a 'Christmas' problem as they are trying to lead people to believe, as I have ordered many items from other retailers (Next and Zara) and they arrived within days. H&M have obviously gone with the cheapest courier option and the customers are paying the price. I will never order from H&M again and would caution others to think twice before they do too.",0,1

H&M,Ordered about a month ago and the‚Ä¶,"Ordered about a month ago and the package said shipped on Dec 3rd on the H&M website but when the tracking number is placed in the USPS tracking system it said that they have not received the package. H&M just kept saying that it is the carrier's fault but USPS is shipping all my other items from other stores on time. Customer Service seems to be giving the same answer over and over and probably the same answer to every customer. This package was Christmas presents and still hoping it arrives before Christmas but it seems like a very low chance.Also, the people I talked to was name Jennifer, James, and Jess. I got Jess twice already but on different days when I contacted the live chat.",0,1

Items shipped 11/26/20 and reached their shipping partner on 12/1/20 (never accepted by USPS). No updates since. I called CS last week and was told there wasn't anything they could do until today. I called back today and they said there still isn't any movement (no kidding) and they would open an investigation. I'm not hopeful after seeing all the other reviews. This was my first (AND LAST) online order from H&M.,0,1
H&M,I've always loved H&M but these last 2‚Ä¶,"I've always loved H&M but these last 2 orders have me completely done with them.I placed two orders on 11/20 and 11/21 under the impression that it would take 12-15 days to arrive. I understand COVID has massively delayed shipping, so I placed the order thinking there's no way it won't arrive before I go on holiday.It's now 12/15 and the orders haven't even had shipping updates since the 7th! I don't know when or if my packages will ever even arrive and I don't even care anymore. 26 days and counting, and no package arrival or updates in sight.Finally, I contacted them asking if they can compensate for the experience and they refused to even help out at all. I never care enough to write a review but this experience made me feel like a total Karen and I'm forsure deleting my H&M account/shopping elsewhere.",0,1
H&M,Who knew gift cards were so labor intensive?!!,"I ordered a gift card on 12/4, foolishly believing it would be here by Christmas. I just received an email stating it was just mailed today, no tracking, and would take another 10-12 BUSINESS DAYS to arrive! What takes 10 days to put a card in the mail???

I called today and they said it may be here by the 29th of December or by the 1st of January. If I had known this, I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered from them at all. Why is it that every other company I‚Äôve ordered from has delivered my packages in a week or two max but H&M is taking more than a month? When I called customer service, they barely spoke English, and they were not of any help. They read a script and the woman repeated herself over and over. I asked for a manager and she refused to put one on the phone. She didn‚Äôt offer anything for the inconvenience which is standard when they have such delays. Horrible, horrible customer service.",0,1
H&M,Zero stars,"Zero stars. Still waiting on items from last month, tracking says the same thing still in warehouse. Will never order online from H&M again!

By the looks of the reviews dont bother calling into customer service!",0,1
H&M,Updated review 30 days since order was processed.,"Updated review because my items were delivered today, all the items were accounted for and the quality was excellent. My main problem with the order was shipping due to COVID, the parcel company and tracking were frustrating to say the least. Honestly, I was upset with the delay mainly because 12-15 days was the stated delay when the order was placed. I feel if they said ‚ÄúHey, It could be up to two months before you get your stuff!‚Äù I honestly would‚Äôve still ordered the items I received today. Communication is key. Just be upfront and people will understand and plan accordingly.",0,4

H&M,Insufficient address.

I had the same issue with INSUFFICIENT ADDRESS. My order details was correct but I never really got the answer if the mistake was from USPS or H&M. I ordered October 23 and waited a ENTIRE MONTH. I was okay with waiting as long as the order comes but it never did. I wrote them an email and went through their chat. I got two answers: email said they‚Äôre gonna redeliver and chat support said they can‚Äôt redeliver and will just issue a refund (they never issued a refund) so I asked another chat support agent to confirm this and he said they never offered redeliver. So what was that email about? Fake email? And they told me to send that email I got to their back office. The chat agent even made me feel like I was lying about it with ‚Äúif you say so‚Äù ‚Äúif you believe‚Äù. Its like they never really care about online customer service.Save yourself from disappointments and just go to their physical store. Their staff has always been amazing.,0,1

I then informed them that it was fraud to make false claims and guarantees to customers, and they still did not offer a discount or anything. Very upset and will never shop here again. DO NOT BUY, especially around the holiday season.",0,1

I can't do anything until 12/17, which by that time, I will not receive my items before Christmas and the items I ordered may no longer be available. They are also refusing to give me a refund until after the 17th of December. Oh but they did tell me I can go and reorder the items, then return the once that I originally ordered or when the items are marked missing I'll get my money back then. What a joke. So now I'm just fighting with them to get my money back.... Seriously Run! You can get great deals, better product with a reputable merchant.",0,1
H&M,Do not shop online!!!,"The worst store to shop online from by far!!! Ordered a few things for Christmas and after a month of waiting it finally shipped, but of course when they tried to deliver it they said it was an ‚Äúinsufficient address‚Äù, yet H&M told me I in fact had the address correct. Spoke with their customer service and they told me I needed to re order, so I did, because they offered me free shipping and 15% off. We‚Äôre now 2 weeks away from Christmas and the order I had to RE ORDER, has yet to ship!

I was panicking and I messaged H&M straight away and they said they will deal with it and they contacted the delivery company and after 48 hours I reached out to them again asking about what happened to my parcel and they said they will refund me and they refunded me the full amount. This gives me full trust in the company that they value their customers and ensure the transaction is as smooth as possible!,0,5
H&M,Terrible customer service,"Ordered a fairly large order for my children for Christmas. After waiting over a week for it to ship ( they did state on the website that it would take 12 to 15 business days for delivery ) I noticed that my address was off by one digit. I called in to have the address corrected because it had not yet shipped and was told that they were unable to correct the address and unable to cancel it as well. Their only solution is that after the address is deemed undeliverable hopefully it would make it back to them and I would eventually receive a refund. Instead of refunding the money so that I could go into the store and purchase the items. They refuse to cancel, they refuse to update the order, yet they have charged my card for items that still havent shipped, that I wont receive. Will never spend another dime with them.",0,1
H&M,H&M online is terrible,H&M online is terrible around the world. I have had problems with every order I have made online in both France and Canada. Their membership program is a joke. I made $200 worth of purchases in the last month of my membership month and now I'm being told because it takes 30 days for them to issue the discount vouchers that I will not receive any of the vouchers as my points were wiped. What a joke. Other times I've ordered 10 items and everything got cancelled by them because they were out of stock except for like 1 item. Another time they sent me a broken handbag and wouldn't refund me. Another time I got sent a sweater when I ordered underwear. Clearly their are some major issues. Stick to just the retail stores and you might have slightly less of an issue.,0,1

The person on the till scanned the QR code on my return invoice only to turn round and say to me sorry it‚Äôs not picking up the QR code to claim your refund. He proceeded to say i would need to send back the items via the post or receive a gift card both of which were inconvenient and not what I wanted. I explained that I‚Äôm entitled to receive a refund back to the way I paid! I paid via PayPal but I had the card I paid with on PayPal and I explained that. I was told that I could be lying about which card I paid with as they have no proof which card it is! Excuse me but here‚Äôs me thinking that I‚Äôm the customer who‚Äôs owed a refund why am I being accused of lieing?!! I even said I‚Äôd log on to my PayPal account and they will see the card! Then I got told that they can‚Äôt refund it back to my card as it could be classed as fraudulent! So not only am I being accused of being a liar but a fraudster too!! Absolutely shocking service! Why should the customer have the inconvenience of having to return their items because your technology fails!!!?? This is not the customers fault! To add even more insult to injury I asked to speak to the manager who wasn‚Äôt available so a departmental manager comes over and had a smirk on his face finding the whole situation very amusing it seemed. I am a plus member and after this experience I will be thinking twice before making any future purchases at your store! It really is no wonder people are preferring to shop online when they receive service like this face to face you can hardly blame them!! Judging by all the negative reviews it seems I‚Äôm not the only unhappy customer!!,0,1
H&M,Very poor customer service systems,I recieved my order with the most expensive item missing from it. Followed the link from the customer service email I recieved after my order. That directed me to a chatbot. After a long wait chatted to a rep. Couldn't find my account details and eventually asked me my address and said that it couldn't be accessed as it was an irish order. Gave me the 'irish' customer service phone number which is the english number. Rang that. Got through to a very distant customer service rep who took my order number and my name and left me in silence for almost 10 minutes. At that point I couldn't get a reply so I hung up. I total I wasted an hour of my time trying to sort out what should have been a straightforward issue with no resolution. I've sent a message but not expecting a reply any time soon and I definitely won't have the item for when I needed it (two weeks post the order date). Terrible customer service systems in place.

H&M,Horrible Shipping Delays,"I would not recommend purchasing anything online from H&M. They claim their shipping is delayed due to the pandemic, but I found this quite odd, as I had placed several orders during the summer which all arrived within a few days. While checking my shipment tracking information ( to see my package still sitting in the same facility for a week ) I noticed that despite it being a USPS tracking number and H&M claiming it would be shipped via USPS, my package is actually in the hands of some shipping company I've never heard of called Pitney Bowes. I believe H&M is using the pandemic as an excuse to cheap out on shipping and save a few bucks, which is really scummy.",0,1
H&M,I am currently at 31 days for shipping‚Ä¶,I am currently at 31 days for shipping on an order that I have patiently waited for even with the understanding of Covid reduction. I think that H&M should change their policy standard online to accurately reflect the fact that if ordered even before the holiday they won't be receiving packages in time for the Holidays.,0,1
H&M,Amazing experience,I don‚Äôt understand why H&M received such bad reviews. I have been shopping with H&M for a couple of years and had no problems. It‚Äôs helpful to be a member to collect points (although not much in ¬£) and get free delivery. I love the ethical part of H&M which is garment recycling! This is environmentally friendly and made my shopping more consciously.Deliveries are fast with me so far. Clothes quality is amazing! I‚Äôm a big fan of the Basic line. H&M is just profession in fabrics. Also I have had many true bargains with their sales. Truly amazing quality and affordable price.,0,5

I always shopped in stationary shops but this time, due to the lockdown, I thought give an online shopping a go. Worst decision of 2020. I Ordered with H&M in the mid of October 2020. It arrived late (waited 14 days). It was a big order for the whole family, nearly¬£250 spent.I returned half of it on 5th of November( due to wrong items sent, wrong sizes sent or to large or small).Since then, I contacted, the their service regarding the missing refund exactly 27 TIMES!!! This is simply unbelievable in XXI century! I never ever had an issue like this, with any online retailer. Firstly, their excuse was: parcel got lost, we need to wait, then:we will issue the refund - manually, please provide card details,then:we cannot refund you to PayPal because you opened a case, so you need to close the case-so I did. Next,as I still had no money back, I contacted them AGAIN to quarry. Within the next 4weeks I was asked 5 times on the chat, in the emails and over the phone to provide bank details again and again. So I did, every time they asked and. I NEVER recived a refund of returned goods worth ¬£100.I am so frustrated,I really want to cry, as despite opening internal case and speaking to them NUMEROUS of times, each person I spoke to, behaved like there was no problem. Each time I had to explain in details what happened because they had no records. Yes, no records! no trace of me contacting them to complaint 27times. Couldn't find the complaint case that THEY opened themselves !each time I was promised to get a refund and to wait 3-5 days for it to clear. Nothing happened. It makes me feel ü§Æ. So each time I called, wrote, chat, they had no clue ,really wasn't bothered about it and lied non stop. Nothing on records that I was calling, reporting and complaining every other day since the beginning of November. I ALWAYS was asking them to put my requests on the same file. Never did. I am about to raise my complain with Ombundsman now, as I completely lost confidence it could be resolved with them. Nerves WRECKED!And what's more, after first wash, 3/4 of the clothes already looks like rags( the colours run, their cotton feels like poly, shrinks in wash.. ) DISASTER! AVOID! Really not worth it! Fraudsters!",0,1
H&M,Sent wrong item in smaller size‚Ä¶,Sent wrong item in smaller size (ordered outfit and was sent a pack of 5 vests). Apparently it was because the item id ordered was out of stock. To get a refund I had to go to post office to return and wait another 14 days for it. Why couldn't they just cancel the order rather than fob me off with something random?,0,1
H&M,BEWARE they will steal your money,"Placed an order on their website on October 13, 2020. Their website states that delivery time is an estimated 12-15 days. It is now December 6, 2020 - almost TWO MONTHS now since my order was placed - and still no updates on the whereabouts of my order. On top of this, they successfully charged my card TWICE for the same order which was confirmed by my banking provider. I reached out to their customer service multiple times through email about my frustration concerning the overcharge and delayed delivery and each time they were extremely apathetic and useless. I am still waiting for them to refund me the stolen amount and to resolve the issue. I will never be ordering from them again and you should think twice before you do.",0,1

Then literally after a month (a few days ago), I was told that the address was incomplete so everything was returned to the sender. This is ridiculous, I doubled checked that I left the correct address when placing the order in their website. My other same-day purchases at hollister and uniqlo arrived weeks before HM. Then I contacted the online-chat agent about the refund, they were very rude about the situation without any apologies. This is my last time buying from HM.",0,1

H&M,AVOID H&M,Placed an order over three weeks ago and it has yet to be processed. This really reminded me why I haven't shopped with this brand in over a year. Pure GARBAGE!!!

H&M,H&M and Pitney Bowes Shipping isn't 12 its 20 Days,"H&M is definitely experiencing shipping problems with their partner Pitney Bowes. My thought is if you take a crappy system and overload it, you get a shipper that is weeks behind and can't catch up. I ordered from H&M in late September for some winter clothing basics as I have moved from AZ back to the Midwest. I watched the shipping times change from 7-10 days out to what they claim is 12-14. That is the date the shipping label is being created - meaning they are 2 weeks behind in even staging the product for shipping. It will take another week for that label to actually match up to a box and the product to be shipped. Wherever this Pitney Bowes shipping facility is, in Greenwood Indiana - they are playing games with how long the wait is. H&M also has an antiquated computer and ordering system - and I am sure there is some part of the problem coming from the corporation as well. My first order before holiday shopping debacles took over a month to receive. I put another order in 11/15/2020 -here are the stats:Order Placed: 11/15/2020Shipping label created and email that my item has Shipped: 11/25/2020 - 10 DaysGreenwood IN: USPS Reports Still Awaiting Item: 11/28/2020Carol Stream Distribution Center expecting item: 12/2/2020Finally arriving in my state Distribution Center: 12/5/2020Still have not received the item on 12/5/2020: 15 Weekdays - 21 Total DaysJust admit it PITNEY BOWES your in the WEEDS and Need Help because this is actually a 18-20 day wait before it actually does ship (maybe even longer after Black Friday sales). In this day and age - what a shame that you can't keep up with your shipping commitments. It's enough to destroy a retailer. Heres what I think is going on:H&M is selling items that do not actually have in stockORPitney Bowes distribution center can not handle the workload they committed toOR USPS is running way behind.Maybe its a combination of all 3 ... my guess is Pitney Bowes is the culprit.My suggestion look at DICK'S Sporting Goods store - I ordered from them on Thanksgiving Thursday morning and received all my items with free shipping by Saturday - 2 days later INCLUDING a Holiday. Get your crap together H&M.",0,1
H&M,Shipping delays are INSANE,"Ordered items on 11/7, no update until 11/25 showing my items shipped, but the USPS tracking says it‚Äôs still on the way to USPS with no update on delivery. It is now 11/30... hoping it comes before Christmas.",0,1
H&M,Would NOT recommend,Would NOT recommend. The online and store internal communications are extremely poor. After spending ALOT of money with them i simply called to get my birthday 25% off coupon because I noticed I never received. I was told they would notate it on my account and once I got to a store I would just have to call back for them to give approval to the associate to use. Once I drove ALL THE WAY to the store I called back and the representative told me I could only use it online. At the point it‚Äôs not about the money but my time and extremely poor service. The clothes are okay and not even worth the money half the time but it‚Äôs been an easy shop in the past but this experience has blown my trust. There internal communication system is trash.,0,1
H&M,Don't expect to receive your items.,"So like everyone else having problems with getting their orders. I get there's a pandemic going on but I've been waiting nearly 3 weeks for my order, but there isn't an excuse.

HnM service said they were sorry and asked me to order again. Ordered again. This time Post NL delivery says its delivered but I haven't received anything yet. If you order anything from HnM, make sure you use Klarna because atleast you wouldn't have paid and won't have to work on getting your money back if they screw it up. Having said that, the HnM in-store experience is great. Their delivery experience and customer support for it is at the other end of the spectrum unfortunately.",0,1

H&M,Just awful shipping and customer support,"Just awful, I ordered about $40 of clothes and two weeks go by. At the time they said orders would be shipped in up to 11 days, so my order was already late. TWO MORE weeks go by and still nothing. I called customer service twice during that time and they were unhelpful. Apparently, they shipped my item but because of an IT error they didn't get my apartment # so it has to be returned to sender. That was H&M's fault but they won't give me a refund. They even said they can't give me a new delivery date at the moment. In a few days I can make a claim to get a refund and it will be determined by them if I can get one, so it's not even guaranteed. Ridiculous. I will never shop there again, they don't care about their customers or take responsibility. Avoid shopping at H&M, especially online.",0,1
H&M,I will NEVER make another purchase‚Ä¶,"I will NEVER make another purchase here. It took over a month to receive my order. When I reached out to customer service to see what the delay was, they were flippant and unhelpful. When I finally received my order, my most expensive item, a wool cardigan, was missing.

But the fact I ordered something and find out 2 weeks later their ""system"" had an inventory problem that one of the items had been sold out was a tad absurd, I ordered early to ensure enough time for shipment and before the Xmas rush came into play. Than my order gets shipped with Purolator and randomly gets sent to Canada Post. Now my parcel has been sitting in Ontario for 6 going on 7 days with no movement and no one can do anything about it til the ""expected delivery"" day come's and go's. They have terrible customer service and take no responsibility for anything. First and last time shopping here for gifts. Your better off shopping at another store.

Customer service is terrible and they can‚Äôt even explain to me the issue and at first I was told to wait until a Specific date foe a refund and when I called back that day they told me to call back in 2 more weeks to ask for the refund.The whole operation is fishy and I hope they go out of business ASAP.,0,1

H&M,H&M ripped me off,"Wish I could give a 0-star review for this clownery. First of all, H&M overcharged me for an order and I only found this out after checking my credit card statement. I called them about the $18 overcharge a couple of weeks ago and only got the refund last week. If I hadn't checked, I would've been scammed of $18. Second, I don't know what happened to my package but it went from being processed near my location in Mississauga all the way to Saskatchewan! I was supposed the receive the package last week but now the item is delayed. Frankly, it does not make any sense why my package traveled 2000 km across the country for no reason. I double-checked my input address and everything looks fine. Lastly, it's been 21 days since I have made the order, which is ridiculous because the site states 12-16 days for the item to be delivered. Now that my order is in Saskatoon, I don't know when I'll get it. The pandemic can't be used as an excuse because I have ordered from Sephora, Zara, and some international brands from Japan and Korea which took a fraction of this time to arrive. Truly disgusted.",0,1

H&M,So disappointed with H & M Shipping,So disappointed with H & M. The website stated that packages will take 12 - 15 business days. I called to verify that it would be here within that time frame and was told yes. Well that isn't the case. Now I'm being told that my package estimated delivery date is November 30 - December 4 almost a week after initially stated. I wish H & M would have given me the option to ship it faster. I'm also having problems accurately tracking my package because from my understanding they go through a third party company called Pitney Bowes which in my opinion complicates things because when I have tracking questions I'm only given general answers to my specific tracking questions and don't have the option to pick up instead.WORD OF ADVICE: H & M update your estimated shipping times to accurately reflect 3 weeks or longer instead of 2 weeks this helps the customer make a more informed decision on to buy or not.,0,1

I recently sent my best friend in a different state some maternity clothes. I had forgotten to delete her address off my profile. (Which really shouldn‚Äôt have mattered, as my address was set to be the default address In my profile.) anyway, I immediately called customer service. They could not cancel the order. They could not modify the shipping address. The could not refund me. They could not do jack üí© for me. What do their customer service employees get paid to do? I spoke to about 3 different customer service people. They each told me TO HAVE MY FRIEND SEND ME THE PACKAGE WHEN SHE RECEIVES IT. THESE ARE CHRISTMAS CLOTHES. PACKAGES ARE ALREADY TAKING WEEKS AND WEEKS TO SHIP OUT. BY THE WAY THE ITEMS I PURCHASED WERE CHRISTMAS SWEATERS. H&M, step up your customer service if you want to keep customers, especially during a time when lots of people are choosing to shop online for the sake of social distancing.

On Oct. 23rd I finally received an email that my order had shipped (17 business days later!! that is over 3 weeks later!). I checked the tracking number constantly to find out when to expect my clothes to be delivered, except the tracking number kept saying the same thing: ""Label Created, UPS awaiting item"", it said that for an entire 2 weeks. What this really means is it did not ship at all, H&M just created a shipping label and it actually has not really left their warehouse. I contacted customer service on Nov 3rd and I was told to wait an additional 2 weeks for my order to arrive. I eventually got fed up and called my credit card to dispute the charge, and my credit card got my money back for me. H&M then cancelled my order the same day. I placed an order with a different clothing company and received my order from them 2 days later. If you dare order from H&M, expect to wait 2 months for your order, and if at all possible, use a credit card instead of a debit card or PayPal!

I was refunded the money to PayPal however my sum of over ¬£20 was still outstanding a month later. I normally receive an email from them providing details of gift card and balance but never received this. So I then went to call them on on Thursday 19th November, the first time I called I explained the issue, it got disconnected, second time same scenario, third time it was fine. However at this point you can understand my frustration. With one of the colleagues I was told to check gift card ending in **** however it returned a nil balance, as well as being made to check all other gift cards. I further tried explaining to the customer service representative that I never received an email for the remainder of the gift card. The third lady I spoke to was adamant that I had received it, and kept quoting the gift card number which had 0 balance and asked if I had shopped after to which I said they'd be able to see that on the online system if I had. Furthermore, she stated she was able to see a balance, but at the same time I also checked this and this was negative so not quite sure what she was viewing. She then said I would receive an email from the support team.. ALAS I received an email a short while later and guess what...

Ask them to refund and have package returned to them. They say we are not eligible for a refund until 21 days (11/29) after shipping (this is almost two months after placing the order). That tells me they expect it to take 3 weeks to get to us :-( before they will refund. 1st and last order with this company.",0,1
H&M,Terrible,"Unbelievably slow shipping. Said 11-15 days originally and it had been almost 1 month. Took two weeks for them to ""ship"" my order and once they emailed me saying it has shipping it hasn't left the facility for 9 days. Basically they lied about shipping it but probably thought they should act like they did. DO NOT order online from here unless you want to wait over a month for your order.",0,1

H&M,Waiting 25 business days and counting,"Ordered Oct. 12. Notified that delivery would take 12-16 business days because of delays. It is Nov. 15, 25 business days have passed, and I have not received my order. I received a $5 reward for the shipping delay. I also ordered near the beginning of the pandemic and had a similar shipping timeline and my order was also sent back to the warehouse without explanation. I had to place my order again. Most of the items had sold out when I found out my order was sent back, and the H&M rep I contacted could not offer me the same things.To compare with another brand, I ordered an item from Urban Outfitters, which was shipped from the US on Oct. 19 and received it by Nov. 4. I also ordered from a different place that ships from China on Oct. 14 and have received my items. I agree with others that H&M should figure out a better way to handle shipping. I understand that there are delays due to the pandemic, but other organizations have figured it out, and, without transparency from H&M, we do not have explanations for the shipping delays. It isn't very reassuring for holiday shopping either.",0,1
H&M,Don't shop online here...,The absolute worst delivery and customer service experience. They say we should expect delivery delays up to 11-15 business days. That's an understatement. I placed my order almost a month ago and it still hasn't arrived. Don't even bother ordering online from this company. They are absolutely terrible. Ordered from other clothing stores recently and it took them literally at most a week and a half to deliver.,0,1
H&M,Literally the worst delivery‚Ä¶,"Literally the worst delivery experience. They claim a delivery delay of up to 11-15 business days, but it goes well over that. It's been well over 20 days since I placed my order and it still hasn't arrived. I order from places like Banana Republic, Macys, Zumiez, etc., and it'll take them at most a week or a week and half to deliver. The package tracking takes literally almost a week to update.",0,1
H&M,"Socks, dude","I've waited MONTHS for a top to come back in stock. I finally see it back and order it along with other items and after WEEKS I finally get my order. BROOOO they sent me socks...freaking socks. I could never get an agent on the phone, and when I dialed I got hung up on twice by the line because too busy to take my call. I wait 30 minutes to chat with an agent only for her to be like, ""yeah you have to return the socks for us to refund your money for the shirt."" WHAT THE HELL. so now I don't even get the shirt I've waited so long for and have to take it upon myself to return the socks they mistakenly sent me to get my money back.",0,1
H&M,‚ÄúFailed delivery attempt‚Äù lie,Waited almost a month to get my order. I called to verify it would be delivered soon and was assured it would be. It‚Äôs a week later and I still haven‚Äôt gotten it because of a ‚Äúfailed delivery attempt‚Äù that occurred on a day that I was home all day. There was no delivery attempt. Now I have to call customer service again because I have no idea if i will get my order at all at this point.,0,1
H&M,Long delivery wait,"Wow, it's shocking how many bad reviews for H&M. I really don't have bad experiences with them, and I have few orders monthly. The only thing that annoys me is long delivery. 6-8days is way to long for the company size as theirs. But other than that genuinely satisfied.",0,4

H&M,In stock! Out of stock!,"I hardly write negative reviews as I understand that things happen and as long as they get fixed I‚Äôm good. H&M on the other hand is sort of a crap shoot right now. While I get that they are having difficulty shipping in a timely manner due to covid, even though most large companies don‚Äôt seem to be sharing this same difficulty, I‚Äôm a little confused with my current situation. First of all the website will not let you see your orders which is very annoying. I haven‚Äôt been able to see any of my purchases in a month which I feel is intentional on their part. My biggest gripe is that an item I purchased while in stock finally ships a month later only to be told it‚Äôs now out of stock. That tells me that when making an order, if it doesn‚Äôt ship right away then I will keep hearing a month down the road when it finally ships that it will be out of stock if it was popular. If I order it while in stock then it needs to be in stock when it goes to ship forever later. I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered the rest or the pieces for the outfit if it was out of stock. Super annoying and bad business. Do better h&m!",0,1

H&M,Horrible Online Shopping Experience,"Won't be shopping online from H&M ever again. Made 2 orders early October, took a month to finally ship. This was understandable given the Covid pandemic, I don't mind the wait and can be patient. However once my product arrived both orders had issues. My first order that was supposed to be include 2 pairs of biker shorts (as listed on the site as a bundle), only included one. My second order was the WRONG dress, looks nothing like what I had ordered online. I hope I can still get a refund, but given the poor reviews here online I am not optimistic. I have been shopping from H&M in store for a long time so this was an incredibly disappointing experience.",0,1
H&M,EFFFFFF THIS,"I ordered at the beginning of October, finally by the end of October I received an email with ""tracking info"" that just said my items were ""in transit"". One of the items was cancelled, with no explanation (and was still in stock on the website...). No details as to where they actually are along the way, when to expect them, and now it's mid November and there's no sign of my delivery. They said 12-16 business days, it's been 26 business days. Am I getting my winter clothes? Who knows.",0,1
H&M,Take Money. No Item. No Refund.,"It's been complete hell dealing with this piece of s**t company. I purchased an item on Oct 22nd, money was taken out of my account. I decided I did not want the item less than 12 hours later. Called in and wanted to cancel the order. They told me I cannot cancel the order even though I just made the order less than 12hr ago. Come a few days later, the amount was refunded back into my account. Then a few days later on Nov 3rd, they overdraft my account and took the money back out. Here am I today calling in for the 7th times (since their agents just freely hang up on people) to have them issue a refund for an item I have never received. The conclusion was I have to wait another 21 days before I get issued a refund for an item I never got. This place needs to run into the ground.",0,1
H&M,Poor inventory management,"Customer service is none existent at this point and inventory is very poorly managed, everything is out of stock and when they are finally back it is out of stock again the next day.. Shipping times are ridicolously long (over a week).

H&M,Frustrating Experience,I waited almost month to receive my order and yet I did not receive it since they did not include my apartment number in the address.

I received my order and everything was in place I have some items that I will be returning because they do not fit properly and this was because I selected a size bigger than I should have.

I emailed and they never responded but issued a ups tracking number but never took to ups. The order before took two months for maternity clothes- two months for a limited time to wear is nuts but I still thought they would get their act together. Very deceiving and really could care less if you ever get your order- if you don‚Äôt complain it will never come and you will never get money back. They are commuting mail fraud!!!!!,0,1

H&M,Terrible shipping times and mixed messages from staff when I inquired,"Terrible shipping times. I understand most companies are having to compensate for the pandemic and safety of their workers; which I completely support. However, EVERY other company has figured out a way to compensate for increased sanitation and safety. I wait 6 weeks for an order placed in September. Totally unacceptable as far as I am concerned. Especially because when I placed the order it CLEARLY stated shipping times would be 2 weeks. If I knew it would have been 6 weeks, I would not have placed the order. Also, I had to return items that did not fit, and it only took 4 days for my package to get back to the H&M warehouse. It's been 5 days since my package arrived at their warehouse and I emailed them to ask about my refund, and they just told me it would be about 14 business days!

Also, customer service reps hung up the phone twice.",0,1
H&M,As expected,Ordered a large quantity of clothes for my daughter as she is about to be into the next size for clothes. Loads of options available and I love the conscious range.

H&M,Bad quality and sizes,Placed and order with H&M online for the first time and I can safely say it will be the last time. The clothing sizes for the company are absolutely ridiculous how can you buy two items in the same size and one fits but one doesn‚Äôt? That brings me onto the quality of the clothing. I paid more then I would in places like primark so expected better quality but instead I received worse quality. The jeans from here are paper thin. Don‚Äôt recommend H&M and as I am reading neither do a lot of other people.,0,1

I let it slide because it was early stages of covid and shut downs but you would think a big corporation would get their $hit together. The rest of the world has adapted. This will for sure be my last order. Also, the purposely don‚Äôt allow you to look at your previous purchases to track orders. I attempted to track my order by clicking on my purchase order and it no longer shows you it. Ridiculous! I forgot what I ordered. I hope it fits since it‚Äôs taking this long to receive it.

Received an order confirmation email and then nothing. My payment hasn't even been processed yet. Repeated calls to the customer service centre (what a joke that is, H & M don't know what it means) has been a complete waste of time. I know it's not the fault of the staff there, but they can't even tell me when the order will be shipped or the payment processed. All I have been told is it will be delivered on 12th November, which is impossible due to covid shipping delays from Sydney to Perth. Joke of the day yesterday, I got sent a 10% discount voucher FROM SWEDEN for my next order! Maybe my current order might arrive in time for Christmas NEXT year? Very very sorry I ordered from H & M, never again, the lack of service is appalling.",0,1
H&M,Bad Experience,"I placed my order on Oct 13 and I patiently waited for the 16 business days that was stated on the website for my order to be delivered, which was Nov 4. My order has not shown up yet. I got an email with the tracking number for Canada Post but the shipment has not even reached Canada Post yet and the only update was ""Electronic information has been submitted by shipper"". I contacted H&M customer service and as many people have mentioned before, you don't really get help from them. The customer service agent I dealt with was rude and unapologetic. I was told my order was coming in from the US and it may be delayed because of customs in which this information is not disclosed on the website. I told the agent I understood that this wasn't his fault, but this information needs to be disclosed to customers upfront and he should forward this information to management. He told me the expected delivery date is Nov 9 (which I highly doubt it will be), but it could take longer and that if I don't see it by Nov 20, to contact customer service. This would be 1 month and 1 week after I placed my order. It should not take that long for an order to arrive. When I expressed my frustrations, he was unapologetic and not understanding at all.

They also told me they cannot cancel it EVEN THOUGH THE ORDER HASN'T PROCESSED. Then they put me on hold for over 30 minutes. I've moved a lot, and this has happened before, with an old address. I have NEVER had a retailer tell me they couldn't make an address change, or at least cancel, and order that hasn't even processed. Give me a break! Putting me on hold for 30+ minutes to not even help me was also poor. Apparently, h and m can take 10-15 days (or longer) to process your order and they just expect you to be understanding but if YOU need something, they have zero ability to help you. I'll stick with Nordstrom, DSW, Ulta, and all the other retailers that had zero problem changing an address for something that hasn't even processed.

Contacted customer service multiple times but they just told me it‚Äôs in-transit when the last update they have from the courier is from 7th October. I have never encountered such inefficient customer service before. I don‚Äôt know when will I even get my order as none of the reviews actually state if they had received their orders or not. I‚Äôm asking a refund for both orders.,0,1
H&M,Shop at your own risk!!!!,"Firstly it take about 13 BUSINESS DAYS sometimes a couple of days more for you to receive the package. More often than not there are some items missing upon receiving package, but you are still charged for everything! Then most of the time the items are out of stock by the time the incompetent H&M warehouse and shipping department get to your order! Customer service chat does end up refunding you, but It takes about 5-10 BUISNESS DAYS to see it in your bank account. It‚Äôs upsetting bc a lot of times you don‚Äôt when or IF you‚Äôll receive your complete order! THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE BEFORE COVID!! SO IF THEY USE COVID AS AN EXCUSE DO NOT BELIEVE H&M!",0,1
H&M,I ordered 5 pairs of trousers online,"I ordered 5 pairs of trousers online. Never received items after 3.5 weeks. Customer service a disgrace. It took 7 days to actually despatch the order with Hermes and I was eventually given a tracking number.I regularly tracked my order but it kept saying it was still in the Hermes warehouse. After waiting and waiting and waiting I contacted H & M via their chat box as their website said their phone lines were experiencing high volume of calls.I put my order number in the chat box. It told me my order had been dispatched. End of. No further assistance, so I rang customer services, after being stuck in a queue for absolutely ages, my frustration really started to take hold.Eventually my call got answered. It was a lady from a call centre that had difficulty speaking English.I gave her my order number and she said the parcel had been returned to the warehouse undelivered. She couldn't explain why. I said why cant you tell me what happened to my order? She said you have received a refund. I said no i haven't I would have known if i had. I told her I didn't want a refund, I would my trousers. She just kept talking over me with her pre written script. There was no apology, no offer of resending out a duplicate order. All she kept saying was you've received a refund. My husband checked we had not received one at that time. Her attitude was very dismissive and rude and towards the end of the call I told her to stop talking over me and to show me some customer service and tell me why after 3.5 weeks I had no order. I said surely Hermes would have some kind of returns code. I never have issues with deliveries. She just kept reading her script regarding the refund. Before I actually gave her a peace of my mind I hung up on her. Utter disgrace to treat a customer like that. Ive shopped with H and M for of 32 years. I don't know whose fault it was that the delivery didn't take place, it was probably Hermes. However its still an order with H and M. They should take responsibility. I did get a refund 2 hrs later. I have placed another order as I really love their trousers. This time I am getting them delivered to a local shop. I order the trousers on the 27th October and they still haven't been despatched yet but they say 6-8 days. Not great. Is it any wonder that these stores are going under in the current climate. Customer service is key, without customers, you have no business. They should look into how Amazon achieve their amazing deliveries.",0,1
H&M,I like the clothes but will definitely‚Ä¶,"I like the clothes but will definitely shop elsewhere. Shipping should not take this long. I would rather pay a higher price to a company with faster shipping. I‚Äôve had items shipped at least three times this year and each time it took over three weeks.

H&M,I dont know what the hell they are‚Ä¶,"I dont know what the hell they are doing, ordered 11.10 and on the website saying delivered 22.10 but now it is 30.10 I have nothing. Called them several times just did not come out with any solution. Please never ever trust this disgusting company!",0,1
H&M,The order that will never arrive...,"Ordered on Oct 3rd 2020, still have not received my item. Contacted support 4 times to get information, received none. Received a canada post tracking number last thursday, the estimated delivery has said '1-11 business days' all week. I'm so disappointed, this company is greedy, driving sales with mediocre promotions to their site, but they're unable to fulfill these orders properly. I can't believe they haven't figured out ecommerce fulfilling yet. Not ordering from H&M again.",0,1
H&M,"Website doesn't work, can't ammend order without cancelling it.",Website doesn't work properly. When I put my address in it deletes the first line (number and house name) and repeats the street name twice. After speaking to customer service was told they couldn't ammend the address and the whole order needed to be cancelled which I begrudgingly agreed to. If you can't even test your shopping application before deploying I have very little faith in the rest of your company and will shop elsewhere in future.,0,1
H&M,Worst Shipping Services I've Experienced...,"H&M have the worst customer service and shipping services. The customer service representatives are not helpful. There shipping services are a freaking joke. I placed an order on 10/12 and to this day, the 30th, the order has not left the warehouse yet. So frustrating! H&M keeps sending out coupons everyday but they really need to take a step back and put some attention on online orders being delivered within the time frame they promised. Steer clear of ordering online from them!",0,1
H&M,They got their stuff together,I found these reviews only after i had placed my order and its fair to say i was not expecting anything but disappointment BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY‚ÄôVE FINALLY GOT A HANDLE ON THINGS - placed my order sunday and got my order on friday morning so very happy with the service. i emailed customer service after reading the reviews and they contacted me next morning telling me my package would arrive exactly when it did.

H&M,Horrible first time experience,"Horrible first time experience. It's been 10 days since placing order. Just went on line to use their live chat to check on status and I'm #32 in the que.Website says shipping is slower because of Covid, but this is just a bad company.

H&M,One star because customer service was‚Ä¶,"One star because customer service was good. Other than that the shipping has been delayed by more than 14 days, although it says in their website, delayed 11 days. I called many times to cancel the order and they wouldn‚Äôt. And they keep saying it is getting ready to ship but nothing. I understand it‚Äôs COVID but at the same time all the other stores have faster shipping. Never again will I order. It will be a month soon and I still have nothing . This is ridiculous. H&M you lost a loyal customer",0,1
H&M,Shipping delays and horrible customer‚Ä¶,"Shipping delays and horrible customer service. My item took 22 days to ship, I could not cancel or receive a refund. The promised estimated time with the shipping delay was 11 days. They should not accept online orders if they cannot fulfill reasonable shipping times. Terrible when people need items in a certain time. I have had no other issues with any other merchant I have ordered from.",0,1

I put in an order for $200 worth of clothes and found this website shortly after and got worried because of all the horrible reviews. I ordered on October 4 and it just came in today. They give you such a short window too to cancel your order! I don‚Äôt understand why they take so long to ship it out because my tracking page said my order was processed for like two whole weeks lol. The best way to get ahold of them is to just contact them through instagram, even then they aren‚Äôt that helpful. They don‚Äôt even update the tracking page either soooooooo I‚Äôll never be purchasing from H&M online again",0,2
H&M,Worst EVER,"Worst EVER! I moved (out of state), changed my address online but they still sent it to my old address. I caught it a day after I purchased $350 worth of clothes.

H&M,EXTREMELY slow shipping,"I ordered some clothes on October 2nd and I did not get a shipping confirmation until October 20th. It‚Äôs been 6 days since I got that email and their ‚Äútrack&trace‚Äù website still says the same thing and has not updated since. I also ordered from hollister the same day and it arrived the following Monday so it has nothing to do with the mail carrier being slower than usual as well. I feel like my package possibly hasn‚Äôt even shipped yet! I knew it was going to be slow since they have it plastered all over website that all orders will take 12-16 business to be delivered, but I did not think it was going to take this long.",0,1

H&M,15 business days since order and still not shipped,"Ordered Oct 6 and still have yet to receive a shipping confirmation email. I believe my order status is still ‚Äúin progress‚Äù. I honestly don‚Äôt understand why there is such a delay in shipment-lack of manpower? Items low or out of stock?I‚Äôve ordered from plenty of stores online ie Old Navy, Gap, CJLA and shipping has been prompt...1-2days to ship. This has been a terrible experience so I definitely don‚Äôt plan on ordering online from H&M ever again.",0,2
H&M,1 ‚≠êÔ∏è to H&M online purchases,The reason I‚Äôm giving one star to H&M is its long and delayed delivery process. According to the company the expected delivery time to my physical location is between 2-7 working days. It has been more than 10 working days and I haven‚Äôt yet received my parcel. It is better to visit your nearest store in order to do your shopping and avoid online purchases.,0,1
H&M,Cancelled order by H&M‚Ä¶,Ordered item on 16/10 and on 23/10 H&M cancelled my order with an untrue standard explanation about trying to deliver 3 times. I will not order from H&M again. Huge queue to speak to a customer service person on line. I do not trust this company anymore,0,1

H&M,What to expect when purchasing from H&M right now.,"I, like so many others, recently ordered some things. So here is the rundown on what to expect. I would recommend placing your order on a Sunday or Monday. After 11 *business days* it should be ready to ship out which could take as long as 21 days/15 business days to arrive.After seeing that my order was taking ages, I used the chat function on their website to talk with a customer service representative. She was very helpful and gave me the following information: At this time, the warehouse is working on orders from September 29-Oct 4. If you ordered in this time frame, your package should ship momentarily! And after that will be another batch, etc. I will admit, I wish I they made it clearer that it would take over a month for things to arrive. But that is the warehouse's fault, not the customer service and sales representatives, so please be kind to them! They are probably getting thousands of calls from frustrated people and are getting overwhelmed. Shout out to Yessica for helping me out so much.",0,3
H&M,If I could give zero stars I would,"If I could give zero stars I would. Don‚Äôt listen to the 5 star reviews they are very obviously fake and PR trying to save face. They are very clearly going out of business since they are taking orders yet not shipping them for weeks or months. I called to cancel my order and get my money back, I got zero help, not even a gesture to provide free shipping when I return the items since I‚Äôm not having my kids wear Halloween outfits in December when I probably will finally receive them. And the supervisor, Johnathon, wouldn‚Äôt let me take the customer service survey and hung up on me. Great job H&M...because you wanted 2020 to look good in the books so you don‚Äôt go bankrupt you‚Äôve lost so many customers.",0,1
H&M,"3rd week, order still not shipped",3 weeks in and my order is still in their warehouse as like so many others who placed reviews here. Probably the very last time I will order from H&M online.,0,1
H&M,Awful experience today at the bluewater‚Ä¶,Awful experience today at the bluewater store. Went in to return a few items from a recent delivery which I had ordered online. Gave my receipt and the items and was told I couldn‚Äôt have a refund because I had used PayPal. I asked where it says that I‚Äôm not allowed to get a refund in store and she told me it doesn‚Äôt. So I said again please can I have a refund. She said it‚Äôs a recent change and they can only refund card payments. So I asked if this was a new policy of theirs or was it a law to which she replied well actually it‚Äôs our system that‚Äôs playing up and not letting them process it today. (So she had lied twice previously telling me it was a recent change) I said well that‚Äôs not really ok as it tells me online that I can bring back in store and also says it on the receipt that you are holding. Was told again nothing she can do. I then asked to speak to a manager and this is where is got 100 times WORSE. A manager (Frankie) with an attitude came over flung the screen round at me and said see it‚Äôs not working......And I said well what can be done then as it‚Äôs my fault it isn‚Äôt working I have made an hour journey to return items which I‚Äôm in my right to do and she said it‚Äôs not my problem.... She didn‚Äôt want to help me from the second she came over. There is no way there was nothing she could do as a manager there had to be an override or a solution to a system error. An error which should have been sorted as the assistant has told me they had been having the problem on and off for a couple of weeks. I have made a complaint to head office Lauren at customer service was very helpful and apologetic and told me that they should never have sent me away without my refund as there is something they could of done. She tried to call the store with no avail and I am currently waiting for a call back to update me on my complaint as I will be taking it all the way.,0,1
H&M,Plan ahead- very slow shipping,I love H&M but lately shipping has been very slow. It's been 17 days and my order just shipped.

I will never order from h&m again, I have always shopped online and have never experienced such slow a delivery process. Also H&M needs to tell customers that it can go over ""12 to 16 days"".

H&M,Never purchase from here!,Don‚Äôt recommend purchasing from this place one bit. I paid through PayPal like I do everything else and somehow H&M pulled up my address from 2 years ago that I removed from my PayPal account. Called right away after placing order to just be told they can‚Äôt change my address and I‚Äôll have to try contacting the shipping carrier to get it delivered to the correct address which I couldn‚Äôt do because H&M requested I can‚Äôt change the delivery address. I called again to see about refund since I can‚Äôt receive it and they told me I had to wait until package was delivered to wrong address and they can issue the refund then so I called back once again after this happened. They are now telling me I have to wait until the 8th of November in order to hear back on whatever they are doing and emailing the carrier to do whatever. This was all pointless and a waste of time and money. I paid over a month ago and they continue to play games and say they can‚Äôt change anything or issue the refund.,0,1
H&M,Your order is most likely going to take at least 15 business days between order and delivery.,"I placed an order September 23rd. Before I ordered, H&M listed a disclaimer on their website stating orders were taking 10-11 business days to process before shipping. My order shipped October 8th and arrived at my house October 13th. While my order did take longer to process than stated, I'm happy with my purchase and received all correct items. I have since ordered online again keeping in mind that I probably will not receive my items until November. I'm not really sure what's going on with H&M, but I do know it appears that Amazon has completely ruined a lot of people expectations for what is an acceptable wait time for processing/delivery.",0,5

Quality is really good too and unlike many other shops I have bought from, with H&M my children tend to grow out of their clothes, rather than wear them out",0,5
H&M,Beautiful cushions!,Ordered 14 cushion covers. Quality and price is fantastic. They look gorgeous and feel far more expensive than what I paid. Delivery was very quick. Definitely worth being a member for discount too.,0,5
H&M,Do not order from them online!!,"This is ridiculous!! I wish I had read the reviews on here before ordering online. I ordered two things online on 9/24. I got several emails saying the order is delayed but it will ship soon. The package finally shipped on 10/11, almost three weeks after I made the order! This is unacceptable! On 10/19, so 11 days after shipping, it is still in transit. I don't know when I will receive my package and honestly I almost have given up on seeing this package being delivered. I don't even know what carrier H&M use and it doesn't say when I go on H&M Track&Trace. I can't even believe this. I've ordered things from other stores online and they are on point with their shipping&handling. I am so pissed about my experience with H&M online, I will never order from them online again. And from seeing other reviews about some items missing, I am also worried about that. Save your money or spend it somewhere's else. I know H&M have affordable items, but the time it takes to get it doesn't even make it worth it.",0,1
H&M,definitely become a member!,there are so many advantages (eg. free delivery)!,0,5
H&M,Steal your money,"Like many others, I waited for about a month for my order to ship only for it to get lost. I requested a refund almost a month ago and still can't get my money back from them. Everytime I call customer service I get the run around and spend about an hour on the phone with them. Every agent gives me a different explanation about what happened to my package and assures me that a refund will be processed within a couple of days and then it isn't. After about a month and a half I still have no clothes and I am out about $200.",0,1
H&M,Their customer service is so bad,Their customer service is so bad. I got so angry on the phone with a representative because I‚Äôm moving out and my order is delayed I tried to cancel it and they won‚Äôt let me. I called again to ask if I could change the delivery address they won‚Äôt let me. It‚Äôs so frustrating. I don‚Äôt know what will happen of my order.,0,1
H&M,Completely unacceptable,I placed my order on 10/3/20 and I just now got an email saying it is being processed. When I clicked the link to see order status it says it in the warehouse! After close to 3 weeks! Don‚Äôt even bother calling customer support either. They are no help. This has been a horrible experience all around. Especially when I read on here that some of the people have been waiting since September! Unacceptable.,0,1
H&M,H&M online orders are wack,"Order‚Äôs been processed since October 2nd and still nothing. Wanted some plaid pants that they didn‚Äôt have in store, so I bought them online. I get an email on Wednesday saying my pants are being prepared to ship. It‚Äôs Saturday and I still have no update saying they have been shipped. Anyone would think an order on 1 PAIR OF PANTS would be shipped after 2 weeks, but guess not with H&M. I then got on customer service and they said it‚Äôd be shipped sometime next week. Then what?? If it‚Äôs taken that long to ship I can‚Äôt imagine what I gotta wait for it to finally arrive.",0,1
H&M,DONT ORDER ONLINE ON H&M !!!,"DONT ORDER ONLINE ON H&M !!!People that reply to emails barely understand what you are saying, clearly an indian call center. Website states 11 days to ship and it‚Äôs been 15 and no one has any idea about when or what lolMy points are not even working but i guess the IT don‚Äôt care enough to fix it.

Very, very annoyed and will not use this company again.Please beware!",0,1
H&M,The sh1ttiest customer service ever!,"I called H&M because i was wondering when this sweatshirt that I really wanted was going to be in stock. I want about 4 minutes the the line finally connected. As soon as I was connected, the sales representative hung up on me! I thought maybe it was by accident so I called again. I waited 10 minutes and had to listen to 10 minutes of their sh1tty music. I finally got connected again and I was asking the question. The person I was talking to seemed nice but then I stumbled on my words and the b1tch hung up on me. Don‚Äôt waste your time calling their customer service because it‚Äôs worse than their NASA hoodies :)",0,1
H&M,Brilliant service H&M and Stephanie!,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews as I couldn't rate H&M highly enough. I had a couple of recent disastrous orders - the first was my own fault (I ordered a package on my online account and it went to a previous address listed). I notified them straight away but it was still delivered 3 days later, and when I got back in touch they refunded it.Then I received the order to the correct address and later returned 2 out of 3 items (great quality but ordered wrong size). However, they don't seem to have received the return yet. I got in touch via the 'send a message' function on the website and within 10 minutes Stephanie from customer service had phoned me to discuss it. She took the details and as it had been over 14 days since I sent them back, within another 5 minutes she had refunded the relevant items. By the time I got off the phone, Stephanie had sent an email confirming this. Not only was she efficient, but incredibly reassuring and personable - she's a credit to the companySome of the best customer service I have received, and I'm sure to keep shopping at H&M in future (and be a bit more careful with my orders)",0,5
H&M,Worst customer service I have ever‚Ä¶,"Worst customer service I have ever dealt with, multiple calls were made. Both ""representatives"" were rude, dismissive and refused to transfer me to anyone that had actual information. Been waiting 3 weeks for an order to even be processed and they REFUSE to refund or cancel the orders because the ""warehouse is currently packing it"" for the last 3 weeks??? Yeah I doubt that. Basically they still $150 from me and have yet to receive items they haven't even left the warehouse.",0,1
H&M,Vote with your feet/clicks - refund money not received after returning to store,Returned items from an online order to store. Cashier processed in front of me and provided me receipt. Online membership account # of points updated to reflect return. Refund money not actually received.Customer service on phone a waste of time - tell me they can do nothing about it on the phone and I need to RETURN TO THE STORE DURING A PANDEMIC TO COMPLAIN ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE rather than dealing with it on the phone. This is despite evidence online that the return was acknowledged by H&M (in my membership account). Have emailed now to explain the same thing to their customer service line. If they cannot fix then will raise dispute with credit card. What a hassle. Buyers beware - it is probably not worth it.,0,1
H&M,Don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs so many‚Ä¶,"Don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs so many bad reviews.I always shopped in-store with H&M but since Covid I‚Äôve gone online. I bought 2 sweats and a trouser. Despite the sweats being the same design and same size, the sizing was different.Didn‚Äôt Like how the trousers fit so I went in-store and returned them. I returned on a Thursday and only showed up in my account on a Sunday but shows it was refunded on the Friday. All in all, happy with my purchases & experiences :)",0,4
H&M,Horrible people,basically sent me the wrong size and item sold out. They told me to put on notifications for stock but usually you can only do that if the item is actually on the site which it no longer was... They don't care about their customers and only offered a 25% off next purchase.,0,1
H&M,Do not order from them,Do not order from them. Shipping is terrible and no customer service response. Never had this bad of customer service. Placed a gift order on September 27th and nothing yet. Now I have no gift. Wish I would have read these other reviews before ordering.,0,1

H&M,Worst store ever,Worst store ever! Wait a whole entire month to process and the clothing are still at the warehouse. Rather shop at old navy. They will ship the product out within a day. I will never shop at H & M again. Imagine shop for Christmas presents. You will probably get the gifts next year! Smh! The customer service and Manager is so rude and unprofessional. There are no cancel button. They basically forcing you to buy it and just wait for months.,0,1
H&M,2020 seems to be a bad year for H&M‚Ä¶,"2020 seems to be a bad year for H&M Online. I have never had issues with them before and I‚Äôve been shopping online with them for 10 years. I know a lot more people are ordering online due to the virus so I‚Äôm not even totally bothered by how long it takes them to fill and ship an order. My issue is that for the last two times, they‚Äôve sent me items I didn‚Äôt order and things I did order weren‚Äôt included. I reluctantly ordered a third time because I‚Äôm doing Christmas shopping early and they have an item I can‚Äôt find elsewhere and I‚Äôm really hoping the item is actually in there. It‚Äôs really frustrating because it‚Äôs always an item I was really excited about that‚Äôs missing, the return takes forever so my refund is delayed and at that point either the item I wanted sold out or I don‚Äôt have the energy to trust them not to mess it up and have to go through this again. I‚Äôm not sure if they can‚Äôt afford to hire more people if it‚Äôs a cost thing, maybe the pandemic has hit their company pretty hard? But at the same time, why can‚Äôt the people who fill the orders actually take time to make sure the orders are filled correctly. Anyways, buyer beware. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be shopping online from them for quite some time. It‚Äôs just not worth it.",0,1
H&M,Do not order ever from H&M,Do not order ever from H&M. Really terrible customer service. I ordered 3 weeks ago and top wont ship. They apologized and told me they would refund shipping charges and never did.

H&M,Shipping is Garbage,"Its been almost 3 weeks and my order is still being processed and instead of actually sending it they spent that time sending me 3 emails apologizing that its late. Don't send me emails that its late, I know that it's late and way overdue. I ordered clothes from a Chinese clothing store it was being delivered across the globe and it took far less time. I ordered a week and a half after the H&M order and it already arrived. Mind you it was free shipping from them too. DO NOT BUY ONLINE UNLESS YOU HAVE AN INSANE AMOUNT OF TIME TO WAIT. I have never had issues until now. Its a good company for clothing but at the moment their shipping situation is a whole mess. In person shopping is a 5/5 usually great employees but online shopping is 0/5",0,2
H&M,Never had a problem until now,"Never had a problem until now. I waited over a week for delivery as there was no option to get it sooner. I ordered 2 coats which totaled over ¬£100. I ordered them in the colour dark beige. They arrived as light grey. Then the customer service advisor told me the item number for the grey coat matched the dark beige coat. When I went back onto the website the dark beige was out of stock and the grey one was new in. So, instead of owning up and saying they're out of stock, they hoped for the best and sent me a different colour. No huns, it doesn't work like that. Absolute joke. I won't be ordering from you again.",0,1
H&M,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,"Please do not order anything from the H&M website! I placed an order a month in advance from the date I needed the items. It still took over three weeks to ship, and then when it finally did ship it was sent back to the carrier two days after. The only thing H&M can offer me is 20% off my next order and free shipping. 20% off and free shipping for me to wait another month for my items? No thank you!",0,1
H&M,Longest Shipping Ever,"H&M has good quality clothes but at a high toll. The prices aren't bad espescially when on sale, but the shipping tim is up to 15 days. I got a text from FedEx saying my package has shipped and is on it's way, yet H&M says it's still being processed.",0,2
H&M,Terrible and Disrespectful,"Shopping at H&M online shop is getting worse. First of all, they do not refresh availability of items, so if you order something, there is a high possibility they will just send you your shipping without all paid items. Second - they claim you will receive your order in 6 to 8 working days which is a straight up lie. Third - their website is terrible. This was my favourite brand for years. I think more than half of my wardrobe is H&M, but I'll think twice now before I buy anything from them. They are just so disrespectful. Why do they have sofort bezahlen, if they are not capable to deliver all ordered AND PAID items???",0,1
H&M,Product can't be bought,"I've been looking at the site every day to see of the dress I wanted was in my size. When it finally was, I tried ordering it, but it said I couldn't add it to my shopping cart. I refreshed multiple times and the product is still available, yet I can't put it in my cart. When I ask for help, they said that the item was probably not in stock. It's been two hours now, the item is still available on the site but I can't put it in my cart. The site, as well as the app, is not up to date with what they have in stock. I really hope they will do better in the future.",0,1
H&M,Appalling customer service,"I placed a large order for 92 items to send out as gifts. The day before I would have expected them to arrive I received an email saying my order had been cancelled.

No communication at all, absolutely terrible customer service, do not order online with H&M!",0,1
H&M,England,England: Had two postal deliveries and returns recently....First refund allocated 2 weeks after post office return.Second just under 2 weeks after post office return.Delivery was free and got massive combined welcome bonus & birthday percentage off of second purchase.

H&M,Poor Customer Service & Even Worse Shipping Times,"Unfortunately, I seem to be having the same issue as many people here. I've placed a total of 3 orders, spanning from September 20 to September 29, with no updates or shipping notifications--despite it being well passed the 11 business days I was told it would be delayed. Considering the size of the company and the amount I and many others have likely spent, it's appalling how poor their shipping and customer service has been. I kid you not, I have made orders for businesses OVERSEAS after my H&M orders and all of them have shipped within 1-3 business days and for many of them, I've already received my package. Some of those orders even got here well ahead of schedule. And due to COVID-19, many of them had additional sanitation measures and yet they still beat H&M to shipping.Honestly, I just wish I had looked up more reviews for H&M's service before ordering since cancellation seems like a hassle, if not impossible. This is my first and certainly last order from H&M.",0,1
H&M,Crap service,Crap service! No words. I placed a large order on October 1 it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and no update! I‚Äôve contacted customer service multiple times and they all give me the same stupid answer. Due to COVID! Seriously? A month to receive my order ?At this my orders from AliExpress are coming quicker! I placed an order with Zara on October 8 and I received it October 12! I‚Äôm honestly appalled. I‚Äôve never had an issue with H&M. I won‚Äôt be ordering from them again anytime soon,1,1
H&M,This is getting ridiculous,"This is getting ridiculous, I have been waiting for my order for 3weeks! I have bought from other stores like Zara & Fashion Nova these last 3weeks and I already got all my clothes. H&M needs to do something about their mediocre shipping service.",0,1

H&M,Lamp for ¬£70. Big disappointment.,Bought floor lamp for nearly ¬£70 and returned straight away. Really nice design but very poorly made. At this price you can expect good quality. Lamp on joining points (leg in three parts) had very visible chips - steel leg coated by black paint. The same on a head - compartment covering bulb. Not even groove and again chips where black coating comes off and reveals really visible stainless steel colour. Big disappointment.,0,1
H&M,I LOVE H&M clothes and i have never‚Ä¶,"I LOVE H&M clothes and i have never ordered online until now due to COVID. There shipping/processing takes FOREVER. Judging by the reviews it takes a good month to receive your items. Definitely would not pay for express shipping and if you need an item or items for a specific event or there is a timeline, i would just go to one of their store or shop elsewhere. I got the free shipping thank goodness. Also, thought maybe the warehouse was in another country...nope about a 3hr drive to their Indiana warehouse (I am In KY). They claim its due to COVID but it appears this has been an issue for awhile. I am not sure if they just don't hire a lot of warehouse staff or what.",0,1

H&M,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. I‚Äôve had an issue with hm shopping in stores a few times now. One occasion I was overcharged about $50 and didn‚Äôt have a chance to realize it until I was checking the receipt at home. Recently, I was sent a discount code through email and it states in fine print that the code can be used in store and online. When I went into the store the employee told me the code expired the day before. Came home and I looked at the email/app and it clearly stated that it was not expired. I could have saved close to $45 on my $175 plus purchase. I called customer service and they literally can do nothing for you. Only advice they have is to go to the store and possibly have someone fix something. What an inconvenience and terrible experience for the customer. Mind you...Who has time to go back and forth all the time when it should have been figured out the first time around?",0,2
H&M,Worst customer service ever....,"H&m has the nicest clothes for my daughter, but the customer service is the pits, I ordered her a coat online, and I am now into the 15th day of not receving my items, I called customer service, and she just told me that it is still coming, but still shows in progress. I told her that I wanted to cancel my order and I can go to the store, she told me that she does not have a cancel option for my order, I told her that I did not understand, she just kept saying that it was coming, I asked to speak with a supervisor and she blew in my ear like I was getting on her nerves.

H&M,Useless customer service and terrible order system.,"Ordered some items online and they have mangled my delivery address so the courier cannot find where I live. I phoned up the customer service and then discovered the operator mangled it some more. It is not hard to sort out putting in addresses for different countries in the correct format on systems as I've done 4 years of it, yet it seems that it is beyond the intelligence of H&M to do this on their systems.",0,1
H&M,UK review,"UK review - Ordered online over a week ago. Just received an email to say my order is delayed but they haven't given me any other information and there's no option to cancel. From reading other reviews, it looks like I'll be waiting for a few more weeks to come! Awful.",0,1
H&M,"Lovely, friendly store manager",I visited the H&M store in The Merryhill Centre West Midlands today. The store manager was so helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and she went out of her way to help me today. I did not manage to get her name but she is doing a fantastic job. It was a pleasure to shop in the store.,0,5
H&M,Sketchy is an understatement,"Like all of you, my order is ""delayed"". When I went to check today, it says my order has been processed on 9/29, and that it is ""in the warehouse"". So here's the sketchy part. How could my order be ""processed"" on 9/29, when I put my order in on 9/30 and got the confirmation email also on 9/30? I know this is the day I ordered, because I had to reset my password that day in which I got an email on 9/30 about that. Also, why did I receive two separate emails on 10/3 and 10/8 stating that my order had not be processed yet? Here's another sketchy part about this all. It states my reward points have been updated to reflect my new ""processed"" order. However, I have 0 (ZERO) reward points. So, what does this all mean? I'm pretty sure NONE of our orders have been ""processed"". H&M is lying and cutting corners to clear their mountainous backlogs and changing the dates to pretend like they have everything under control to their customers. My guess is that they are severely understocked with clothing, but because of the new fall season and the money they can make off of it, they're still pushing ahead and trying to make empty sales to people that they don't currently have the capacity to fulfill.",0,1
H&M,Unhelpful,"I placed an order 2 weeks ago and it hasn‚Äôt shipped. I am going to be out of town for extended time so I wanted to cancel my order or change the address associated with the order. Customer service was unhelpful, not able to cancel the order or change the address, unable to hold the order, unable to coordinate with their shipping carrier. Basically unable to help in any way. I was told that I will have to go through UPS or USPS to figure it out on my own. I asked them which one..?They said I‚Äôll know when it ships. Okay, thanks for nothing. Now my nearly $300 order will be sitting on my front porch and likely be stolen.",0,1
H&M,Nearly 3 weeks with no actual update,Placed my order on September 23. It‚Äôs now October 12. My order has still not shipped but they continue to send me emails about new online deals. If they can‚Äôt fulfill existing orders they should stop conning people into placing new ones. There is absolutely no reason a huge company like H&M should be doing this.

H&M,Terrible shipping times,"It has been almost two weeks since I placed my order and I'm guessing I won't get this order until after Halloween. Hopefully I get it before but so far I am thoroughly unsatisfied. If you want to buy decent clothing at a good price, just buy from UniQlo.",0,1
H&M,H&M is ridiculous!,H&M is ridiculous!! They are constantly advertising more items as they clearly have thousands of customers dollars tied up in preexisting orders that they CANNOT FULFILL IN A TIMELY MANNER. It has been over two weeks and no shipping. This is 2020 not 2001. It‚Äôs unacceptable customer service and it‚Äôs truly no wonder H&M is not doing well right now. It would be a different story if you‚Äôd put more resources into picking & packing orders instead of posting online. I have $300 tied up for weeks with NO shipping. By the time I get them they wont be seasonally appropriate.,0,1
H&M,Done with H&M,"I have six orders placed, none of which have shipped in weeks. Horrible customer service if you attempt to call, no one is of any help. H&M is a mess. Do not bother ordering online, they will place your order, tk your money and not send you anything for weeks!",0,1

H&M,I do really quite like H&M and I don't‚Ä¶,"I do really quite like H&M and I don't tend to have too many issues although not entirely stress free. There is a delay in receiving goods but I was aware of that from their statement online. My only issue recently has been with a gorgeous leather jacket. I ordered it in one size and it was massive so I went down a few sizes. Whilst waiting for delivery I visited one of the stores 30 miles away . I noticed they had a variety of sizes available of the same jacket. Great, if the one I ordered does not fit as I noticed, once again it was sold out online. When it arrived it didn't fit so I made the 30 mile trip to exchange. I had checked with Customer Service first and thet said I could that. When I went to the till I was told they would have to return the item and I would have to buy the alternative size. I pointed out that was not an exchange, I didn't fancy waiting to get ¬£140 back and spending another ¬£140!! The shop assistant checked with the manager and they also confirmed it would have to be done that way. I was a little fed up by this point. Having kept the copy of the email received from CS I showed it to the assistant again and said if he read it and it stated I was wrong and that in fact I could not have an exchange I would accept that. He ended up exchanging the item!!! It's extremely hard work for consumers when the advice they are given about standard returns policy is not understood by their own staff. So no stars to start with and 4 stars to end with. I always pay by Klarna incase there are any issues. It gives a bit more protection.",0,4
H&M,Horrible shipping times,"Absolutely terrible customer service... I placed my order over 2 weeks ago- hasn‚Äôt even shipped. Customer service will not let me cancel.

H&M,just disappointing.,i have ordered from hm twice now. the first order- i only ordered 2 shirts that took OVER 3 MONTHS to get here. they gave me a discount code for the next order as an apology so when I went to go order jeans a few weeks ago- it said it had expired but it did not mention it on the email with the code. The second order- it was still processing because I realized I didnt want them anymore so i asked if I could cancel it. They said it was to far even though it hadnt even been shipped yet or been paid for. I will not be ordering from hm online. Even the cheap sketchy stores online are better then this.,0,1

H&M,3 weeks and my ordered still isnt shipped,"I bought a turtleneck 3 weeks ago and it still hasn't left the warehouse. I understand shipping taking longer if you're in a pandemic, but I've ordered from several different places with absolutely no issue. This is getting a little ridiculous. If you want affordable mid-quality clothing, just buy from GAP or Uniqlo until this whole mess is over, or, better yet, just go to a thrift store or something. I completely regret my purchase from here.",0,1
H&M,Terrible,I ordered two pairs of boots a month ago. One pair is still in the process of being delivered and the other pair went out of stock and H&M sent me an email saying sorry here's a refund...so now I get half my order and still waiting on delivery. Terrible. Never ordering H&M online again.,0,1

I purchased about $70 worth of maternity clothes to get me through my last month of pregnancy. Order was placed on 9/23 and by 10/8 my order was still ""processing"" in the warehouse. I received several emails from H&M saying they're processing is delayed and sorry for the inconvenience. I contacted H&M customer service and asked if they would expedite my shipping as a courtesy once my order was finally processed because otherwise I wouldn't even be pregnant by the time my order got to me. The customer service agent basically said no they will not expedite my shipping. If I wanted expedited shipping, I would have had to pay for that myself at the time of checkout. Mind you, it was not posted anywhere by H&M on 9/23 when I checked out that processing was delayed whatsoever, otherwise I would have done expedited shipping. Then, every time I checked my order status, it said that processing is delayed 11 business days. So on the 12th business day when my order still hadn't shipped, I contacted H&M customer service again by phone (I was disconnected twice by phone and chat was ""unavailable""), I asked to simply cancel my order altogether because it still had not shipped after 12 business days, and they indicating shipping delays of 12-15 days. Maternity clothes would be pointless for me to receive by then because I wouldn't be pregnant anymore, and I certainly didn't want to go through the inevitable headache of returning these clothes through H&M at this point. I was informed by the agent on the phone that my order could not be cancelled and I would have to go through the return process if I wanted a refund. Again, they would not expedite my shipping so I could potentially get my maternity clothes on time. I'll reiterate that any processing delays were unknown at the time I made my purchase. The agent offered me a 25% discount on a future order, but there's no way I plan on spending any money at H&M again, even with a discount, after this ordeal. Incredibly disappointed and would not recommend to anyone.",0,1

H&M,Need to report this to BBB,"I would advise everyone to report their issue to the BBB. If you are using Klarna, it is worse because they will not let Klarna know that they processed a 'refund.' Here's what happened: I ordered a blazer, shoes and tee. When my order arrived it was missing the $40 blazer and tee. However, they included some BABY ROMPER! lol. I was honest and told them about the romper sent by mistake and they said they would not issue a refund for the tee and blazer until I returned the baby romper sent to me by mistake!! I was finally issued a 50% refund...BUT...they did not let Klarna know about this so I had to pay Klarna the full amount! So, I have no blazer and no tee and paid $70 for a pair of tennis shoes! Oh, and like just about everyone else on here, I too am waiting over 3 weeks for a few items that show still in warehouse 'processing.' One of those items is the blazer I reordered that never came last month.",0,1
H&M,Ordered 19 days ago,"Ordered 19 days ago, expected the order to ship in 3-5 days, they refuse to cancel the order because it's in the warehouse even though they haven't charged me for it yet. It's ridiculous, customer service is useless.",0,1
H&M,Prepare to wait forever.,"Ordered clothes on September 22nd, was told it would arrive in 4-6 business days, received a notification on 9/30 saying they were processing my order so it was shipping soon, then I received an email saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be at least 10 business days til we ship it‚Äù, now it‚Äôs been over 12 business days and still no sign of life from H&M. I called them only for them to ask me to call back on Friday. This is absolute nonsense.",0,1
H&M,Lovely boots but long delivery time,My first time ordering online for h&m and im very happy with my boots I was confused with sizing and there's no clear size guide im a UK 7 so I ordered a 6.5 fur lined boots and they are perfect so its eur 40 which is a 7 ..lovely boots so glad I don't have to return only reason I gave 4 stars is the waiting time took 6 days to get dispatch email but they came when expected so if your prepared to wait a week or so then its no problem ..I will use this site again üëç‚ù§,0,4
H&M,Incredibly disappointed,"Incredibly disappointed. I have been a loyal H&M customer for years, and I usually buy my clothes in person. However, the only store within proximity to me was out of everything I was looking for, so I decided to order online (which I don't mind). Placed order almost a month ago, was told shipping was 5-9 business days (no problem)! On the 10th business day I get an email saying ""blah blah blah we're sorry about taking longer than usual but we assure you your order will still be shipped within the time frame."" almost 8 more days pass, nothing. Finally received confirmation of dispatch, been nearly a week and the package has not moved. I understand businesses might be struggling, but I order a tonne online, and never have I ever recieved such deception about shipping services, and I will never order from H&M again.",0,1
H&M,Absolutely crap,"Two days after delivery was due: Still no parcel, and an even bigger silence from H&M. Their customer service employee Ally practically swore on her job that the package would be redelivered the very next after the first attempt, and no word since. Who cares about little things like following through on promises made to customers eh? And actually giving them the products they paid for? Get outta here! Stay tuned for an update tomorrow!---------------------------------------------------------------Absolutely crap. They use Hermes to deliver which is bad in itself. But H&M don't care about pesky things like good service or investigating their courier to ensure they do what they're paid for.Today, I received a message from Hermes stating they'd attempted delivery. Except they hadn't. I was home, parking open, concierge on desk. No phone call, door not buzzed. H&M (from someone called ""Ally"") like the muppets they are simply said ""Well, they were next to your building, there's nothing we can do. Wait for a re-attempt"". Thanks for taking ¬£100s of my money - will be returning my entire order.",0,1
H&M,13 business days to wait,"I have been waiting for 13 business days and my items has not even been shipped yet. I'm very upset, I won't order any more.",0,1
H&M,Horrible Customer Service,"The 10 delivery policy was not posted on their website when I placed my order, or I would have paid for faster shipping. Once I placed the order they changed the delivery policy twice. I only learned of the first changed when I contacted the company to inquire about my order. At that time, they changed to policy to deliver in 10 business days. Today is the 10 business day. Now they are saying my order will ship in 12-15 business day, so the policy has changed yet again. I called to speak with a supervisor and continue to be placed on hold and then conveniently the call disconnects. I finally was connected with a supervisor, but I think that was untrue because while she was ""checking"" my order the phones conveniently disconnects. Their customer service is very poor. When you attempt to send a complaint by email, their page is again ""conveniently"" under some sort of maintenance. You can fill out the email form but you cannot submit anything. At this point, I would like it if someone would contact me because I would like to cancel my order. When I inquired about canceling the order, of course they have no option to cancel. It shouldn't be common practice for representatives to hang up when you ask for a supervisor. Customer service is horrible!!",0,1
H&M,why am i not allowed to try on‚Ä¶,"why am i not allowed to try on clothes?! every other store is allowed to try on clothes. secondly, my god, it‚Äôs been FOREVER! waiting for an online shipment, bought summer clothes, and then the season changed, it got colder, i can‚Äôt even wear them by the time the items arrive, if they even arrive. the only place we can complain is on this site, as evident by everyone posting their negative ratings!",0,1

H&M,Looooooongest order processing times!,"Terrible customer service. I placed an order on 9/22. At the time there was no information or announcement on the page that there were delays in order processing, or I would have opted for a faster shipping method. I received an email 3 days after I placed the order stating that it would take 10 business days to process. It has been past 10 business days, and still no updated information on the two items I purchased.",0,1
H&M,love my new hoodie,"i ordered a hoodie on october 3rd for my halloween costume, and it got here on the 7th. i have no idea why other people are experiencing such delays, but my delivery came within the timeframe of the shipping that i ordered (expedited). i haven't been paid by h&m for this review.",0,5
H&M,Underwear return- DISGUSTING,"I was shocked to discover H&M can return underwear's. Thats disgusting, thats not hygenical and thats terrible. Especially now on Covid situations!!! People take home underwear's to try on and they do not wash it before wearing or after. So thats means they return in shop something they wear and H&M allows it!! DISGUSTING!",0,1
H&M,When did the harder ways  become the standard?,"Just like most, i made an online order over a month ago. Its 2 tee shirts and 2 sets of hair barrettes. Never mind it was 30$ but cause i loved these damn barrettes..its not even t shirt weather anymore. I mean, I order everything online now and i have had my share of wait times. A week or 2. Maybe 3 ..Until it arrived! Not until it was shipped. I JUST got the tracking # AFTER A MONTH! But, apparently waiting is the only option. Thats what customer service said about returning them before they actually leave warehouse. Just dont send the thing you cant get together and u keep your stuff and i get a refund. Its a clean wash for everyone. No shipping, no cost, simple. Nope, Have to go to a store or ship it back myself after it finally arrives. i asked it they have a convenience partnership with usp or fedex like amazon and walmart but rep instead detailed how to ship, in general. yea, thanks, lady. I got that part. Was hoping you could make something about this not a pain in my A*$. So, ima say dont order unless your its for next season. Then they will get there in time, no problem.",0,1

H&M,EXTREMELY LATE,"Just as others have stated, ordered on 9/20 and STILL do not have my products. Absolutely ridiculous. Contacted them 3 times and each time it's a lame excuse about Covid delays and even a ""holiday sale weekend"" delay. WTH! You're a HUGE company! Will never order again.",0,1
H&M,"Shipment late, item out of stock","Similar to recent review, expect delays in shipment. My online order made on 09/20 shipped today on 10/06. One item from the order, the reason I made an order in the first place (it was supposed to be my 3yr old autumn jacket) is out of stock. I was notified today about it. I wonder if I the same would apply if I paid +10$ for the express shipping when placing the order. Not nice H&M.",0,1
H&M,Expect a huge delay in your order. Email customer service!,"I placed my orders Sept 19/20. Initially my order was supposed to arrive within 5-9 business days, but without notification, H&M changed their processing times to 12-16 business days. When I first emailed customer service, the representative basically toldMe ‚Äúya we think your order will now be arriving between 12-16 business days.‚Äù This was frustrating. Then, I received an email stating ‚Äúyour order is being prepared in our warehouse, look out for a shipping confirmation soon.‚Äù11 business days had past and I was getting irritated. So, I emailed customer service and thank god a really great representative responded.I was notified of the following: Orders are shipping out on the 11th business days after order competition.Only reason why I‚Äôm leaving two stars is because the representative gave me an additional 20% off my order. Their tracking app is really terrible. Tracking number doesn‚Äôt mean anything. They ship with purolator international even though I‚Äôm from Toronto .. and after one business day, Canada post had created a shipping label for my order. Not sure what the deal is with the switching of couriers but it does not make things efficient",0,2
H&M,Suspecting someone from warehouse who might steal or change my ordered items!,"I do shop from H&M very often. Some of my orders are missed and they refunded..Some items were missed they ignored to refund in the past.. Also I returned many items by post, it was ok, but after a while, they did refund the wrong items which I was keeping.. I tried to proof and send them photos of items , but they still refund the same item, not what I returned! And now they are sending me wrong items and the label on the clear wrap bag is true but the item is wrong and rubbish items!! Staff is putting wrong and rubbish items in a true barcoded bag.. I am suspecting that someone from their warehouse is stealing or doing bad works! It cant be coincidence. Happened to me many times and I couldn't proof!",0,1
H&M,This place is a SCAM,"This place is a SCAM. They will take your money and you will never see what you bought. I will be making a Formal complain with the BBB. Someone needs to put this ""Company"" under investigation. The CEO or Owner should be place in Jail for Fraud.",0,1
H&M,DO NOT Order ANYTHING from this place,"DO NOT Order ANYTHING from this place. It has been the worst experience ever. My daughter's B day is just in a few days and I order some shoes about a month ago. When I was placing the order they said my product should be shipped in 5- 7 business days and here I am ONE MONTH LATER without my shoes. I called customer service A Week ago and the guy said my product was still at the warehouse but about to be shipped ( lies and lies and more lies). I called back again today (a week later) and guess what, my product is still at the warehouse. SHAME ON YOU GUYS for lying to ppl like that just to get their money, they tell u one thing when u r placing the order but then after they get your money they don't care it all it all... I spoke with a ""supervisor""( the only thing she said to me the whole time was: There is nothing I can do, there is nothing I can do bla bla bla. At the end i asked for my money back and guess what? They said they couldn't. WTH!!!??? The lady on the phone said I have to wait another what? Probably 2 months for the shoes to arrive, so I can send them back and THEEEEEN I can get my money back,??? Whaaat??? BS",0,1
H&M,One star is generous,"One star is generous. I received an email ********10 DAYS AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER******* saying orders were typically taking 11 business days to ship. It has been 13 business days and 17-18 calendar days (give or take a day, just sick of counting) and the status of my order says ‚ÄúPREPARING TO SHIP.‚Äù The worst part to me is that there is no warning on their site. They just want your money and give you no warning or heads up in anyway. I will NOT be giving them anymore of my business. ZARA is killin it!! They‚Äôre processing orders in 2-3 days at the most. Take your business there or ANYWHERE ELSE. K I‚Äôm done yelling for now. Disgusted and so frustrated.",0,1
H&M,One star far too generous. Order elsewhere,"One star is far too generous.I placed and order over 3 weeks ago, the order has not shipped and by the time it arrives it will have taken 4.5 weeks. Absolutely unacceptable. When calling to have this expedited, I was told there was nothing that could be done.I could not even cancel the order.Go to Macys , Kohls anywhere but H&M. Save yourself the aggravation",0,1
H&M,I wish I could give 0 stars,"I wish I could give 0 stars. They have the worst system and customer service in the world. I placed 2 orders 15 days ago....they still haven't shipped. Customer service just laughs at me whenever I call and they keep saying ""the warehouse will ship it when they get to it"" which is a completely unacceptable answer. If they're this backed up they shouldn't even be taking new orders honestly. Just don't order from here unless you want to wait 1-2 months for a delivery....maybe if it ever even comes. I ordered winter clothes but they probably won't even be here until the spring honestly.",0,1
H&M,SO ANNOYED!,"I've been a customer of H&M since 2008 and I never had issues with them up until recently. I made numerous orders the past year and they promptly refunded me when USPS lost my return packages. I have no issues shopping with them and their clothes are very affordable.However, I'm not happy with their system and how they don't resolve their own mistakes. When I put in my shipping address, the order selects it. My shipping and billing address are not the same. But when I submit the order, H&M sends me a confirmation that my order is being sent to my BILLING address. This wasn't the first time this happened. The first time, I let it go, but the second time, I tried to fix it by speaking to customer service.I go on live chat and the virtual assistance has options for my exact problem. It says that I could contact a live agent or phone agent to change the address so as long as my package isn't marked as shipped. My package was definitely not marked as shipped. Yet both agents on live chat and phone told me my address can't be changed even though I told them that it's not my fault because it wasn't!I even told them that the address book on my account doesn't even let me save a correct shipping address. So when I place orders, I KNOW for a fact that I manually type in my shipping address. Therefore, I know it wasn't my mistake that my orders keep using my billing address as delivery address. I told this to the agent multiple times and each time, they still insist they can't change the address or even cancel the order so I could correct H&M's mistake with a new order.What's the point of having a virtual assistance with these exact problems if orders can't be canceled and addresses can't be changed regardless of the reason? I'm basically being penalized for H&M's error. Now that we're in as second wave pandemic, I forgive the long shipping times because I'm not in a hurry to get my items, but now I'm being inconvenienced for a possibly system bug because I have to leave my home to go to the billing address to pick up a package when this issue could've been corrected so easily. Thanks for nothing. I tried not give an attitude on the live chat but the agent was making me so impatient that I just closed the chat on them.To add more insult, they took 20 days to fulfill my order, shipping to the wrong address AND used SurePost which is a super slow delivery method where UPS transfers my package to USPS. USPS then keeps my package for 4-5 extra business days before really delivering.EDIT Nov 18 2020On top of all this, I returned this same order with 3 pairs of pants and they gave me an incorrect refund of nearly $30 difference. Now I have to contact them to tell them. What's up with H&M?! It makes me not want to purchase from them again.",0,2

First time and my las time I order something with H&M",0,1
H&M,Do better H&M,"I've shopped at H&M many times and it's mostly been fine. Not overly helpful but I usually know what I'm looking for so no big deal. But this timeI went in 2 weeks ago and grabbed a cute kids shirt for $4.99. When I got to the register it rang up $9.99. The cashier told me I had the wrong shirt. We walked over to the rack together and all three shirts within the collection on the sign were coming up $9.99. She said the $4.99 shirt was misplaced. She asked a worker I'll call ""J"" for help. I could tell when J walked over, there was zero empathy for my $5 crisis (which is coolif it's not your job to care about such things.) J said there was no $4.99 shirt in that specific collection. I misunderstood and asked if it was available online. He said, ""NO it doesn't exist."" Got it. I asked if they would honor the price shown. J said no because customers put things in the wrong place. I pointed out this was obviously not the case, it was apparent the signage was wrong if there wasn't a shirt available for that price anywhere. J yanked the sign down, said something like ""no, not anymore"" and walked away, muttering something I couldn't make out. He did not return. I called H&M customer service and OMG. I was asked for a detailed email, pics of the signs and assigned a case number. I sent the information and didn't hear back from anyone. I called today to follow up and was told corporate is unable do anything because of Covid. She mentioned contacting the store since they would have received the ""feedback"" by now. I asked for the store managers name and store number- the representative didn't have that information. The number for the Quail Springs location I found online is disconnected. Y'all, I swear this is the most Karen review you'll ever get from me. Life is hard and I'm all about grace- I'm truly not one to get hot over $5....BUT the customer service was RIDICULOUS. I worked in retail for 20+ years and this incident is so inconsistent with most experiences that I had to share. Hopefully H&M will step up their retail training in the future, take customer feedback seriously enough to send a basic response and invest in some landlines for their stores. For now H&M and I are officially on a break #gapwontdomewrong",0,2

Ordered on the 29th Sept, get an email saying it is with Hermes last night but attached to the bottom of the email is 'Cancelled/Unavailable items' and half my order is gone. I am receiving a shirt and a hoodie while two plain black shirts, a cap and a pair of jeans have been cancelled due to being out of stock.

It‚Äôs an embarrassment. They look like they are stuck in the dark ages of e-commerce. They are being surpassed by every other retailer. People. Don‚Äôt buy from this terrible company. I‚Äôd rather give my money to someone who needs it than spend it with these thieves.

These wait times were not advertised when I made my purchase. Today is business day 15 yet the company still claims all orders are shipping by 10 business days. They have not been helpful in providing any updates or apologizes. Still no word on when I will even receive the order, but it is not looking good. Please do yourself a favor and go support another company. While I totally understand having shipping problems due to COVID, this company is not being transparent and is processing orders way slower than other companies.",0,1
H&M,"Ordered, still not recieved after 2 weeks of chasing","Ordered and now almost 2weeks later i see that my order hasnt even been dispatched and i have no idea whan it will be - they also claim they let you know of a possible delay however you recieve this warning over 4 days AFTER you place your order, you also cannot cancel / or get a refund or anything until the order arrives (no time frame on this happening so goodness knows when il recieve the order now). AVOID AT ALL COSTS - using covid as an excuse for crap service as all other orders from numbeous companies have arrived on time with no delay and adequate info on timings etc provided. shockingly bad in all ways ! UPDATE - as i chased this and got the ombusman involved (do it anyone else who has ordered) they suddenly changed it to dispatched HOWEVER only 1 item of the 7 i ordered is showing on the order now so WHAT THE ACTUAL F IS GOING ON??? - take it to the ombudsman folks as its the only way the do ANYTHING - i cant wait till i can send whichever of the items they bothered to send back and get a refund and avoid them like the plague ... absolute joke!",0,1

H&M,Scammers,"Ordered a couple of plain t-shirts from them, couple of weeks later order shows as delivered by USPS, but no where to be found in my building, mailbox or anything. I tried to get in touch with them to get a refund and a replacement, agent told me to look around the block, and then obviously refused to help me any further than that. Ridiculously cheap company, scamming people over 15 dollars. DO NOT BUY AT H&M.COM!",0,1
H&M,Surprise! Default shipping to UPS store,Ordered in the past. Without warning or prior notice they decided to change the default shipping address to a UPS store not my home address. I only noticed the shipping cost. It never even occurred to me to check the shipping address since that hadn‚Äôt changed. It delivered miles from my home. I‚Äôm not going to go get it. How about making the default shipping my home address!! Brilliant. Let ME change it to another address if I choose please. I‚Äôm afraid to order again. What new surprises will I encounter.,0,1
H&M,Cancelled sale order,I'm a loyal customer an place regular orders usually without issue but placed 2 large orders last week only to have both of them completely cancelled. I'm assuming this is because I used a unidays code and they don't want to honour the reduced price so have cancelled order to deliver the stock left to those who have paid full price. Customer service were useless. Not happy at all,0,1
H&M,Order late still in warehouse,I‚Äôve been checking on the status of some clothing I purchased and it still has not left the warehouse. This is so horrible. Checking online says they‚Äôve been having issues with online shipping since 2018. Does anyone know how I can cancel the order?,0,1

H&M,NEVER AGAIN DOING BUSINESS WITH H&M,NEVER AGAIN DOING BUSINESS WITH H&MOrder placed on 9/18/2020 and agreed upon shipping was 5-9 business days. The order status reads that the items are still in the warehouse and havent shipped. The best I‚Äôve gotten from H&M were two apology emails for the delay and an updated time frame of 10-13 days to deliver item. It has been 2 weeks since placing the order. Worst logistical planning one can experience from a well recognized international company.,0,1
H&M,Awful,‚ÄúIn process‚Äù for 2 weeks now,0,1
H&M,Failure to Provide Basic Customer Service,Order items and received the wrong items. Asked to speak to the manager and they did an awful job! Did not try to resolve my situation in the least. Customer service at H&M gets a failing grade. They have lost a customer today.,0,1
H&M,Placed an order Sept 17 - No idea when or if it will arrive,"Placed an order Sept 17, the shipping time as per my confirmation email was 5-9 business days. On Sept 25th they changed their shipping to 12-16 business days. I have called them 3 times and emailed back and forth, one customer service email from today states 'your order has not been processed', yet somehow I got an email on Monday letting me know it was ready for shipment soon. Nobody can say when my order will arrive, it has not shipped yet and they will not cancel it (they claim they only have 20-25 minutes after an order is placed online to cancel). So now I have to wait until some random date to see if my parcel will even arrive. I should note this was an order for almost $300 CAD. I spoke with a supervisor today who only told me they would waive the return fee if I want to send my order back, spoiler alert: returns are already free for members. So yeah, don't bother wasting your time ordering online. They have no idea where your orders are, or if they are even processed. Waste of time and money.",0,1
H&M,Do not fulfill orders!,"Bought a hoodie for ¬£39.99 within seconds of it being available , payment taken , order confirmed via email , 5 days Later order cancelled!

H&M,3 weeks in the warehouse!,I ordered a top on 9/13 and it is finally leaving the warehouse today (9/29). They do not let you cancel your order and can only return the item when it arrives. They originally said 5-9 business days when in fact it was more than 13. I will not be purchasing from them until the pandemic is over.,0,2
H&M,Another disappointed customer,I placed an order 7 business days ago. The order has not even shipped and there is no timetable for when it might ship. But I am lucky: some customers have been waiting four weeks! H&M is full of nonsensical excuses about difficulties at its warehouses. Their customer service is rude and incompetent. I won't order from them again.,0,1

On 9/29 received another email stating delays and no delivery date provided.I called customer service and the representative without even asking for my order # he said it takes about 3 weeks to ship and that the order could not be cancelled. He added that customers only have 15 minutes within placing the order to cancel it. The only option at this moment is to wait however long it takes for H&M to ship it. Unfortunately, I used a gift card I received for my birthday and can't even cancel the damn order that is taking so long to pull.",0,1
H&M,Shipping delay?  Miserable staff?,"It's been two and a half weeks since I put in an order and they haven't even shipped it. I ordered 1 ITEM!!!I reached out to customer service and I received a copy/paste default response about the pandemic and safety, two and a half weeks since I put the order in and not shipped.Also the staff member I spoke to said 10 to 13 days shipping, that's not what the shipping was when I put in the order.Waited 10 min to get ahold of someone and absolutely useless.I ordered something from Macy's on a Sunday night around 10pm and they shipped it Monday morning.This is inexcusable.Their store staff members aren't any better. Majority of them seem miserable and no matter how nice you are to them they are never nice back.I'll keep this in mind next time I need an article of clothing.",0,1
H&M,Would rate 0 stars if possible,"Would rate 0 stars if possible! Website auto deleted half of my address when processing order. Contacted livechat agents on two seperate occassions to fix this, was ensured this was fixed and my order would arrive within 24hrs. 3 days later I contact H&M again to be told my order is on its way back to the warehouse! Customer Service involved telling me I must reorder and wait a further 6-8days for delivery. Also unable to tell me when I will be refunded! Shocking, never again.",0,1
H&M,AVOID SHOPPING WITH H&M AT ALL COSTS!!,I placed an order over 1 month ago. Website states to wait 10 business days before delivery... currently waiting over 1 month. Order still processing... i spoke a few times to them they blamed it on usps... well!! Uses has been delivering items timely from other companies without ny issues. They can value usps once order is shipped. Currently my order hasn't shipped over 1 month after ordering. I called yesterday to cancel my order but I got disgusting customer service!! You hear?? They were nasty and abusive to me while all I asked is to cancel my order as I didn't need items anymore.,0,1
H&M,WARNING,"WARNING! Per H&M's Shipping and Delivery Policy, they have up to 30 days to ship an item, that means to pack before shipping. Once the item is shipped they can modify the delivery time based on 'unexpected events'. See the terms here ( https :// www2.hm.com /en_ca/customer-service/legal-and-privacy/terms-and-conditions. html)H&M is taking advantage of orders, holding them for 30 days, then processing in order to clear a backlog of orders. Then adjusting the delivery time once shipped.I, like others, have been waiting for 2 weeks - one month for items to be inventoried and packed, before they are shipped. DO NOT ORDER FROM H&M right now if you want to receive items within 1.5 months - 2 months. You will need to withdrawal the order or contest the charges with your bank/credit card company for inability to stock/deliver the purchase. Also ignore the recent positive reviews on trust pilot, these are paid reviewers hired by H&M to influence the rating, and scam you into purchasing something for an order which they have no intent to fulfill within 30 days. I was told by an H&M agent my order was fulfilled only to be told by another that it would take two days more, then another agent that it would take 7-10 days, then I started getting automatic replies. They aren't just overwhelmed with the orders, they are taking advantage of their customers who participated in their sale, and now have no intent to fulfill the orders - which, is why they recently modified their policy, as mentioned above. AVOID online order and support in store workers, if you can.",0,1

H&M,Fraud!,Fraud!Even after 40 days no refund. Even after many emails and phone calls they are not budging. I have multiple times checked the bank-account number which I have given them just to ensure I have not made a mistake. Also I have checked my bank balance to ensure it has not been credited. Upon asking them they ask for my bank statement with all transactions. They say they will transfer the money in 30 days. Why do they need 30 days? They are fraudsters delaying payment to make 1 month interest money. Hand in glove with the bank. On top of that now they are trying to get my bank statement which has details on my other transactions which probably they plan to sell to other e-commerce sites and make more money. So looks like clothing is just an excuse. This is a serious issue - not only of cheating but also a possible use of bank statements for other purposes. I am going to make a police case. Threat to society.,0,1

FLORINA a staff member was having a bad day decided to take her frustrations out on me when i was there refunding an item and price matching another. Due to paying with apple pay from my phone, she went mad at me why the last 4 digits dont match? I said this has always been the issue, if paid by apple pay last 4 digits are different to the bank card. Instead of getting help, She lost herself, went mad slammed her hands on desk demanding me to be quiet everytime i explained i always pay with apple pay in all other stores and i have no issues. This was all on the shopfloor in public with a massive queue behind me during post covid lockdowns and the customers where telling me off for making them wait. Because of FLORINA i was getting abused left right and centre. I was in so much pressure and shock i left the store with her still having my item but no refund! Walked back in to get my trousers that she did not refund me for, again she went mad at me: she literally gave me anxiety. Called customer service, was soo unhelpful, area manager named MARTHA, again they talk to you like they care but refuse to help and give you some credit and send you on your way. Their aftercare, problem solving to this extent is beyond unbelievable and you are left alone to deal with such abuse! FLORINA in that store is known to be problematic and she knows h&m do nothing hence why she continues to get away with it. Being my local store i have seen FLORINA treat other customers with such disrespect. H&m need to seriously train their staff on different payment methods and a refresher course on dealing with customers as they are destroying the reputation of H&M! Head office, customer service and area managers are all a joke, dont know why they even exist as they do absolutely nothing to help you! Btw, this store also accused me of stealing 3 months before this episode, they checked CCTV and they were wrong, got humiliated for no reason!

I can understand a delay but this is ridiculous. Wish I‚Äôd read the other reviews prior to making the purchase but I definitely won‚Äôt make anymore.

H&M,H&M has one of the worst possible‚Ä¶,H&M has one of the worst possible delivery service ever. I order on 9/9 and the site mentioned it was delivered and would reach around 5 business days.

H&M,The dishonesty is what bothered me the most.,"I reached out to customer service yesterday, 9/18/20 about my order that I placed on 9/8/20 with 5-9 day shipping. I politely asked for an estimate as to when my order might ship, as at that point it had been ten days. This morning it had shipped. What is interesting is that on H&M's tracking page, they made it look like the order was processed and shipped out on the 9th, the day after I placed my order. However, when I searched the tracking number on the UPS site, I can clearly see the label was only created yesterday after I had reached out about my order. They also said it would arrive no later than the 21st, but on the UPS site, the delivery is estimated to be on the 23rd.I can understand shipping delays, especially during these times, but I'd always appreciate honesty and transparency about my merchandise and where it's at. I love H&M's clothes, but I don't think I will be placing any more online orders with them. I'd definitely suggest just shopping in stores, it seems like the online ordering process is just dishonest and stressful.",0,3

I did, so i can cancel order. Sorry, we cannot cancel order, because it will ship soon. (Yes, it has been shipping soon, for almost 2 weeks now..) season will be over before items arrive, god forbid if i needed them for a special occasion.

I am a very regular customer of theirs as I love the range of clothing, prices are very competitive and delivery is always great. They're by far my favourite store.

H&M,Slow service and no respect for the client,"This is the second time i buy from H&M online store and both times the H&M team does everything for a very long time. I bought from H&M online store on 17.08.2020, got the confirmation email and nothing else happens! I wrote to the support service many times and received a reply that the package will be sent in 48 hours. H&M team needs all week to dispatch the parcel, they cannot ship out for a whole week, although they must deliver the package to the client in 2-7 days, not dispatch in 2-7 days. Service is very slow, a week has already passed and nothing has changed. The customer service team aren't helpful. UPDATED. I received first package on August 25th later then expected, a package without a box, just in a plastic bag. The leather belt had an unpleasant smell, I do not recommend buying. I sent my purchase back. Before buying, first, I called all the H&M stores in my city, and when I learned that the premium quality items I had chosen were not in any store, I ordered them in the H&M online store. One pair of jeans and a premium quality leather belt as a gift, and two premium quality trend coats for me and my mom. The package with the gift came too late, I had to return it. And how surprised I was that H&M charged me 3.99‚Ç¨ for return shipping. Although it was not my fault that the parcel arrived late, and how many times I contacted customer service - no one helped, empty blah blah blah. Plus, a premium leather belt isn't premium at all. The skin smells disgusting. In general, I do not recommend buying from H&M online store if possible. Because the delivery is long, not on time. And only spoil your nerves by dealing with the seller. No respect for the client at all. But the coats are good, with cashmere, and that's why I give such a rating. If you buy online, keep in mind that the package takes a long time and you will be charged a return fee.",0,3

She tells me she can't do anything about it, neither can H&M, and then I should contact my post office (who will not let you change it and tells you h&m is responsible for changing it). She then tells me that it can take up to 22 days to receive an order, and that the 5 to 9 days on the website, is just a rough estimate and not likely. She tells me that it's not outside of the 9-day window yet (even though it it's the 9th day and it is states away and not shipped), And that I should add an additional 13 days to that and if I don't receive it I can file a lost package claim. I explained again that I was out of town helping family, and that the address that was being sent to was not an address where I could get something from after I left. She ignored me and kept copying and pasting the statement about how shipping can take up to 22 days (which is NOT listed on their site). Their site states ""5-7 BUSINESS DAYS"" in the reference chart about covid and at checkout 5-9 days. 22 days is more than double that and it's not disclosed. So now i will be out the money for the entire order. If they had just been truthful about the shipping dates I would have had it sent to a different address, But instead they're lying to their customers and giving a false date this less than half of what the actual shipping date is promised. I will not be shopping with H&M ever again.Update 8/3:My mail forwarding caght he package and over 31 days later the package arrived. H&M made me pay an additional $10 to get to from the post office, despite having sent it incorrectly to begin with. After 2 hours on the phone, they promised that I could return the items past 30 days since it was in transit due to COVID and that they'd give me a refund for what I paid in shipping....when I got to the store to return what didn't fit, I was told I could NOT return past 30 days, even though customer service told me I COULD. They tried to pass it through manually, and instead of the $45 I was owed back, I was told it would get $26 because the customer service rep didn't refund me for the shipping I paid, but adjusted my items price so that my clothes was cheaper and if I tried to return it H&M would still get to keep my money. The staff at H&M saw this and tried to refund it anyway, stating how wrong the online service was and how it shouldn't happen. Everything went through (even though they couldn't get my full refund amount, it was about $3 less than what I paid) and then I got an email over 2 hours after I left the store saying my refund was REFUSED.. So now they have my items AND my money!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR MONEY BACK.",0,1
H&M,HORRENDOUS SERVICE!!!,If only I could give them 0. I ordered on H&M India website and didn't receive any confirmation for it anywhere. My payment got deducted. And it was a Friday. I tried to call them regularly for days but their customer service is absolute garbage. I have never come across any online shopping website whose customer care number rings as SWITCHED OFF for like FOREVER!!! I tried n number of phone numbers searching on Internet to no avail. Nobody was willing to help them. They do not even have the email address where I can raise my complaint. My mails kept diverting to UK or Ireland branches which was so annoying. The chat section doesn't work. Nobody is assigned to help me no matter how long I wait and I have tried n number of times. I am still freaking out waiting for some text back or mail or call to get either my order or my refund. My whole experience with H&M online was horrendous.,0,1
H&M,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,So i decided to write a review for the first time. Ive been a H&M customer for a long time and i have never been disappointed Until this very moment. How RIDICULOUS the return policy of H&M. First you can‚Äôt try clothes in the store (which i totally understand) but what I don‚Äôt understand are the sale products that you can‚Äôt try in the store are only allow for exchange on top of that they don‚Äôt even give you gift card/store credit for it if you can‚Äôt find anything you want for exchange like how stupid that is. So it only means that you have no choice but to to buy products that you don‚Äôt like just coz return days almost done and can‚Äôt try in the store knowing at the end Of the day you have to go back to the store to exchange it again!! What a vey disappointing policy knowing that it is not COVID free but your force to go to store again and again to return or exchange instead of Just use the store credit/gift card online to shop!!,0,1
H&M,"If I could give a ""0"" star review","If I could give a ""0"" star review, I would. I have shopped at the Summerlin Mall location many times, and the girls have always been genuinely kind, however, several of the young boys that work at this location have serious attitude, dispicable behavior, and are far, very far from being customer service oriented. Unfortunately, the only name that I got was Eric (their acting manager on duty). He was the absolute worst! Yesterday, I purchased 9 items,and the cashier charged me for 11. Unfortunately, I had to go back today to adjust the mistake made by their employee. (I am currently medically exempt from wearing a mask, and rarely have any issues with being in public, as long as I maintain the appropriate distance, and under that rare situation, I will put on a mask if need be, and I do carry one with me just in case). Overall, people have been genuinely understanding and kind, however, not at this H and M location. The 1st 2 boys approached me with utter rudeness, and as I tried to gently explain my situation, they walked away while I was in mid sentence. and the 3rd person, Eric walked over with arrogance and complete meanness, and told me to get out if I don't put the mask on!!! I was never greeted with a "" hello"" , ""may we help you"" , "" how are you""... nothing! I was then told that the first boy that helped me was uncomfortable, so therefore, I have to wear a mask! If Eric would have spoken to me in a kind manner, and talked to me like a human being, I would have obliged, and gotten out of there as fast as I could, however he was the worst! How this guy could be allowed to be in the public eye, and manage, tells me that H and M doesn't have high standards in whom they hire. Now,for the record, that first boy/ cashier, was also the one to ring up my sale incorrectly, yesterday, causing me to go back to the store today, to rectify the situation. This boy, if so worried, never mentioned anything about me not wearing a mask, yesterday, but all of a sudden, he had a problem with it,and on top of it, he acted like he didn't know who rung me up incorrectly, the day before, and it was him (as if he didn't know his own sales number, and of course,NO apology! The manager from the day before,was quite understanding with the mask exemption, but today was another story. The corporate manager on duty today was far from helpful, as well.",0,1
H&M,Extremely bad service,"Extremely bad service, unfriendly and incompetent! First package never arrived, it was returned to the warehouse and was supposed to be sent out a second time according to the person I spoke with. The package never arrived and was returned to the warehouse again and then refunded (although I had been in contact with them several times and chased the package). A new order was made and basically exactly the same thing happened again only this time talking to customer service was an awful experience since they were extremely rude and unprofessional. In the end the money will be refunded in 15 days and my order canceled... I will never shop at H&M online store again!!

They never refunded me for missing items, either. I don't know what to say. This is the worst experience I've ever had - I've been robbed as well as not refunded.

I'm a college student who wanted to buy myself some clothes as I've been struggling with the virus right now, and I ended up getting robbed by my favourite brand.I have no job - there's no openings when I check.

H&M,Poor store experience,"Website has always been great, no issues there, it's the local store (Swindon) that's the problem.The staff are just SO slow at serving. This isn't a new thing, it's been this way for years. I went in with my baby and he started to get a little unsettled. When we eventually got to the front of the queue, the assistant was trying to get me to sign up for a membership card, at this point my baby was crying and I just wanted to get out of there. The assistant didn't want to take no for an answer, so turned to my friend and asked her if she had a card that she could scan. She said she gets into trouble if she doesn't scan a card!As I got to the lift, I got there at the same time as some staff moving some rails of clothing. As soon as the lift arrived, they ignored me completely, moved their rails into the lift and shut the door, leaving me there with a screaming baby.Not only is it poor customer service, but it would have been nice for them to show a little kindness and compassion.

Some items have been washed a few times and are in really good condition. I got lots of basic items, so nothing too extravagant, but I really like them all and will definitely go to H&M to find clothes in the future (especially for my kids - but hopefully they are fine for a little while now as I spent way too much).",0,5

Another hour later I got through again and this time was able to eventually get confirmation that I would be refunded, although in two separate payments as I had sent items from two orders in one package and the advisor is only authorised to give one refund for one order apparently. Anyway I did finally receive the refund but it was literally like pulling teeth. I am convinced that had I not persevered I would never have seen my refund at all and it was almost ¬£80. I have another refund pending and anticipate having to go through this while sorry saga again. It‚Äôs a real shame as I do love H and M but this experience means I will only ever buy in store from now on. This truly has been the worst customer service I have ever received.

I am now being forced to take another $10 card and get $10 back to my credit card. When I said that was not a fair process the guy did not seem to care.

I have never heard of such bogus policies! Meanwhile they‚Äôve charged my credit card and the charge went through as of 6/29/2020. Clearly H&M just wants to hold on to our $$$ for as long as they could without following through on our orders. They‚Äôre scamming us with their bogus and dishonest ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù. Do not order from H&M!",0,1
H&M,Missing refunds,I just realised that the Postal returns I made over the last few months haven‚Äôt been refunded. I trusted H&M so hadn't been checking.

I expected delays. So weeks go by, I check the tracking info, the package is still in warehouse. Three weeks go by and its still being processed in a warehouse. It's been a month now and my package is being handled in some shipping terminal in Indiana. I'm from Ca and who knows when it will arrive. H & M sent me an email, stating they have had glitches and issues with their tracking system. Therefore, the whereabouts of my package are not updated or recent. So, they sent me a 20% coupon for another online order. Don't shop here, wait until shops open, or shop at other stores with better shipping times! UPDATE: If you do order from H&M make sure to use the tracking number from USPS. I used this and had the option to receive an email when the package arrives. My package will arrive tomorrow (ordered May 29th, tomorrow is June 30th). So, over a month. Will update on quality and whether or not it is worth it. Also, I ordered a belt, and later received an email stating it was no longer available. I haven't received a refund for that. FINAL UPDATE: Overall, I would wait until H & M stores are open. The hassle of tracking your package, shipping, and if you have to make a return isn't worth it. Since COVID, customers like myself are attempting to shop safely. H&M has not made the experience any easier...",0,1

I patiently waited about 3 weeks to receive my refund, given current COVID circumstances, I understand that they likely have less people processing thousands of orders. But - I received my refund today for half of my order. I called and spoke to someone who said I only received the refund for the bikini top I returned, not the bottoms that they sent me the wrong size in... they then asked me to confirm I used their label (yes) and to confirm I'd returned both part (yes).

There is no way to contact Hermes or H&M team to find out what is happening and when will I get my refund. Pandemic is not an excuse anyone.. everyone had enough time to adjust to new reality and new customer behaviour. Companies such as Zara, Asos, Berghaus or Cotswold Outdoor are able to provide its customers with the next day delivery... so why H&M can't?

During full lockdown they told me to take it back to the store and reorder it again. Cheers for nothing. Then ordered two single sheets with a 25% off one item code I was given for my birthday, one came very clearly opened, possibly used and SHOVED back in the pack but the other was new. EWWW!!! Again told to send back and reorder, no explanation given as to why I had been given a used one. The sheet was now out of stock and they said offered 15% my next order when I complained! Doesn‚Äôt help if nothing is in stock! I wish I could say that it‚Äôs down to the lockdown but last year I ordered two pairs of the same sandals for my twins in as they don‚Äôt stock 2 pairs of the same size in store. They charged for both and sent one. I was offered a refund for one missing pair but they were out of stock so this is just them I think. Won‚Äôt be shopping there anymore",0,1
H&M,Someone is stealing our packages or they are on a skeleton crew,"Like everyone else is saying...I ordered my things almost a month ago and have yet to receive them . In the meantime I've ordered and returned things from Zara and got my items and refunds since ordering at H&M. This Pandemic is no excuse. To save money, they probably let more warehouse workers go or laid them off, so now they may be working with a skeleton crew and it is taking forever for customers to get their items. I had been ordering things since March and I feel like it just got this bad, within the last month. Its unfortunate because I love their clothes but don't want to waste my time, money or emotions on this nonsense.",0,1
H&M,Have to chase for refunds!,I love H&M for well-priced children‚Äôs clothes and their basic women‚Äôs range however I have now stopped shopping with them. Twice I have had to chase H&M for refunds when I‚Äôve returned items. The online chat team always say it takes 14 days for a return to arrive back with H&M however on both occasions they have magically discovered with the tracking number that they have in fact received my returns! And a refund can be given on the spot.,0,3

I got an email on May 23rd saying my items just shipped SMH. It‚Äôs June 8th and I have not received my items or any more emails, and when I attempt to track my items they seemed to be stuck in Indianapolis for the past 2 weeks. I needed these items for this past weekend and now I just don‚Äôt even care for them anymore. Worst experience shopping online with them! I also ordered, the same day, from Zara/Hollister/Nordstrom and I received my items within a week. This is so frustrating!",0,1
H&M,Absolutely awful delivery service,Absolutely awful delivery service. They have returned at least twice back my order because the could not deliver to the pick up point that they had available in their system. And you try to discuss with the costumer services and end up talking to a child that does not even provide a solution let alone apologize. Worse experience ever,0,1
H&M,H&M and Klarna are the worst together,Ordered through the H&M app. The default of paying for your order is payment installments through klarna. Didn‚Äôt realize that when making my purchase because that‚Äôs an option you usually choose through any other company. They do a soft credit check but I don‚Äôt want my credit checked because credit is a pain in the butt as it is. So I contacted both h&m and klarna Trying to resolve the problem. Still have to pay through klarna which makes me mad and when contacting them they said that in the beginning that my credit score wouldn‚Äôt be affected but later in the conversation said that it would get dinged. Hopefully I contacted them soon enough where they won‚Äôt ding my credit. Anyway h&m needs to change the default setting as klarna as the first payment option and if you are purchasing through H&M and don‚Äôt want to pay through klarna scroll down and choose the credit/debit payment method.,0,2
H&M,Worst Customer Service Ever,"Worst Customer Service Ever! I bought an E Gift card online, paid with Credit Card, but it was never received.

H&M,The WORST customer service I've ever experienced.,"Yesterday I experienced the WORST customer service I've ever had from a retail business. First of all, the policy put in place to close fittings rooms due to COVID-19 is rather nonsensical at this point, not to mention extremely impractical. Due to this restriction on the shopping experience, customers are forced to buy first and try clothes on at home, which is what I did with a pair of jeans I was really excited about on Friday. I knew the size I had purchased was likely going to be too small, since the only pair left in the size I would normally wear were the ones on the mannequin. After asking an employee at the till if I they could assist me in getting the jeans in my size, they refused to take them off the mannequin for me during store hours due to it being a ""safety hazard"". Lets get this straight: ANY other clothing store would/does do this ALL the time when a customer requires a size that has been used for a display.The employee tells me that she will make a note for the evening staff to switch out the jeans on the mannequin that night so I can come back and make an exchange for them the next day (yesterday). Having worked in retail myself and being an understanding individual I said sure and gave her my name. I then attempted to call the store location in Polo Park Winnipeg yesterday morning to ensure the jeans had been put aside before I asked my friend for another ride to the mall since I don't drive. I was put through to the H&M call center rather than to the store location. Once on the phone with a random operator, he hung up on me accidentally. I called back. I got a new operator who told me that store locations were not taking calls due to COVID-19???!!??? Not taking calls???! How on earth is that a risk related to the pandemic??? After receiving ZERO help over the phone, I decide to try my luck and catch a ride over to the mall in hopes that someone had done their job right the night before and that the jeans would be behind the counter waiting for me as promised. I got there and of course, the jeans were still on the mannequin. I asked yet again if I could exchange the jeans I had bought that were too small for my proper size which were on display. Yet again I was told I couldn't have them off the mannequin at that moment, and that I would have to come back the next day. I explained I was already told that, and that I even tried calling beforehand but was met with a complete lack of competence over the phone.The girl working the till was very nice and she apologized then called her manager over to speak with me. To be clear, I NEVER do this sort of thing, but I was in shock at the utter display of ignorance by this company. I spoke with the manager and explained the situation, she was EXTREMELY RUDE AND DISMISSIVE and simply said no to my request for the jeans. At that point I said fine, I'll just return them then since you clearly would rather this be a loss of sale. How ridiculous. I will never shop at H&M again after this experience as I am still dumfounded at the lack of care and effort shown by this company.",0,1
H&M,I ‚ù§Ô∏è H&M,"I have ordered with H&M online for the last 2 years, I've paid by both card and Klarna, and have never had any issues. I believe, considering the Pandemic and how staff may be short during this pandemic, H&M have been very satisfactory. I've waited between 3 - 14 days for items and they have informed me each time, they have delivered on time. Bear in mind that sometimes, in these demanding times, companies may need up to 30 days to ship an order, it's not unreasonable if you're prepared to wait, people in the warehouses, etc. I applaud you! We're it not for people working these roles, in frightening times no less, you wouldn't be able to get a little retail therapy. The retail environment is currently under serious stress: people need to have patience. If you work with them, when there is a problem, they will work with you. I think some of the bad reviews here are unfair.I've always been happy with my purchases via H&M. If you want more security, use Klarna, that way you can report to them when you have not received an item or process a return through the app, where Klarna will monitor and make sure you recieve a refund.Be kind, this company is working hard and so are all its staff, more importantly, their safety comes first and if that means taking longer to deliver items because of staff shortages then so be it. Would you want your loved one working in unsafe environments? Would you want them being forced to go to work when they weren't feeling safe? There will be staff shortages, have some understanding. The store in Leamington Spa is also always a pleasure and its staff are so friendly, can't wait 'til it opens and to shop there again but for now, the website is just perfect! - A Very Happy Customer and proud VIP Member",0,5
H&M,If you want to be charged and never receive your order or any update 3 months later then shop at h&m!,"If there was zero star its what h&m online and customer service would deserve.

If you want to get charged, never receive your order nor any update/phone call for 3Months, hardly reach customer service after around 25 calls and 15 emails with to reply, to request cancellation and refund, and 3 weeks later find out no one actually bothered to even initiate refund then shop at h&m. Awful and dreadful experience. Do not order anything online here!",0,1
H&M,I cannot believe how bad the delay is....,I cannot believe how bad the delay is for shipping out items. I have ordered a lot of items from other retailers during this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù and I have received everything in a timely manner with no complaints. H&M needs to get it together.

H&M,I would give them no stars if I could‚Ä¶,"I would give them no stars if I could but I want everyone to avoid this store. Due to the pandemic I ordered a suit for my son for wedding June 15th and I ordered these items May 12, 2020 I received them June 4, 2020. They sent me everything but the pants of the suit! With my order number stating I ordered an entire suit. I paid 150.00 for this order and waited 2 weeks for it and didn‚Äôt receive what I already got charged for. I called customer service and spoke to 3 different people and they all refused to help (didn‚Äôt care it was my wedding) and they said it was out of their control. Even though it was their mistake and not mine, they couldn‚Äôt give me my money back unless I went out of my way to go return the WRONG items they sent me, even though I didn‚Äôt receive what I ordered and was charged. I want to state that even though everywhere there is delayed shipping, companies have shipped items to me in less than 14 business days. They wouldn‚Äôt ship the pants to me sooner than that And expected me to drive to the nearest store to return (45 min away!). I will NEVER buy from this store ever again and I will be writing everyone about it to fix This customer Service issue. I am disappointed and we didn‚Äôt need to go through another hurdle during this time to make our wedding happen. As an RT fighting covid in the frontlines, I thought having my wedding still take place would be a blessing but everyone keeps making it impossible and H&M didn‚Äôt care to make it any easier.",0,1

H&M,Still waiting for a parcel. Terrible customer service.,"I‚Äôve been having a terrible time with my H&M order over the last few weeks. This is an issue for H&M customers services but is linked to Yodel.

I texted Yodel and messaged Yodel via the contacts given about the driver for my particular order, asking them to kindly post through the letterbox, but no parcel or response weeks later.I have had a conversations going via H&M customer services for weeks and the advisors clearly don‚Äôt read the messages properly.

H&M,Affordable clothing,"I have owned many pieces from H&M over the years, you can really find some great stuff there. I do noticed the prices are going up, but what isn't? I do hope their quality will keep up. Overall, I still love this brand!The IN STORE experience could be overwhelming for some, because there are so much to look at. But if you have time to kill, this is the place for you! And I persoanlly prefer this way. The ONLINE experiences got even more to offer, I often noticed ""online exclusive"" items which can be frustrating because I love the experience of shopping in person and being able to try things on and feel the materials. With that being said, I did order couple items and have returned a couple items without any customer service issues. But its time consuming and disappointing when you've waited a week or so for your items to come in, just to find out it's not what you wanted.Then you gotto send it back, and wait another week of so for your refund.

I spend ages on hold as the online chat couldn‚Äôt help with my problem. After speaking to a lady on the phone I discovered that H&M hadn‚Äôt refunded all my returned items. It appeared that when I had order two of the same item in two different sizes, I was only refunds for one item! She has now managed to sort out the refund although it was her word against mine. I have to say I won‚Äôt be placing big orders again! It only because I‚Äôm so on top of my finances that I noticed the error. How many other people don‚Äôt get the refund they are due because someone in the returns department can‚Äôt do their job properly!

They are so bloody useless it's unreal. Twice I was palmed off with the wrong number, then just hung up on coz she said she cldnt help. I had to phone the driver ( who wasn't the driver who had my parcel). apparently they tried to deliver three times (which is not true because u beknown to me the office was actually open but for fewer hours.) Spoke to three people at yodel when finally someone change the address said it was no problem. Anyway the parcel said it was delivered but I do not have it. Phoned H&M oh yeah no problem we will change it for you and update your address. Waited a week. Phoned again. My account wasn't updated and the parcel was not redirected. Who do these ppl think they are? A refund is not enough after how much I've been messed around. Utterly useless the lot of them I am so disappointed because I love H&M but alas they will lose out of my shopping because I never bloody get it. Oh yes this has happened before.

She told me to contact the courier directly for one of the parcels once it was dispatched and to call H&M back once the other parcel had been dispatched so that they could put in a query with the other courier. I have now been trying for 2 days to get back in touch to edit the address, but this seems to be an impossible task. Where this is a time-sensitive matter as the order will otherwise be delivered elsewhere, I would expect a better service. It is impossible to get through via live chat, social media, phone and even emails take almost a week to be replied to.

I've order from H&M many times over the last few years and I have had to sometimes return orders but I have never had any issues with them.",0,5
H&M,I have always been a fan of h&m brand,"I have always been a fan of h&m brand! Most of my children clothes are from there. During the lockdown day my children grew out of their clothes therefore I place am order for both of them. They decided to send their clothes using two parcels. The eldest one received all his clothes, and I am still waiting for my toddler clothes (placed the order on the 15th). They sent me an email to say it has finally been shipped, however they canceled my toddler‚Äôs sandals. They should have informed me ages ago about this, as when I have placed the order there was stock available. They have also returned my money and reattempted to take it back today which is a but doggy! Will do my shopping to river island from now, much more efficient!",0,1
H&M,Disgraceful service and communication,"Ordered some clothes for my children. For some reason my order was split in two parcels???? So 4 days ago Hermes delivered the first one. I was confused why it's only one. So I contacted H&M by email asking where is my second parcel, instead of explaining anything to me they just emailed me another tracking number and it appears to be Yodel??? Who still hasn't received parcel from H&M. So again send email to H&M asking why my parcel isn't with Yodel yet, because in email they send me 4 days ago it says ""my order has been shipped ""Too many questions- not even one answer. Never again will be buying from them.",0,1
H&M,Strange ordering procedure and none existent support for transaction problems,"Made a purchase using PayPal. No problems..... until delivery day when a second payment for the order total was taken. Not entirely sure if this was a system mistake or their procedure but their customer service is absolutely appaling. The advisor talked over me, wouldn't listen and refused to admit that H and M had made a mistake somewhere. So I was none the wiser as to what had happened.After contacting my card issuer I was told H and M had preautorised my card then applied for the payment again on the day of delivery. The bank told me they need something in writing from H and M advising they will not be applying for first preauthorised transaction. H and M are unwilling to help as they refuse to admit this has happened. So the current situation is that I have to wait a month for the preauthorised transaction to fail and be recognised by the bank system as a failed payment and be returned to me. This means that the value of the order has been doubled and I have to wait a month to get the money back.First and last time I'll order off H and M online and realistically when things get back to normal won't be going back in store because of this experience with both the online ordering and their customer services. Shame as the clothes bought for the kids are lovely but unfortunately I'm not putting up with this situation or giving H and M any more of my gard earned money.",0,1

H&M,Hopeless,"H&M‚Äôs response to COVID has been totally crap! I‚Äôve been ordering from these guys for ages and never had any problems. I used to receive my deliveries in 2-3 days. Now 2-3 weeks later it hasn‚Äôt even left the warehouse, seriously, every other company seems to be getting deliveries out fine. I won‚Äôt be ordering with H&M until I can go back in store",0,1
H&M,Horrific experience,"Horrific experience. I normally shop at H and M often and love their prices but their response to covid is absolutely horrible. I ordered a package like three weeks ago and it's been saying that usps is waiting for the package to arrive to them so they can ship it. It has been saying that for days. I contacted customer support and waiting for 40 min before an agent started a chat with me and the moment the agent got on, the cat randomly stopped and wouldn't let me say anything. Then I emailed them 2 weeks ago and still no response. Absolutely trash. Extremely dissapointed. Pacsun got my order and had it at my doorstep in a week, even though covid is active. H and M is garbage, don't order online.",0,1
H&M,AVOID H&M,"Omg wow! I wish I would‚Äôve read the reviews before ordering from H&M this year. I always shop online/in store with them but this year is crazy! I spent $236 that was charged on my card on May 3. That‚Äôs when I ordered! Well 3 days ago I was -96 on my bank account! I called my bank and they said H&M was the reason! Wth? Makes no damn sense! Guess H&M returned my money and charged me again!!! Anyways I‚Äôve been literally waiting for almost 3 weeks for my shipment to be delivered and every day it says the same, ‚Äúit‚Äôs in transit‚Äù ... I asked for my money back just yesterday because literally I can‚Äôt keep waiting! They said it was impossible. I‚Äôd have to wait till the 30th so they can file a lost package!! That is NOT my problem! I need my order NOW or my refund NOW!!!! DONT SHOP HERE DURING THESE TIMES. PLEASE AVOID H&M at all costs.Update: I just called to get a refund. And they processed it. Ordered May 3rd it‚Äôs May 29th and my package is still in transit. My order was never gonna arrive. UPS is to blame for this. I‚Äôm sorry H&M I just couldn‚Äôt keep waiting.",0,1

I contacted newgistics but it kept leading me to voicemail and my package said ‚Äúin transit‚Äù for a month. Eventhough h&m is not at fault for the missing package, they were still willing to refund my money. Awesome customer service!",0,5
H&M,I‚Äôm surprised at how negative these reviews are,"I ordered three things from H&M on the 5th of May, and was emailed to let me know my parcel would be here in 9-14 days. Two weeks later it arrived, which is a little slow but within the time they said and considering the current situation not too bad. They also kept me updated every step of the way. All three items were lovely quality, wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to order again!",0,5
H&M,Confusing website,I was trying to order clothes from the website but found it confusing to navigate through to find exactly what I wanted,0,3
H&M,poorly designed website,i had seen some products i wanted on a facebook ad from H&M and thought i‚Äôd try order them but upon looking for the items i found website was so hard to use and there were no specific categories. This ended up putting me off ordering from them. i‚Äôll stick to shopping from H&M in store.,0,2
H&M,Same as most of the reviews below.,"Same as most of the reviews below.. non arrival and very late despatch. To their credit, I asked for a refund and got it immediately. Won't be ordering from them again.",0,1
H&M,H&M are appalling,Your website automatically saved my old address. I tried to change this using your automated chat - it did not work. I called to change the address and was told the order would I have to be cancelled - I said well cancel it then and I was informed that YOUR computer system was down and to call back the next day. The next day I was told I would have to return this order to receive my refund. I explained that I lived in a completely different part of the country now - I was told H&M could only contact Hermes their driver to request the parcel not be delivered ü§® therefore I informed you that Hermes has emailed me and you needed to contact them (as I was asked) and you told me I would not get my refund if this was delivered unless it was sent back to you. How can I sign for my delivery if I don‚Äôt live there? So Hermes have left a parcel at an address and now you expect me to pay ¬£350 for items I will never receive? You as a company have made zero effort to attempt to resolve this or mu financial anxiety whatsoever.I advise no one to ever order from H&M,0,1
H&M,Seriously?,Delivery says that they‚Äôre running standard 9-14 day shipping on all items due to Covid... well here I am almost a full month later and my items still have yet to be in my possession. Yes it is during an epidemic but even still I‚Äôve ordered things from Nike and Nordstrom literally a week after ordering from H&M and those items got here before. If they aren‚Äôt ready to deal with online business when it comes to shipping then just shut the websites down because at this point they‚Äôre only stealing money.,0,1
H&M,This company are total scam artists.,This company are total scam artists.. i ordered a ‚Äúrug‚Äù which ended up being a rubber mat for my daughters baby room and it arrived 4 months later! They are total pieces of shitt!,0,1
H&M,Terrible,"Terrible! I ordered 4 items almost 3 weeks ago, 3 days ago I received a notification that it was shipped with one item missing. I don't need another one without that one because they go together. But no-one cares to ask... So I'll have to return one... I went to the website and they still say it's available although it's not! And even if it is it will most certainly disappear during those 2 weeks they don't go further with your order... And I even haven't received it yet. Very disappointed.",0,1
H&M,Do not order,"Do not order. Same with all these other people it has been since April 20, till now May 19, and my items havent even shipped?! Still processing! They should warn their customers it will be a month ++ to even ship. Very poor.",0,1

H&M,Garbage service,Complete arssholes!!! Charging people twice when you purchase online and denying it and tell you to go deal with the bank lol. They dont care about their customers very bad managent and sercive!! Never everrrr purchasing from h&m again!!!,0,1
H&M,I highly suggest you don‚Äôt order right now,I highly suggest you don‚Äôt order with them during this time period. Your wait time will more than likely be long just like everyone else in here. Their standard shipping is anywhere from 9-14 days but I‚Äôm on day 16 without my package. On day 7-8 I received an email saying I‚Äôd get shipping info ‚Äúvery soon‚Äù and then that never came. Had to talk to a customer service rep for them to make my order a priority. When you compare their shipping to other stores/sites during this pandemic The wait time is not even close.,0,1
H&M,Shocking customer service,"Shocking customer service, I spoke to 3 different advisors regarding incorrect delivery address (which alone has taken over 2 weeks) - they all advised different things. They were impatient, couldn't provide me with answers to simple questions and were following a very poor system they didn't seem to even understand. There seems to be no communication across the company, from the warehouse to delivery, this all has resulted in multiple calls and both my orders being sent back to the warehouse, now the items are sold out online, i can no longer process them. H&M should be ashamed of their customer service.",0,1
H&M,Order cancelled and still waiting for refund!,"Similar experience to most people on here. I ordered a man‚Äôs hoodie for a birthday present, allowing 4 weeks in light of Covid. The money was taken from my account. After two weeks I received an email saying ‚Äòthe order has been cancelled‚Äô, with no explanation or information about the refund. I then had a long wait on the phone to Customer Services who assured me that the money would be refunded within ‚Äò2-3 days‚Äô. Two weeks later, I still haven‚Äôt received the refund. This is getting really tedious H&M. Customers aren‚Äôt asking the earth in a) wanting to receive their purchase within a reason able timeframe b) effective, timely and accurate communications and c) receiving the refund when you promise to do so. You really do need to review your Ops and ASAP!",0,1
H&M,I would give them 0 if I could!,"I would give them 0 if I could!! The worst system/customer service I have ever encountered! Every time I speak to someone I get told something different!

Two weeks later I‚Äôm now being told it will just have to go to the new family living at my old address 4 hours away And I‚Äôll have to file a missing parcel!?! What!?!?! It‚Äôs not missing!?! I told you two weeks ago wayyyyyyy before it was even packaged it will be going to the wrong address!?! Waste of the couriers time and your money!!

Today first time I hear from them by email telling me my items have been dispatched BUT an item has been cancelled. Pointless having any of it now. Customer services can't help don't know why or who cancelled was told just to re order. Never shopping here again on line or in store,0,1
H&M,Rubbish,"There‚Äôs only so much you can use Covid as an excuse for bad service! I‚Äôm not even bothered about the delay in receiving my order.But when I put my delivery address the website made an error and omitted the first line, I contacted the H&M customer service to rectify this. I‚Äôm told by the adviser that they‚Äôre unable to do this at the point of the order but to call back when it has been shipped because then they‚Äôll be able to do it.I get the shipping confirmation so I call H&M back then they‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it! So why create the expectation that it was an error you could rectify? An error on your end as well?You can‚Äôt call Yodel because of Covid aswell! Unable to contact them online because their operators are busy. These companies are rubbish and it‚Äôs pathetic that they‚Äôre using a pandemic that has cost lives to excuse their rubbish service.",0,1
H&M,Excellent,All of my clothing came in the estimated time period and they responded to my emails. I ordered $500 worth of clothing and everything was in the package. I have never had problems with H&M. People are forgetting that of course service is going to be slower due to Covid-19.,0,5

I understand that these are difficult times, but other companies have managed to get me my orders in less than half the time it has taken for H&M. If they know they are not able to get people their orders on time, just close the webshop, or at least be very clear that you might just as well wait for the physical shops to open because that will be faster. I have not received any mails with updates or excuses for taking so long. I will for sure never buy any clothes from H&M online again, and I will try my hardest not to buy from them ever again. There are other companies who also produce cheap clothes such as C&A and Kappahl and Lindex in Sweden which I will prefer from now on.

H&M,ORDER NOT DISPATCHED AFTER 10 DAYS,I needed few t-shirts for summer as all the stores are closed due to Covid-19.4 Item's and none of them have even been dispatched yet prepared in 10 days. I understand that all the services are overwhelmed with the sudden increase in demand but if you can't cope with it then why put thousands of people in distress? After reading all the comments from people who can't cancel their orders and get a refund I don't know what to do. I will never ever shop again from H&M website as it's clearly a scam for people in need.,0,1

H&M,Never shopping/ordering from H&M again,I am in the same boat as everyone else that is struggling with their horrible customer service! I placed an order in April. I received an email on May 2nd saying they are still working on the order. They refuse to cancel the order even though it hasn‚Äôt shipped. The person I was chatting with kept sending the same response over and over. It said to refuse the package on arrival so it could get sent back and I‚Äôd be issued a refund or I could go in the store and return the items. Umm....EVERYTHING is closed! I know they put a ‚Äúhold‚Äù on your bank when you place an order and then actually charge it when the items ship. Does anyone know if I can tell the bank to block the charge? It‚Äôs $85 worth of close for my toddler. Are they just stealing our money!?,0,1
H&M,"It's been 30 days since I ordered; Package ""In Transit"" for last 2weeks","I gave this two stars because three is average but it's not average for a clothing company to not have your order delivered in a month.

I ordered from them April seventh using klarna 4 payment type deal. order was over a hundred dollars and it says its been ""In Transit"" since two weeks ago. hmm something doesn't seem right here. I also ordered 10 single item packages on April sixteen and those all came within the last three days. So they put the little packages first to ship even if they were ordered recently. maybe I should've ordered them separately to have them delivered already. UPDATE:Just got off the phone call with customer service after waiting on queue for 30 minutes. She created case number for me and will issue refund and says it's possible I may still receive my package. She said since its outside window of time frame of expected delivery a refund will be issued. She said they will investigate with mail carrier to see what is going on with package.

H&M,H&M pants ruin my leg (Do not shop or buy),"I used love H&M until I purchased a pair of pants that ruin my leg (literally destroyed it). The zipper was defective and had one edge that was very sharp which I did not notice until one day I was putting them on and the zipper scraped along my leg. It was painful and got infected. I had to miss work and go to the doctor for tetanus shot as well as medication. Still today I have to buy scar creams to try to reduce the appearance of the scar on my leg and I still experience some pain at times. It looks horrible. The worst part of this is that company ignored the claim I made through their costumer service (which they stated that was the best way). After streaming me along and ignoring me at time (I had to write multiple emails), pretending they were going to do something to make the situation right, nothing happened! They did nothing to help me with the bills or to rectify this wrong. They are dishonest and are a scheme. H&M lends me to believe that I would have been compensated for this wrong and nothing came from it. In the end, after going back and forth, asking for a response after being ignored, they eventually stated that they were not responsible because they got the zipper from China. China? Did I go there to purchase these pants? NO I brought them from H&M and they are responsible for the products they sell. They stated they would send a letter from their CEO with the company's information to solve this. They NEVER did! I kept asking and asking. If I knew better, I would have NEVER shopped here. They are a horrible company that does not treat their customers well. Reconsider shopping elsewhere please. I still have pain and I am paying to care for this injury on my own. They do not care about you! No fashion item is worth this. My leg will NEVER be the same again! I no longer shop at H&M and would not recommend that you do either!",0,1

I honestly love shopping here, but after this hassle of trying to order clothes on your website for 6 whole hours I would much rather just do business elsewhere. I spent all this time, and would of happily spent money here but yet nothing is on the way and now I'm waiting for them to get the pending charge off my card.

For example, when there is a wedding or job interview and I do not want to spend a lot and last year's suits do not close me in the belly anymore. As I told you the clothes are ok but don't wash them ... because you are going to have a garment three sizes bigger than the original one. And you're going to tell me to use a gentle cycle and blah blah blah. That does not matter the clothes go wide and lose part of the intensity of the initial color.

Obviously again, it was due the 'circumstances'. In this conversation I was treated very impolitely, with very arrogant manner. My problem was totally ignored, when I said I am a human being as well, and I need these money ASAP, I got response that this company has workers who are human beings as well.

H&M,Needs Improvement,"I have been an online customer of H&M for six months now, their website is nice and easy to use. Orders arrive on time and you are kept up to date with the status of your order/delivery. You are given a few option of how you can return any items. I have on two occasions needed to return items (as I brought extra sizes to try on) so i went into the Birmingham New Street branch where I was told by the manager that they couldn't do online returns as their systems were playing up. As I was aware Birmingham City Centre have another H&M store in the Bull Ring, I went to that store where I was told by the manager of the Bull Ring branch that their online returns system was playing up but she could do it manually. So I didn't really have to go to another branch as it could have been done manually all along. This just goes to show the different level of service you can get from one branch to another where that really shouldn't be the case. It made me feel the manager at the New Street branch was just lazy, and was not at all interested in providing a high level of service.",0,3

Tracking number doesn't seem to help/work - where exactly is this shipping from and by whom?

H&M,Poor delivery experience,"The quality is pretty poor, we all know and expect that since the prices are too low. My review will be about the whole online delivery experience. I live in Greece and as a person i despise going out shopping so i prefer shopping online. H&M is using ACS Courier for deliveries in my country. This company is completely irresponsible and rude, since they only come knocking on your door once, UNEXPECTED, and then accuse you for not being home for delivery. Then, they make you go downtown to pick up a parcel you have paid door delivery for. With a very short online search, I reach the point that I'm not the only one with this complaint. As it turns out my whole city (Pireaus) is feeling the same way. I tried contacting them about this issue and the only thing they had to say is ""we are sorry about the inconvenience, we've had the same complaint again."" You're welcome, h&m. Never again.",0,1
H&M,My favorite high street store,Online ordering has improved and in-store seems good too. They have some great collaborations with designers and brands. I particularly loved the William Morris collection. Clothes are of fairly good quality given their price.

They always run out of the 14-16 sizes very quickly which is annoying and they do come up small sometimes.,0,4

H&M,Faulty product and bad service from H&M Grafton Centre Cambridge,"Bad product quality. Bought a Cardigan for daugher, found a hole (about half thumb size) in the upper front after only 2 days wear. It looks like that knits were not hooked properly during manufacturing. We went to the store where we originally bought from, H&M in Grafton center, Cambridge. A sales girl was happy for us to exchange. However, the manager (female, around 30) insisted the hole was not at the seam or edge area, so not changable. It was obviously a faulty product, but instead, she asked us to buy a new one, or, she said I could try to exchange it in a different H&M store. How ridiculous! The cardigan was only ¬£7, but the store is now losing its reputation due to selling out faulty product and offering no exchange to a genuine customer.

My order came approximately in 2 days, faster than I thought.From the 5 clothes I ordered I kept only one. H&M clothes tend to be a bit too large for me in M, so that is the main reason. Furthermore, the clothes look better in the store than in real life. One can't also know, are the clothes comfortable (are they itching, etc...).What else to do, the following day I put the clothes to my bad and nose towards the nearest H&M store! The money didn't come back immediately to my bank account, i needed to wait over a long time.Another experience, I bought this shirt but removed the price tag. When I went to return the item, I needed to wait, like, 20 minutes. The salesperson told me to keep it the next time, the returning would be much easier.If you shop in this store, keep the price tag of the item just in case!Also, if you're belonging to the member club, orders over a certain price can be delivered to your front door for free.

I went to return an item bought online to the Wakefield branch where they had to call their manager named Hannah to sort the issue. The manager was extremely rude to me and said that it's not her fault and I should not be ordering from h&m online in future and she is not bothered if I speak to the customer service about her wrong attitude towards a customer.

But after providing her the order #, name and adress, she put my son on hold for another 25mins and she hung up! Never again will order from this company!",0,1
H&M,so apparently if you shopped during black‚Ä¶,"so apparently if you shopped during black Friday your package got ""lost"" so sad.

H&M,Total let down,"I‚Äôve had an account with H&M for years never had a problem but now I‚Äôve tried to order jeans for my sons for over a week now. App is glitchy and keeps coming up cannot complete order and your order has changed. My sons are 15 and 10 and I‚Äôve been buying their jeans from there as long as I can remember! I have all kinds of loyalty rewards and 10% and 25% to redeem but it won‚Äôt let me I have over 1000 points but obviously that counts for nothing, then they say contact klarna (never heard of them before) I‚Äôm seriously considering deleting account and being done with it.",0,1
H&M,I purchased a pair of the twill plaid‚Ä¶,"I purchased a pair of the twill plaid pants online. It took a bit longer to receive them than I expected. But the real problem was one leg was sewn more narrow than the other. I tried to ignore it but the fabric didn‚Äôt give enough to make them comfortable to wear. I took them to the mall for a return stating the flaw. I ended up exchanging them for another pair thinking it was just a mistake, one bad pair slipped through. No big deal. I do not like dressing rooms so when I tried them on at home the second pair had a construction flaw too! Ugh, no way! A leg wasn‚Äôt sewn together evenly so it created a noticeable buckling on the thigh so it wouldn‚Äôt lie smoothly. These were one of the higher priced plaid pants and they can‚Äôt sew the legs right? I‚Äôve never had a problem with pants being sewn wrong from any store. It‚Äôs totally unacceptable H&M. I‚Äôm super bummed because I still want these dumb pants so, as bad as it sounds, I will try more on in store until I find one correctly constructed. I also bought a T-shirt there once at shrunk up in cold water and no dryer. Figure that one out.",0,2

I tried to return them in store but was told I had to send them in the post. What???? When the items are actually in store why can‚Äôt they process my return?? Now I have to forego $5 to send them back. In this era of online ordering!? Antiquated, not consumer focused and downright inconvenient. I will not be ordering from H&M again. What chain store doesn‚Äôt offer in store returns? Ludicrous.",0,2
H&M,Horrible service,"Ordered Dec.2 , shipped Dec13 and will arrive Dec 23 which is too late for my Xmas gift!!!! Horrible service! The worst is that they post online that you can order till Dec 16 and still get it in time for xmas. What a joke!!! Will never buy here again . Big disappointment",0,1

Chat function didn't work, the phone line had an over 20 min wait, and it took forever to find an email address. This online shopping service is horrendous. I will never order online from them again. In an age of online ordering, this company is behind the times and missing the boat. DON'T ORDER ONLINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,1
H&M,False advertising and lying,"False advertising regarding the shipment timings for a gift card.Ordered a gift card for Christmas on the Italian website. There was NOTHING that said delays or order too late for Christmas.. And it is honestly a piece of plastic so I thought it will be fairly quick to order. I received the confirmation email saying my gift card will be sent in 5/7 working days.After 9 working days I send and email and they told me that the delivery time is 7/15 working days (NOT as advertised!!) because the card comes from the Uk?? But i ordered from H&m italy, does not make any sense!Replied to them and I received another email with another lie... Now they don't mention anymore that the card come from UK, but they told me that there are delays ""because of the busy season and sales""... Which is 100% another lie, as I ordered on the 3rd of December especially to avoid sales and Christmas rush shopping!!So basically you are misleading people with the shipment time and then you are lying twice regarding the reason of the delays!! Last time I buy from them!!!",0,1
H&M,Worst customer service / lied about ship time,Ordered a gift card. It said 1-3 business days. I emailed 5 times. Called 7. Spoke to an online rep only to find out it takes 9-10 days to process first. Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced. I will not shop here again.,0,1

After another 2 phone calls Thursday and today I was told it was the couriers fault, H&M failed to follow it up, the items are now out of stock, would I like to order them again at the full price! No I would not. I WILL NOT BE SHOPPING WITH H&M EVER AGAIN!!!",0,1
H&M,UPDATE : ORDERED ON NOV 28,Update to previous review hopefully it helps. I called HM today 12/15 and the customer service representative said that it‚Äôs safe to say my order was lost if shipping information hasn‚Äôt been updated since the 28th.

H&M,Awful,This has been a terrible experience. I cannot connect to customer service and when I tried chatting online the person said my package has been lost.

H&M,To all the people upset I‚Äôm in the same‚Ä¶,To all the people upset I‚Äôm in the same boat but the packages will likely come I got through to customer service and they said they had an over flux of orders and after two weeks you‚Äôll get the refund so those who ordered during the Black Friday week end by Monday everyone should be able to ask for their money back. And they will return it no problem and they said they will honor the sale if you wanted to order something else. The shipping company they used newgistics is backed up and most likely out packages are stuck in that warehouse. Idk if the stuff will get here by Christmas but it‚Äôs unlikely everything was lost. So I hope that gives everyone hope,0,2

I‚Äôm just hoping my order will show up before the new year. I love their items, especially the jewelry. The items have never been an issue for me. They also have the best sweaters. Sweaters that are actually thick and heavy. I would prefer to shop here for work clothes more than anything else. Their outerwear is always super nice too! But under any circumstances-DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. Visiting their store is much more satisfying because you actually walk out with your item in hand and most importantly, on time üòÇ. I‚Äôm hoping to receive my coat before spring.Update 12/17/19: received my package today. They sent it via ups next day air saver. The urgency was greatly appreciated. A paid return label was also included, I‚Äôm assuming this was a courtesy due to how late I‚Äôm receiving the item, (ordered around 12/7/19). I ended up keeping the item. Fit great and looked wonderful. I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend ordering from their website during major sales, which sucks because then you miss out on items that may not be in stores. However, having a paid return label is great and I‚Äôm actually surprised that they included that with my item. I only hope others will receive the same.",0,3
H&M,2 Weeks and nothing!,Ordered my package November 29th and selected the free shipping for orders over $40 that was 4-5 day shipping.

Today is the 9th day and I called to be told it would arrive by 9pm...no delivery. To make it worse, I was unaware that this morning they refunded my entire order....I only noticed after they wiped it back out my account leaving me with no money as I didn‚Äôt see the refund so incorrectly thought I had more available funds.

He also said the call recordings are going to Sweden and they don't have access to it. Yet at the beginning of the call, it states its for training purposes. Yet its only for GDPR reasons according to him. They need to not say its for training because its obviously not used for training, noting from the way this guy was over the phone. This person should not be answering the phones and frustrate a customer even more instead of thanking them for waiting or shopping with u and just get to the point of answering questions.

H&M,Awful,"I‚Äôve ordered 3 times from H&M and only on one occasion had a good experience.First time I ordered my order was cancelled without any explanation and no alert to say it had been cancelled and I only found out when I looked on the tracking. I called customer services and they said that one of the items was faulty so the whole order was cancelled, which doesn‚Äôt make sense why not just cancel that item and send the rest?? Anyway they then said they could re order it and when I asked if I would be charged again they told me I would but the money I had already spent would be refunded but this could take days to be put back in my account (I think order was about ¬£150 -¬£200) at this point I told them not to bother and just refund my money.I decided to give them another try and everything went well and I got my order when it said I would.I recently ordered again on Thursday and put next day delivery as this was the only day I was guaranteed to be in all day. When I looked on tracking yesterday it said my parcel had been delayed and it could take 24hrs to ‚Äòbe back on the move‚Äô so I called customer service and they couldn‚Äôt explain why and just said they would raise an investigation. I changed my plans So I‚Äôd be at home today and looking at the tracking my parcel still isn‚Äôt doing anything so once again I contacted customer service who have now told me that my parcel was sent to the wrong depot and that I could expect it to be delivered Tuesday at the latest and that they have refunded my postage fee. When I explained why I ordered for next day delivery and that I won‚Äôt be in (because of work) all I got was sorry and nothing else. I really like H&M but their online service and delivery service (Hermes) is absolutely awful. I will now no longer order from them online which is a shame as most of my shopping is online due to work and other commitments.",0,1
H&M,Poor communication and absolutely no customer service,"In a day where many of our well known retailers are going out of business, I would have thought that the bosses of H&M would take more notice of the terrible reviews I have just read on line.Sadly I have just fallen victim to their terrible service and despite being one of my favourite stores, I would be hesitant in giving them my money again .I placed an on line order with them for several items to be delivered to my local store.They took payment instantly but did not send a confirmation of my order.I then received a text two days later saying my items had been delivered to a different store 15 miles away !.Upon querying this with customer services I was told they didn‚Äôt deliver to the store I had selected from their delivery options !!.I requested for them to be sent to my home address instead ( I would have been happy to pay delivery rather than drive 15 miles with a baby in tow ) to be told they couldn‚Äôt do that and could only refund !.Absolutely appalling service H&M !",0,1

BUZZARD. what type of customer service is this. i did not receive my package and have to wait nearly two weeks to open a postal investigation. Walmart has better customer service than this. i would never place an order with H&M . the manager could not even speak clearly and kept repeating herself.,0,1
H&M,Awful customer services!,It is now 11/18 and I have been waiting for a reply from H&M customer services since 11/2 regarding an error they made on 10/11 when they charged me again instead of refunding me for a return I made to a Chicago store. Thankfully I noticed it and returned to the store to ask them to rectify their mistake. This took a good 20 minutes as they couldn‚Äôt override the system and had to do it all over manually again. Needless to say when I saw the returns there was a small difference remaining and I called customer services. I had to call them 3 times and email them all of my receipts and screenshots of the transactions. This was on 10/31. I got a response a few days later that had nothing to do with the information I had sent. So again I called and spoke to customer services for 50 minutes. This was on 11/2. How long does it take to check one single case that I have had to chase up on at least 4 times and never once got an apology. I am just glad I noticed the mistake. Having lived in the US for nearly 2 years now I have never come across such bad customer service and it‚Äôs a pity because H&M has very good customer service in Europe!,0,1

H&M,worse than useless,I have been a mailorder customer of H&M for about 5yrs and until recently had a great experience. occassionally order items went on backorder but not enough to be an issue. Recently returned items and paid the balance but then got a demand for what is member discount of ¬£3.89 that H&M have wrongly removed. Their online customer chat wasn't available several times I tried and I refuse to pay 35p per minute from my mobile to phone. Then I got a late payment charge of ¬£7 so wrote to them explaining that my account has been settled in full. Nothing. Now I have another ¬£7 charge and a threat to involve debt collectors. It's ridiculous. Reading the other recent reviews is cold comfort but seems H&M have lost the plot entirely and I'm hugely disappointed. Oh. and I asked for my account to be closed.,0,1

This is a nightmare because every single time I've got an issue with them I have to seek them to get my refunds done ore wherever it is, missed items, unexpected items, wrong sizes... and now wrong partial refunds ... AS I SAID LAST TIME ORDERING WITH HM , it is a pitty they are trying to get more clients with Designer collaborations instead of caring their customers or maybe get more people well paid at the warehouse, with the Rana Plaza incident sure things are not working inside this company...One proof is that mostly of companies are replying trust pilot comments ""like"" they care about their feedbacks but hm never reply any of them.. shame",1,1

H&M,Oxford Circus London Resembles Abandoned City,"Walking into Oxford Circus H & M is like walking into an abandoned city. Although you are told tills are on all of the three floors, the experience is that of walking into an abandoned city. Except the ground floor, staff is no where to be seen on most of the floors. You ended up running up and down the floors looking for someone to help you and there you eventually find them, two people on the till on the ground floor. I wonder where they are hiding? -Playing hide and seek whilst shopping is a time-wasting stressful experience. This is extraordinary since H&M has the best spot in London, pity for H&M sales. Don't dare to ask for help when you do meet an assistant suddenly, you will end up feeling treated like 'how dare you?' We are busy, doing the hide and seek. . .",0,1
H&M,Disastrous experience,"I have ordered the blazer for the Giambattista Valli collection four subsequent times with no luck with either of the orders. The first time I ordered was on the day of the launch, at 9.26 am (launch was at 9am). I do not believe these were sold out yet. I then received an email stating that my order had been cancelled. The reason was not specified and no apology was given. I log onto the website and the item is still available for purchase. I try to order again, my order gets cancelled again. The same happens two more times. I am absolutely appalled by this and do not for the life of me understand what is going on, as the item is still available to buy. This was the first time in years that I ordered from H&M but needless to say, it will be the last, as the service is disappointing and an absolute waste of time. I would have liked to be offered at least an explanation of what happened with my four orders.",0,1

Nobody was able to help me because I didn‚Äôt have the receipt. The manager that I dealt with in store as well as online was completely incompetent and could not care less about helping me. It‚Äôs very unfortunate that after having so many negative reviews, they would change their policy. I will gladly stop shopping at H&M permanently. I would much rather spend more money and have a proper customer service and I would rather support a store that has a proper exchange/refund policy. Terrible!",0,1

This is coming from someone who is a size 0/1. Based on their chart, I would be closest to a 0 and the size zeros were so small/ tight. This time around, I sized up based on recommendations and those ran small. The XXS tops I bought felt 2-3 sizes too big. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I fell in love with H&M‚Äôs clothes, but at this point, I am being sold a fantasy. The obvious attempt at trying to silence people (removing reviews) says a lot.

I expected a no hassle exchange from the Heartland location however was advised no receipt no service from us and call the 1800 # to complain. So I called and spoke to the gentleman who was the manager. He unfortunately had little or no concern for my situation and told me he could not help me. We are now stuck with pants that do not fit my son!!! I have never written a review but felt compelled to reach out due to the service i received. By the way tags and labels were all intact on pants and gift was given less then 30 days ago. UNACCEPTABLE SERVICE!!!,0,1
H&M,Awful sizes and cheap quality,"Ive been looking for a good pair of Baggy Highwaisted Mom Jeans for ages now and when i found some on H&M, i didnt hesitate to buy them. On the model it look Baggy and said it was a loose fit. Im a solid size 18 and sometimes 16. I decided to get a size 20 so that it could be baggy and loose like i wanted. They have just come today and look awful. First of all i cant even zip it up, Its tugging at my leg so i cant sit down. Second even if it did fit me it looks nothing like the photo. Its cheap quality and is just regular skinny jeans. Also there is nothing high waisted about it, it comes up to the bottom of my belly button. Im sitting here feeling pretty bad about myself, If you are very small and skinny then buy at H&M as much as you want, but if you're over size 10 dont even think about it. I got a printed t-shirt as well and its just as bad. Its very cheap and see through, Capatailism at its best i guess. Anyway i wont be buying here again.",0,1

And no, they will definitely not cover even the costs caused to me from phoning them and having to wait for half an hour for the lady to find out nothing. Needless to say this is at least my 20th experience like this with this company. I don't even know why they have customer service, since they never help you to the slightest there, and even worse: they don't even want to help. Please avoid this company at all costs.

H&M,WHY? just why?,"I ordered 8 items on Saturday and asked for cash on delivery - it said that will take 2-4 working days for the items to arrive, I checked on Monday and Tuesday the status and saw that the items didn't leave the warehouse and today (Wed.) they send me an email saying that my order got cancelled because one or more than one of my items are not available. I checked again on the website the items for my measurements and they're all there, but they preferred to cancel all of them without a logical explanation.WHY?Is it because I didn't payed upfront and they couldn't block my money on false claim that the items got stuck somewhere?WHY?",0,1

I tried to pay by credit card twice on 2 different terminals. Both times I entered my pin and the transaction seemed to go through but the till froze. The staff assured me that neither transaction had gone through, so I ended up paying cash. I've since checked my credit card and can see that actually, the money WAS taken from my account each time.",0,1
H&M,Would give this a 0/5 but it won‚Äôt let‚Ä¶,Would give this a 0/5 but it won‚Äôt let me. Probably the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received. I ordered a sweater online and was very excited when it came in the mail. Opened the package to see a windbreaker instead of my sweater. I called customer service about the error and they told me their warehouse had messed up the order and I would have to send the item I was sent back in the mail and wait for them to receive the windbreaker to be credited back for something I did not receive. This was an error on H&M‚Äôs end why make the customer suffer?? Awesome customer service as you portrayed on your phone call would have been to send me my sweater right away and politely ask me to return the windbreaker to a store. Instead I have to waste my time sending this windbreaker back. Will not be shopping here again.,0,1

I used the online chat and the agent informed that there was an issue with the system updating from processing to shipped. On my app I had no tracking information for a few days but the agent was able to let me know that my item had shipped and was in transit. He provided me tracking information and my item came within two days after that. I'm not sure what agents they had or if these people are unaware of processing time and shipping times during the week or weekends with the postal service, but shipping isn't anything to complain about within four days if you didn't pay for expedited. Any item from H&M takes 5-7 BUSINESS DAYS to be received at your place of delivery. If there's no item after a week I would then contact H&M. Otherwise within four days? Seriously, have some patience.",0,5
H&M,Don‚Äôt buy online if you want to receive your order!,I ordered one item online which was due 25/09 I‚Äôve called three times now as it‚Äôs 29/09 and still haven‚Äôt revived my item. On the 25/08 I received an email confirming my delivery had arrived and been put through my letter box. That hadn‚Äôt happened. I spoke to three different people each saying they were waiting to hear back from the courier and to wait 24 hours as they were investigating what had happened. I now don‚Äôt even want the item but they won‚Äôt give me a refund until they‚Äôve finished investigating. My advice is to never order online with H&M if you want the item to turn up!,0,1
H&M,Worse online experience ever,"I wouldn't even give their service one star. I'm not usually one to write reviews but something needs to happen with this company. I ordered ONE item from their site. ONE. That was on 09/17 I recieved an email on 09/18 saying that it had been shipped out. Well today is 09/26 and my package hasn't updated from ""In Transit."" I have spoken to 3 different people. The first one told me that they might not have scanned my package and that's probably why I'm not see any updates. That's the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Okay, so I went to the USPS sight with the tracking and it said that they were still waiting on the sender for my package. The next person I spoke to said that my package may be lost but I'd have to wait until the 2nd to have them file a ""missing package report."" I was also told that I would have to wait until the 2nd to be issued any kind of return if I wanted it. Are you kidding? This company is a joke. It may seem tempting to buy from them but don't.

That was rude!!!That is not the way you treat your customers.It's a fitting room etiquette to put all the clothes we tried and not buying back on hanger but not checking each and every dress is put straight.As far as the customer is not leaving a heap of clothes in the fitting room, it should not be a matter of botheration.",0,2

H&M,I've never been so disgusted with a corporation's customer service.,"As someone who has been shopping with this company for many years, it was a top of mind brand when the Director of my workplace asked me to style our company photoshoot.I combed through the website to find the perfect pieces and added them to my cart. At least 4 times I could not complete my transactions. Each time I contacted customer service I got another reason as to why. Each time I took their advice (make an account, call your bank, use a different card, break your transaction into multiple orders...) I was met with the same backlash. Finally, someone from H&M was able to process my over $1200 order. When I made my next order for $800 and then another for $200 - I again was met with the same difficulties. Continuously, I was made to feel as though it was somehow my fault. Finally, my orders were processed. Two weeks later, as I hadn't received that combined $1000 order, I decided to follow up with Canada Post (the delivery service used). I was asked to verify my address, and then told that was not the address the items had been shipped to. Again, I called H&M customer service. The rep told me, they ""had a labelling issue and that the items were being returned to the warehouse"". When I asked when I would expect the items, she told me, ""by the end of the week"". At the end of the week, I called again. This time, the rep told me that any items shipped back to the warehouse won't be sent back to me. When I asked her to check my account, she told me Canada Post was holding the items at their location and I'd need to go pick it up. I contacted Canada Post and they told me I needed to verify the address that the items were sent to. AGAIN, I called H&M and the rep told me, ""whatever the address on your account says"". When I explained that H&M shipped it to the wrong address, I was told, ""well I don't know what address it was shipped to"". I asked to be put through to someone who could give me that information and was met with, ""I'll put you through to my supervisor but you'll probably get the same answer"". She then sung a little song before putting me on hold. I had to call back before I was told what address H&M had shipped my $1000 worth of clothing to. Again, made to feel like this was my fault. In the end, Canada Post will not release my items since my ID won't match the address on the box. I've never been so disgusted with a corporation's customer service.",0,1

It was being displayed with a t-shirt underneath, so it would not have mattered aesthetically.I was going on holiday the next day, so would have loved to have taken the shirt with me. Meanwhile, I was told to try another branch, to see if they had my size!! Why should I do that, when they had my size right in front of me!

H&M,You Need a New IT Department,"Listen, I like H&M. I think their clothing is great. They have fairly accurate sizing, the patterns are interesting and on trend, and the stores are welcoming and fun. HOWEVER, the website is an entirely different story, at least with my experience with the US site. Whoever is running that IT department needs to really get their head in the game, and someone needs to work on the emailing system for order numbers/tracking. I went into my local store to return a shirt that was a little too small, and asked if they could order me the correct size. The associates did not have any access to order me something from their own company, so I ordered it myself. My card was charged, everything was fine so I let it go like I usually do with online orders. Almost five days go by, and I didn't receive a tracking number. I paid my money, so when was I getting my shirt? Now I'm fairly tech savy- it's my major- so I figured I'd just check the site and see if I could find a way to search my order number. After having a ridiculous run around with the Customer Service tab, I realised they do not have a direct email contact. I decided to go to the chat bot. The chat bot continued to send me back to the page I was one, which did not resolve my issue, until I requested an agent multiple times. It was then I was given tracking information and found out my package is coming today???? And the agent was able to pull this up in about ten minutes and send me on my way. Does this mean I will stop shopping here? No. But you can sure as hell believe I will be shopping in store only from now on; if you don't have my size, guess I'm not buying.",0,1

Meanwhile, they were available at the site (I mean that's why I could order them in the first place).They totally ruined a whole outfit and I was not even informed beforehand about ths cancellation.

I have done the same procedure dozens of times, and it was always like that. I trusted them, as we normally do. The blazer I returned cost DKK 799. It shows in my account in the app that I returned it, but the money never came to my bank account. Now, they say I exchanged the blazer for something else, what is a huge lie. First, in their own system it says I returned it. Second, they don't accept you to exchange products bought online in the physical store. At least here in Fredericia, you have to return the product and buy what ever else you want in another kvittering. So, even if I wanted to get something else, I couldn't just exchange, as they say I did. Now, their law department is ""analysing my case to see if something can be done"". DKK 799 that I will probably never see again. You have just lost a very loyal customer, H&M. Being dishonest is the last resource of incompetent management.",0,1

H&M,Very low quality of attention to detail for customers purchasing,"Very low quality of customer service. The staff do not care about attention to detail .Stratford Westfield shopping centre store is appalling staff.I bought items and twice I asked to ensure the security tag taken off.Was reassured by cashier staff at till when I purchased.Also by security guard after my items beeped in the bag when i left store and I asked him again.He said no it was him beeping as he had a tag on his key ring. I got home and all my items had tags on. I had a interview the next day and the store was closed by the time I got home. I've no time to go back before the interview to get the security tags removed. I was intending to wear the items to the interview.Also the cost to travel back to ask for the tag to be taken off will be ¬£6 . The store has cost additional funds and also wasted my time to have to return. Due to the cashier not paying any attention to remove tags, which they are trained to do .!!",0,1
H&M,By far the worst service I have‚Ä¶,"By far the worst service I have received from h&m and the delivery company Yodal. I ordered my parcel over 7 days ago and was emailed that i missed my delivery. So i stayed home the following day (didnt work!!) and received another email saying ‚Äúsorry we missed you‚Äù. I called customer services at h&m and told them yodal was lying. Long story story short, 3 days later i still didnt get my parcel and was home. Apparently they tried to deliver it and failed to do so and took my parcel back to the warehouse. I called h&m and they were unable to locate it. Not only did did i not get my items an important event, i was told i NEVER will and they will now refund me as its gone to the warehouse. I would recommend not ordering from h&m until they have changed their delivery service. I am a loyal customer and have done multiple transactions with them both instore and online. Really let down that im told i wont get my package ever and will just get a refund. Thanks!!",0,1

H&M,I would not buy from H&M,"H&M uses Yodel company for shipping their products to online customers.

H&M,"Never go to the H& M store at kaufingerstr.18 , Munich.","This incident happened at around 6pm on 26th June 2019. I was holding more than 10 clothes in my hand. I didn't find the shopping bag, probably it was only in the entrance of the store. I was entering this store for the first time in germany since I jus shifted to germany couple of months ago. In India and Dubai , where I lived before, you will find the shopping bag in the middle of the store. So apparently we customers were supposed to carry just 7 clothes to the trial room, since I didn't have a shopping bag with me, when my turn came , I just kept those clothes on the desk where the staff will be standing , thinking I am supposed to give the clothes to her and pick 7 clothes from that and go to the trial room, but the staff there was so rude and arrogant, she started to yell at me saying you can carry only 7 items and I am working here , and she told me remove the clothes from there. I asked her ,ok what am I supposed to do with rest of the clothes , where am I supposed to keep it, but she was so rude and acting like she has problem with me, not even ready to listen to me, just yelling at me saying I am working here. She wasn't letting me speak too. Then I saw a shopping bag next to her, asked to give that, she was like ,I don't have a shopping bag initially, then I looked at it, immediately she was took that passed it on to me, she didn't even give me a minute to put those clothes into the shopping bag, she again started yelling at me saying i am working remove the clothes from there infront of more than 10 people. And then I had to sit on the food and put those clothes into the shopping bag and then I told her I picked 7 and where do I keep this, she again started commanding me saying get all the hangers along with the tops after you try, I was like I don't have the hangers , she was like where did the hangers go, I said I removed , she was like why, so I said few hangers which I had i kept on the desk, then she was making faces. She was literally treating me like as she owns me. She was talking to others very nicely. I was the only 1 with brown skin there. I feel she is a racist. She doesn't even know me, how can she just bounce on me and start treating me like that. She has no rights to yell at customers like that. I was almost in tears. I just left everything there and walked away. Never experienced such issues in my whole life. Just because she was elderly person, I didn't back answer or questioned her anything. That doesn't mean she takes advantage of that and yell at me like that. Never experienced such issues at all in Dubai or India, the staffs there were very friendly and helpful.",0,1

I work in the same mall as a manager at another store and went in last week just look for dresses for a few bridal showers and weddings coming up this summer. I had just gotten out of work, ran in and started checking out there ""sale"" items... Don't even get me started on the terrible marketing they have. I was in a big hurry since I still needed to get my son from daycare.. I checked out buying 9 items. Unfortunately didn't have time to try them on so ended up returning 4 of the items 2 days later.. I'd like to quickly throw in that I've worked in retail for 14yrs and that over the years I've dealt with some truly horrible customers so I'm extra polite, understanding and patient with other stores after I go In them. Fast forward 2 days later and I get up to the cashier and during the 8min transaction I had either her returning 4 items, the only thing I got from her during this entire duration was ""do you have a return"" and ""you can insert your card for a refund "" ? After her first question she then proceeded to take the 4 items and lay them out on the counter, making sure they hadn't been worn ( I get that) But what I don't get is why on earth she then proceeded to hang and sensor these items before she would issue a refund.. in the 14 yrs of my retail experience had I had someboy to take the time to do that even though I just bought 2 days prior, tags were attached and I had my receipt.. Needless to say, after receiving 0 customer service and dealing with that, I won't be shopping again at h&m... ever. Again.",0,1

Some things have been preserved, some have long been thrown out. Recently, I have been shopping mostly online, less often in an offline store.

H&M,David has NO CHILL and needs to be held accountable for his NASTINESS,"I purchased a backpack from H&M a few weeks back. One of the zippers broker the first day and the second one broke about a week later. Due to my work schedule of two jobs, I wasn‚Äôt able to exchange it when the first zipper broke but when the second zipper broke, I didn't have a choice. I called customer service first and told them I just wanted an exchange and wouldn't be able to go all the way home to get the receipt. I was assured that an even exchange would be absolutely no issue and I proceeded directly to the Galleria at Sunset Mall in Las Vegas where I made the original purchase. I had the misfortune of being assisted by David whom had the nastiest attitude and some of the worst service I received and I felt it was very unnecessary. First of all, even though I was highly frustrated, my initial greeting to him was upbeat and cheerful. I always do this intentionally because I want things to go smoothly. David did not reciprocate my energy. In fact he was incredibly combative immediately. I explained to him that I just wanted to exchange and showed him that I couldn't close the backpack which was full of my daily items. Mind you, I had walked from my job to the mall with a backpack that would not fully zip. What I was trying to explain to him was I needed to get another bag and I didn't want my personal items strewn on the counter. Good customer service would have been showing me where the options for other backpacks are but he just pulled out a shopping bag and slapped it on the counter and waved towards where the bags were. I forgot to mention that the first thing he said to me was that I couldn't get cash back and where is my receipt and that they don't look up receipts by the card used. I never asked for cash back so to me that information was unnecessary. The real issue to me was when I became frustrated and let out a deep sight and perhaps a slight eye roll he has the sheer audacity to say to ME, a longtime customer and grown grown adult, ""you don't have to roll your eyes."" That is when all bets were off. I do not care what the circumstances are, I will not be chastised as if I am a child by any individual with whom I am spending money or by ANYONE period. He then proceeded to continue to attempt to provoke me by becoming less helpful, more combative and continuing to respond back to everything I said. I am not his child nor was I acting like one and I do not have to be subjected to that type of service. This occurred in front of numerous other customers and store associates. I need H&M to understand that none of their customers of any age comes in to their store to be belittled, humiliated and spoken to condescendingly by any of your associates especially when the reason for my return visit was due to your faulty product. David at Galleria at Sunset was completely out of line and your management and your customers need to be made aware that this type of interaction is unwarranted and unacceptable. I will post this on as many review sites as I can and share this experience with my large worldwide circle of influence. Thank you.",0,1

H&M,Another example of rip off Britain,"I have shopped in H&M stores for many years, I like the products on the whole particularly the kids range. However, absolutely shocked and disgusted to be charged 5p for a paper bag today in a UK branch. A paper bag should be free, the charge should only apply to plastic bags. H&M is taking advantage of the law that was brought in for plastic bags to penalise its customers perhaps to increase its profits? Apparently, according to H&M on twitter, that any money they get from bags they will donate to UNICEF. Do I really believe the entire 5p goes to UNIICEF - NO I DON‚ÄôT! If H&M wants to donate to UNICEF, very commendable but it should do it from its profits not by applying a surcharge to its loyal customers. Customers should be allowed to donate at their discretion and not dictated by a large multi-national.Another excellent example of rip off Britain, in this case by a multi-national H&M that is out of touch with its customers. Take note H&M - Debenhams and House of Frasers were also charging for paper bags, look what happened to them!!This particular loyal customer, will take her purchasing power elsewhere where the law is not manipulated to suite its shareholders.",0,1

H&M,Number 2,So I hope that H&M see this because the need to restock the girls side because it is all pink and there are no other colours so I have to buy all my stuff from the boys section and I do not like doing that because the boys have all the colours including pink so I am wondering why the girls only have pink white purple and that is it .This is my second review and I have gone to H&M and nothing has happened so I am going to keep writing until something happens.,0,1

H&M,I do not think HM will survive,"I do not think HM will survive. We all now that they are struggling at the moment and can not compete with other (online) stores. I bought a soap dispenser from HM and after one time falling in the sink (not even so hard) it completely broke down. I then found out that it was made of very thin glass, and certainly a soap dispenser should not break that fast. The worst thing was that there were a couple of very visible deep marks on the sink which were caused by the broken glass. I emailed all the evidence and the customer service claimed that there was no damage at all!? Like I was lying to them. It is still an ongoing case and I am waiting for a solution. It took me already a long time for them to refund me the faulty item. I had to send 8 emails, they called me for verification and had to send all the information over and over again. After that, I also had to call them again since my payment info expired so I had to call them to give them my bank account details, so they could issue the refund. I would not recommend anyone to buy from H&M since if there is something wrong with the item it is a very long and cumbersome process. H&M can do better, I believe that. I hope they will solve the case, so that I am willing to update my review.",0,1

H&M,Dire customer services,"24 hour delivery not received with no information why. Customer services were supposed to phone back twice with info, but didn't.

After more complaints from me H&M agreed to refund when the courier confirmed they had sent the goods back to H&M. After more complaints from me to a supervisor they issued the refund straight away. Poor delivery.

Even if the item is damaged you must pay the 5$ return fee. I think it's a very silly policy considering h&m is a huge company with many store locations. Also the sizing at h&m is very inconsistent, so to not allow customers to exchange sizes free of the return fee is a little insane. H&M need to up their game.",0,1

Why would you spend thousands of dollars on high exclusive cloth brands that look like garbage when you can get a full wardrobe with the money if you choose to buy from H&M.H&M is great for countries that are not doing so well economically because you can buy nice clothes at an outrageously cheap price and look fresh as hell.From my point, you're doing a great job by simply letting people with a low-income dressing sharp and not force them to pay hundreds of dollars on extremely over-priced clothes.",0,5

H&M,H&M (near where you cross in Oxford Street),"Honestly, H&M is a difficult one to rate. It has got five stores with jam-packed stuff but yet I do not think it has the quality of Reserved or even Matalan (check my previous reviews).For a woman, it would be a very good shop to be as it is pretty much women focused with most of the store being based on women products. But in fairness with the amount of products they sell and me not actually giving H&M a full lengthy look, they do sell a few too many jumpers. Matalan in Oxford Street (check previous review) has already started their summer range (writing this after Christmas and before the New Year) which was the reason which decided me to give Matalan a four. Yet it seems to look like that H&M are still on the winter stuff which is not propelling them forward. It looks like H&M are a company who have put a lot of investment into the store yet they are not showing their perfection. Not much to it to be honest. I would probably say my local H&M with two floors has more fire towards it.There are not many positives and not many negatives; it's just pretty average and basic; not much to write either.....",0,3

H&M,Same Day Delivery Policy (small print),"The customer service I've just received on seeking a refund on delivery costs after same-day delivery item failed to be delivered on the same day, was appalling. I opted for 'same day' delivery as I needed items to be delivered on the same day. It is not made clear anywhere on the H&M website that the cut-off point for same day delivery on a Saturday is 10am - important information that is confined to small print. I called H&M customer services on the basis that it is very misleading to customers that the same-day delivery option is displayed as available despite it not being valid after a particular point in the day. I have visited countless store websites which make it very clear to customers what delivery options are/are not available, and it is very easy to do so. From the start of the conversation with the H&M customer service representative, she stated that a refund would not be issued; she was very rude in manner and showed no empathy whatsoever with my plight. It is not simply enough training advisers to say 'I understand where customers are coming from', if the way that they say this is not genuine at all but instead abrupt, rude and insincere. No effort was shown to appease the situation or at the very least refund the delivery fee in part.Disgusting customer services; I will not be shopping with H&M again. What's more I will spread the word to family and friends.Dr Yvonne Robinson",0,1

I'm so sorry I didn't get the young man's name- he is an employee of the finest calibre, and at the busiest time of year( for both staff and shoppers), he was exemplary...Although his advice (rightly) led to my not overspending today, I would much rather that than to have to come back and return products...

The material around the poppers was not secure or stitched properly and now there are frayed holes along the neckline of the coat and a useless hood with both halves of the poppers attached.

H&M,DO NOT ORDER ONLINE,"DO NOT ORDER ONLINE! The store will not accept the return if you order online. Apparently their computers won‚Äôt allow it. It‚Äôs 2018 H&M programmers, get with it. How can your computers not be linked? Instead, you have to return the item by mail and they will deduct $4.99 before they refund you your money. Also, be aware that you ONLY HAVE 30 DAYS to return your item. I ordered some pants in different colours to be sent to my daughter who is going to university in Montreal. Her birthday was November 3, and she received the parcel a day or two in advance (to be opened on her birthday). She chose which colour she wanted, and then brought me the other two pairs when she came back to Ontario December 1st so that I could return the unwanted colours. Past 30 days, no returns. I am boycotting H&M. They have to realize that, in this day and age, customer service makes the world go around. Their service is terrible.",0,1

H&M,Honest review from Singapore customer,"Honest review from Singapore customer. I managed to order 2 H&M Moschino items(1 down jacket and 1 ear ring) in 2 different transactions on the same date. The ear ring was received promptly but the jacket never made it. Status was in transit and sudddenly 20 days later H&M sent me an email saying my down jacket has been returned to their depot, they refunded my money within 2 working days.Main thing is I never even initiate the returns nor did I receive any letter/parcel on behalf of their courier company! The item u turn by itself to the depot? Their customer service guy was totally not helpful. When I probe further, he still have the cheek to say that reason of return was ""unclaimed parcel"" according to the courier company, however my H&M tracking status shows in transit. Because of this I need to scramble to buy another jacket elsewhere for my Europe trip. Never mind the inconvenience but I still want to buy the same item (since I am a supporter for Moschino and they auto resent it back to depot, I assume the item is physically available for me again). Not sure how they are going to make it up for me and to make the arrangement to re-purchase the item again or even perhaps give me the same item free of charge?Will amend to give better review if they make efforts to rectify the situation else my 1 star will stay.",1,1

I understand it's holiday and I'm in no rush to get the items, but even amazon has already sent me an email that my item was shipped. I dont understand why they would offer live chats when I was asked to why I need to speak to an assistant? All I wanted to know, is where is my package or what's the status?

H&M,The worst online shopping experience ever,"The worst online experience I've ever had. First of all, I ordered my clothes 12 days before any Black Friday sales even began. The website was down intermittently over the course of the next 2 weeks and the first time I tried to place my order they had my size in stock, the next time (after waiting hours for the website to come back up) they were out of my size for one of the items. I went ahead and placed the order anyway as I can make the size up work I think. It shipped a couple days later, but it has now been 12 days and I have no idea where my package is; there is literally no tracking info on WHERE the package is. It just says ""Parcel in terminal handling"", etc. No idea where it shipped from either, you have to use H&M's tracking service, they don't use UPS or anything, it is their own service! If my package does not arrive today I'm going to have to return it which will probably be a further nightmare but I want a refund at this point. Please avoid buying anything at H&M online if you want to save days of frustration. Clothes are over-priced anyway, look into Zara when items are on sale there.",0,1

There is no cancellation option for orders that haven't been processed and the return of items is a hassle, unless you take them to your nearest shop, which for me is about 40kms drive. The point of ordering online is that they have products which aren't available in the shops. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother!!",0,2

However, when I re-ordered and bought another item which I then returned, I was charged the return fee of 4.99. Given how many other cloths retailers do not charge a return fee, I am disappointed. I often do returns for orders from other stores directly in the closest store next time I am in the mall. This type of return is not available at H&M and, not having that option, you are still charged a return fee!?!?... I will not shop on-line anymore from them.

There were issues with the website which made using it very frustrating, but eventually I ordered a mix of sale and non-sale items and order was accepted , but a few days later the order was shipped to store without the main non-sale item that I had gone to the website to buy in the first place. Notification came that the item was missing at the same time as the dispatch email which was no help whatsoever.. I then got an email to say the order was in store. I was not given a chance to cancel this order before dispatch but it was not worth the journey to collect it if all items were not there as I would have to find the missing item elsewhere. .It would take me two hours to get to the store and back so I notified customer services that I wished to cancel and asked for a refund. They said they had had issues with the website so their stock numbers were not updated, hence the missing item , but I was not offered an immediate refund even though the probllem had been theirs. I would not have placed the order in the first place without this item included! Instead of apologising and giving me a refund for the items I had paid for, I had to wait until the time they keep the order in store had elapsed, the order was returned to the warehouse and a refund was processed. I have only just had notification the refund has been paid but now it will take time for my bank to process it, in all it will have been around two weeks before this happens! Why they could not have notified me prior to dispatch the item was missing and given me the option of cancelling the whole order or given me a refund immediately I notified them I did not want the incomplete order, I do not know. Failing that they could at least contacted the store and got the parcel returned sooner so my refund could have been processed earlier but, despite my asking several times in emails, they never gave me a reason.

The front pockets are ""fake,"" except the little 5th pocket, but I don't mind that, and am used to that with ""jeggings."" These are very ""skinny"" cut and make my legs look super slim and I love that. They also make the legs appear much longer, and I always receive compliments when I wear these jeans! I also like the light blue color...it's slightly bright. What I don't like, is that the zipper comes down 95 percent of the time. My midsection is bigger than my legs, so I presume it's because they are very high-waisted, which I love, but it may be because the zipper has longer to ""travel"" than on mid/low waisted jeans, and because the fabric is so lightweight and it is tighter there, so it's more ""stretched,"" but it's not /that/ tight. I have other tight-fitting pants from other companies but the zipper stays ""locked,"" regardless of the fit. So that is my only complaint. I like everything else about them. I just have to wear long shirts in case I have a zipper incident.",0,3

Hannah noticed us browsing and said hello and asked if she could help at all? My partner was greatful for the assistance and another female perspective on the garment she was trying on. Hannah unfortunately for my wallet was very helpful, and suggested accompanying garments which my partner decided to also purchase. Hannah also mentioned to us about your loyalty card which I normally wouldn't entertain, however Hannah put it across in a very positive and none pushy way. We would have taken her up on it had it not been for the behaviour of another colleague or possibly manager?! I believe his name was Jamie? Whilst Hannah and my partner were discussing outfits I overheard him using unprofessional language (swearing) on your shop floor. I couldn't believe someone who looked like they are meant to be leading others would actually behave in such away, nor expect to hear such foul language in a family orientated shopping environment! Hannah was very much an ambassador for your brand and customer service, as much as this Jamie was brand damaging. Maybe you could swap their roles?! I hope that the thanks from myself and my partner make their way back to Hannah, as a great evening was had and my better half received some nice compliments on her new outfit. Also maybe someone could review the so called managerial behaviours of select members of your team?

H&M,Bad Business,"After attempting to purchase a gift card online for my son, the site told me that they were unable to process my credit card at this time. I almost refreshed the page and attempted the purchase again, but something told me to check my bank account. Sure enough $100 had been deducted from my account, but no confirmation email for the purchase. I did an online chat only to be told the hundred dollars would ‚Äúdrop off‚Äù in 3 to 5 days. Also I should try to make the purchase again. Do you think I want to lose another $100? Also, as I explained to her, my sons birthday is today and I should be able to purchase an e-card and have it delivered immediately. She said she understood and if I talk to a manager they would tell me the same thing. Give me that option to talk to the manager and see what they say, but she would not she told me to call the toll-free number. I told her she was rude and to do better with her next customer. Their customer service is terrible, and it is unfortunate especially since my kids love H&M. They better hope that $100 is back in my account in 3 to 5 days. Don‚Äôt use H&M online.

H&M,Beware of H&M policies and customer servic3e,"I purchased clothing for my 16 year old son and the pants did not fit. He left them on the counter for me with instructions to get a larger size but lost the receipt. I brought them into the store to try to exchange them for a larger size and the manager indicated that if I did not have a receipt, there was nothing they could do. All of the tags were still on them, including the price tag and they were obviously unworn but she refused to even look at them or offer any suggestions. I called the customer service line. After keeping me on the phone for 24 minutes ""logging"" my complaint, the attendant told me I could have asked her to look up my credit card in the system to find the receipt. I asked why the manager did not offer this solution. He said he did not know, so I indicated to him, that it was not going to be a pleasant experience if I just went in and asked the already unhelpful manager to do this when she already didn't want to do anything to assist her customer. Then he indicated that maybe I could wait to get my credit card bill and try to take that in to show her. I became angry that I was on the phone for 24 minutes before these ideas were even generated and told them that there was a very easy, common sense solution - I was standing outside the store as I did this, all I wanted to do was exchange some pants! He transferred me to his manager. The manager then told me that in fact, the store cannot look up my credit card. I asked, why would they suggest this if it wasn't true? He said he didn't know, he would speak with this employee. I asked what they could do about my situation, he said ""we can't really do anything. It's a strict policy in Canada and it's up to the store manager. "" I asked - so you are willing to alienate a customer over a very simple issue of an exchange? He said there was nothing he could do about it. I asked him if I could speak to his manager. He said he was the highest ranking empoloyee I could speak to in the company. No one above him would speak to me and that his manager was only there for his personal development. CAn you imagine that? I apparently spoke to the highest ranking individual at H&M (an obvious lie) and they couldn't do ANYTHING for me. Now I have two pairs of unworn jeans (only worth $50 buck each but still!) and a very sour taste for the complete incommpetency of H&M. Think twice before shopping there! The customer service engine is clearly only on autopilot and has no common sense....",0,1

Also stop labelling clothes XS, S, M, L, XL please, it tells you nothing about actual size considering H&M doesn‚Äôt have a size guide for that.Clothing sizes are all over the place, some fit perfectly, same size different item fits horribly. I bought a S top and it was huge, not loose fitting just like a sack. Got another top in 14 and it was tight. Very rarely get to buy my actual size from H&M because they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. On a positive note they appear to have sorted out their shipping issue.

They told me it is an internal computer generated block to prevent transactions from certain accounts and implied it was to prevent fraud. I was so appalled as this suggests H&M are treating my transactions as fraudulent and there is nothing they can do to override this glitch - even though my bank confirms there are no issues from their side. They said there are no fraudulent flags for my card or address and said that they have had other customers experiencing the same issue with H&M!! The person I spoke with at H&M customer services was lovely and said she wished she could help me as it was so obviously a computer generated error. But it's a case of the computer system getting it wrong and humans not being able to tell the computer what to do!!! Ridiculous.

H&M,Accused of fraud,"Visited my local H&M to return some items from an online order. Assistant was part way through issuing a refund when we realised I had not signed my bank card (new card). Alternative ID was requested but unfortunately I did not have this with me. The manager asked me to log into my Facebook account to verify my identity, so I showed her my phone logged into Facebook. She then said this was accepted and I could have a refund, where upon the assistant said to me that she needed to be sure that I wasn't 'trying to commit fraud'. I was shocked by this accusation and I asked her did she think that this was what I was trying to do, incase i had misunderstood what she had said. she then repeated again that she needed to be sure that I wasn't trying to commit fraud. I told her I was offended that this had been said to me, the manager then declared that I wasn't going to be served. I had no option but to take my items and leave the store. I contacted head office about my experience and received an email back apologising to me for being asked by them to view my Facebook profile, and that the staff are now aware to not ask for this as a way to verify identity. I feel that the issue of the assistant accusing me of fraud in front of a shop full of customers was not addressed, or the embarrassment I felt at the time has been given any proper thought. I was calm and asked the assistant to explain what she meant, where upon I was immediately refused service. I felt victimised and bullied by these 2 members of staff who stood there behind the till in front of my 9 year old daughter and other customers and accused me of fraud.I would have been happy to return at another time with ID. Instead I was accused of fraud and then demanded that I leave when in my only defense simply asked her to explain what she meant.",0,1

The pricing can range from average to slightly more expensive but never overly so.

Not an isolated incident as we had two employees attempt this, different devices/locations, with similar results.

Not only is it a huge inconvenience but I am forced to pay $5 shipping on each order. I do lots of online shopping and have NEVER encountered such a horrible policy. So I re-ordered the clothes in small but they still haven't even shipped my order and its been 5 days!! Plus the shipping is the slowest I've encountered. I want to make sure that the new items fit before I send the old ones back but if I wait I might miss the 30 day because they have to receive the items within 30 days of the order date NOT the date you receive it even though it takes like 2 weeks to receive you order not to mention the time it takes to send it back.Furthermore, there were a number of items that I was soooo excited to get and yet they were not shipped with my order...they were ""cancelled"" items. However, I went online and they were still listed as in stock items so I don't see why they would have been cancelled. Plus I find their stores very inconsistent. I have found items that are on sale in one store but then not in another location. Also, sometimes things are like 70% off online but then full price in the store...it's very frustrating.

I call and email customer service, they didn't mention anything for refund or help me to look at missing package. so I call customer service again, they told me I have to wait another 14 days from the shipping date to get the refund. I feel really frustrated that I couldn't get my refund right away, they might just take away my money. I have to wait another 14 days to ask for refund and I am not sure if they are trustful. I never buying clothing online within Canada retail store have to wait more than a month to get my shipment. I will not use online shopping from H&M again. it is terrible",0,1

After calling customer services I was told that it was because it was now out of stock in my size, despite the website STILL saying that it was in stock and allowing me to purchase another if I wanted to. The lady I spoke to said it sometimes takes the warehouse a while to update it.

I suppose I should be happy it isn't taking up to 6 months like the other reviews I've read. theyre constantly out of stock, and once you're finally able to place an order when they restock it takes forever- probably because they haven't actually restocked.

I have received no item but they took my money and will NOT return it. I have emailed constantly since april and to no avail have gotten anywhere. They deny taking money from my account which i have proof from my bank. There an absolute disgrace! I would ask people not to shop or be caught by a company that threat people like this!,0,1
H&M,"What has happened to HM.com, ruined..","What has happened to HM.com -Norway? I have been a loyal customer to online shopping with HM for over a decade. First I will say that 10 years ago, the quality of material, fabrics and sewing was so much better..The last couple of years, the customer service has really declined. The last year, it's been a disaster. I can not shop with them anymore. They are not answering e-mails at all. They are rude on the phone. They always make mistakes with returns, adding extra fees and so on. They split returns that was sent as one parcel into multiple returns, just to add multiple return fees.. After they changed to the new website, there has been an extreme delay in order delivery and even more for returns. The returns now takes weeks to get a credit for. And they don't show the orders and returned items on the ""my site"" either, so it's harder to keep track of what you've ordered and returned. There must be a change in owners and manger in the HM company. They want to make money, but not please the customers.I can see they even manged to shut down Trustpilot page of HM.no‚Ä¶Just one advise: Stay away from this company!",0,1

H&M,First and last time H&M customer.,"First and LAST time H&M customer! I have never had so many problems with any online company. Shopping with H&M has been a mess from the start. SO many things wrong that I will summarize here:- An item I wanted to exchange was no longer online. I called to see if any stores had it. The customer service representative gave me the lamest excuse for why they couldn't check store inventory: ""It would take too long for an associate to hunt down a discontinued item in the store, even if they have it."" Unbelievable. So you aren't going to make an effort?- They don't list their ACTUAL store numbers on Google OR in the mall directory. They just give the same 800 number. I can't even speak to anyone at the closest store.- Their 25% off plus free shipping code for signing up for the newsletter didn't work.- I placed a NEW order after the first one, which I shouldn't have done. It was ""in progress"" for 12 days and I got the package 16 days after ordering.- Earlier on when I called H&M to cancel this order, because it was obviously taking too long, the customer service representative said I couldn't cancel even though it had NOT shipped. That doesn't make sense to me. If nothing has left the warehouse, why can't you simply terminate the order?- When I finally got the order, one item was not included because it was out of stock. I now have a useless bikini bottom to send back (and lose $6 on return shipping for). It was part of a matching set so I can't wear it.- They send pointless emails saying ""GET EXCITED!"" for your order, without reporting any progress. Useless, and just makes me more annoyed...It has been about a month of dealing with H&M -- bad customer service, wondering where my orders were, worrying about my refunds, missing items -- yeah, no thanks. I get the sense they don't know what they are doing, not keeping inventory, or something else. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm not shopping with H&M again.",0,1

We paid the outstanding balance on the 12th june but because the payment did not process straight away we were still charged 7. They felt justified in this because they still we owed the amount from march. Charging 7 on 8.74 is a large charge so people be warned when using the pay later option on h and m website!,0,3

Then they told me that there was an old unsettled debt (not true! has been paid right away! also back in the day not ordered by myself, anyway.....) So they decided to run a CREDIT CHECK!! My order was ALREADY PAID!!! THIS is even against their own T&Cs. Then I have asked them to send me my data, so far nothing received except promotions.

H&M,Pathetic Customer Service - Extremely ANGRY,"The Customer service received from H&M is pathetic!! Yesterday, Sunday, 10 June 2018, the Cavendish store did not have the size of the Chino pants that i wanted to exchange for my son, the sale floor lady contacted v&a waterfront store for us, and they advice they have 2 pants left in the size i want. my husband rushes of to v&a, since we need this pants for Eid. My husband goes to the kids section and fetches the right size .The lady that assists my husbands does the exchange, she changes it on the system and issues a new receipt and we leave to go home. Last night i take the pants out the bag , to see it the same pants, we initially took the first time THAT NEEDED to BE exchange, and not the right size my husband when to go fetch, I was furious, we drove around the peninsula for this pants, and to come home with the wrong size again. My husband calls the store this morning, the lady he spoke to gave no apology whatsoever, and said that there is nothing they can do if we want the pants we must come back again. My husband asked if they can send it to canal walk store, he works close-by, for him to collect in the week they said they cant do it if we need it so badly we should come to waterfront to fetch. He then asked if she could please check if they still have the size we want and let him know before 12, so that he can leave during his lunch time to collect, she replies that she cannot promise this it wont happen so quick, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS????!!! The mistake lies with H&M AND NOT US, yet they cant assist us with a proper apology. I am furious, IT IS NOW 13.45 PM STILL NO REPLY FROM THEM. This will be last time i am supporting this Clothing brand",0,1

I tweeted every single day asking when he/she would reply and with snark, said for me to be patient. Meanwhile, they were clearly online and tweeting others, just not replying to me. Whomever runs your Twitter account needs to be let go!! Worst customer service experience ever and very disappointing considering we buy most of our clothes from them with our H&M account.P.S. I am editing to add that I waited THREE weeks for 3 packages that were supposed to take 3-5 days!! Not only that, when the last of the 3 packages finally arrived, an item was missing yet it was on the invoice! Honestly, I can forgive this because I truly am a loyal customer and they are not usually so disorganized with shipping, but I was counting on good customer service, especially on social media where the whole world is watching. What a shame I was forced to leave such a negative review. I really hope H&M takes this seriously.",0,1

I call back after standing there for a while, and the driver tells me he has posted it through ‚Äòthe letterbox‚Äô. Upon checking, there is NO PACKAGE in the letterbox. Are they out of their mind?! H&M suspiciously has no contact number to call addressing the issue with their chosen courier. I paid H&M and therefore it is their responsibility to ensure I receive the item they promised to deliver. Any problems with HERMES should be addressed as the fact that you are receiving money for an exchange of goods; when there is no goods is the textbook definition of a SCAM.",0,1

Also when I contact them just with a simple question or query they come back to me swiftly with a positive decision and some reward or discount.I‚Äôve been shopping around online and came to conclusion that H&M is the only decent retailer out there. Never have I ever had a problem with them, with their products, returns or refunds. Everything done easily and swiftly.And by the way I have recently dealt with some returns etc with other retailers. No thank you. I‚Äôm sticking with H&M.H&M, I appreciate you!Stay that way please",0,5

Ever since they have revamped their website it is not working properly. For example if you sort clothing on sort by 'lowest price' and you click on an item but want to go back you will have to sort the page again to 'lowest price'. As a person who wants to shop quickly I have not time to keep clicking on sort on lowest price all the time if I want to go back to the previous page. So annoying. Also, when I added items in my basked and clicked on checkout in a sudden it said basket is empty!!! Really? After I spent an hour on your website!

H&M,Dreadful click & collect,"I ordered two pairs of shoes on line, with click and collect, as they weren't available to purchase in store. It was probably my fault that I didn't check all of the details really thoroughly as I put in my postcode, as requested, and believed that the items would be delivered to my nearest store which is in Reading. Now Reading is a large town but no, later on I found that the shoes were being delivered to Oxford. Miles and miles away!!! When I phoned Customer Services to ask what on earth ...they said oh, you could have them delivered to London. What kind of click and collect is that? When nearly every major town in the country has an H&M store why do they expect the customer to drive for over an hour to collect the goods. They said ""but you can have them delivered"", yes, but at a charge. Anyway, I had to ask Customer Services (on Friday) to cancel the order which came to just under ¬£100 and they said they'd arrange for Hermes Courier service to collect the shoes from the store in Oxford (on Monday) and they would be returned to the warehouse and then I would be notified of the return and refunded. Today, Friday, having heard nothing, I phoned Customer Services who said the shoes were still waiting to be collected, as far as they knew, but they had no way of tracking the courier who was supposed to have collected them on Monday and that I might have to wait up to 14 days before hearing about a refund. What kind of service is that? Who expects to have to wait for 14 days to get a refund? Will definitely not order from H&M online again. If I'd read all the bad reviews beforehand, which I didn't, I wouldn't have ordered from them in the first place. You can, apparently, return any ordered items to any store in the UK but they only deliver click and collect to a handful of stores throughout the country ?????

This company promised delivery in 2-3 days, but only on the fourth day after me paying I received the shipping confirmation from H&M and from this time my parcel was ""in transport"" another 5 days. I received the trousers in 9 days instead 2-3 like H&M promise. Trousers don't match size and the photo absolutely. H&M service is very poor and don't uphold their promises. H&M has broken my trust to internet shopping",0,1

They asked her to leave even when she was standing outside the room. They also asked me to get the tried out clothes outside rudely.

H&M,Cheap clothes and horrible customer‚Ä¶,"Cheap clothes and horrible customer service! My 20 year old son bought his own clothes at the H&M store a few weeks ago, spent $100 and every single shirt shrunk to the size of a 10 year old boy. I felt bad. No tags, and I didn't think they would take them back knowing they had been washed. So I reordered everything two sizes bigger and had it delivered to his dorm room at college. I started tracking the order until it arrived at the post office in his City. When he didn't receive it 5 days later, I tracked it again and found out it had left and was returned to the H&M Distribution Center! I immediately called H&M customer service who was of no help at all. All she did was read the message that they didn't have access to deliver it. She couldn't explain what that meant. It's a famous college campus, I'm sure they deliver there every single day! She offered nothing but to wait until I get refunded and I could call back and reorder everything. Are you kidding? She heard how upset I was and how inconvenienced we were and didn't even offer a small voucher to reorder again. I told her forget it, I would never buy another thing from that store again.

H&M,RIP OFF AND RETURNS ARE A TRAP,"I bought 4 pairs of same type of pants I already had that I bought from them and exactly the same size. They did not fit, too tight. I bought them on sale at $20 per pair. I went to exchange them, receipt on hand, prior to the 30 day period. According to the cash register guy, I had to pay the difference in price bc I had bought them on sale and the sale had passed. More or less he said that that was the policy. I did not want different type or reference; I wanted the same type of pants, same color I had purchased but a little bigger. No use. On top of it, the idiot who sold rang them for me at the rehister on the initial date of purchase added an additional pair to the purchase that I never got, apparently a pair of gray pants, same type I had bought but that I never even grabbed. Long story short, I had to return the pants ang got less money than I paid because according to the receipt, I had purchased a gray pair of pants in addition to the other 4 pairs. Beware, this chain stores are cheap when it comes to proce but its customer service & return policy sucks. I got ripped off. I sirely will do my shopping elsewhere next time.",0,1
H&M,One of most famous brand and one of the worst online shop ever at the same time,"How the hell is possible to be that much unfunctional eshop while nowdays there is thousands of small eshops with perfect customer services even with one day delivery and lot of them even fo FREE delivery! How can H&M dare as a global brand with central branch in every single country even provide this online service when they are absolutely not able to make properly order in 8 days and at the same time be so brash to make this service charged (much more than other eshops). In this servis you basically cannot see any humanity, because everyhing is operated over automatic answers (even customer service) so you never know if you just haven't threw your money through the window, because nobody knows where your order is or when it's coming... I'm so dissapointed... So welcome in 2018, grab your f*ckin' online shop, hold hands with your customer service and collectively jump to lava. Loosers. H&M CZ",0,1

What is worse is that H&M fully acknowledge the problem, have a ""work around"" (Whcih is unsucceful, as i've not received two parcels), to solve it, and set a high expectation that the customer call their customer service team. I think it's a disaterous website, they've launched their ""H&M Club,"" with free shipping, and utalising one of the worst couriers (Hermes). Hermes claimed to deliver my parcel - but actually dumped it somewhere (or stole it, it contained back and forth tracking information, as the address did not contain a flat number or house name where could they have delivered it too?) and I am still waiting a refund? Outrageous. Sadly, the CS team are also very clueless, even though I was reassured three times that they've contacted hermes, to correct my address, it clearly did not treackle through their workflow. What a joke.",0,1

Very unhelpful, very unprofessional, very poor, very disappointing. The way of their communication is very close to some sort of a scam website. It takes already 1 month to get a very simple refund from the goods they have never delivered (as they cancel my transaction however still took the money from the account). In that 1 month I have talked to at least 6 of their employees, without any help. They always promise the money has been sent, in couple of days I find out it hasn¬¥t. Lies, lies, lies.

I checked my credit card and it showed that the payment went through. I've never received any kind of confirmation e-mail ever since. I called Customer Service, instead of waiting for an e-mail back. After a 10-15 mins waiting time on a Tuesday night, the guy on the phone told me there was no order made related to my H&M account and that I would have to wait at least 24h for a refund on my credit card. I asked him if it was possible to keep the charges and actually process my original order without having to be charged again (or risking to be wrongly charged twice). He said that it was not possible without charging me again.Very stressful and frustrating. I really wanted those items but I don't want to risk having to go through this ever again.

I called customer service and the first representative I spoke with admitted he too could not find where it was stated that the item was final sale until having to speak to his supervisor. If someone who works for H & M can't easily find information like this how is it fair or informative to the buyer? The worst part of my experience was speaking to the ONLY supervisor/manager apparently in the USA that could help me with this issue. Brittany from Chicago's called center response - "" return the items to the warehouse, you might get a refund, if not they'll return it back"" So basically I have to take an additional hour of my day to return an item via UPS after already trying to return it to the store.

I don't understand, it's not about $ 5.99, it's a matter of respect and common sense, anyway that was my last purchase.",0,2
H&M,Very disappointed.,"Dear H&M.I am usually a big fan of you. But...In the last couple years I have handed in a lot of clothes for #hmconscious and received 15% vouchers in return. I have used these vouchers on items already on sale so many times and it has never been an issue before. However, suddenly it is (at least in Holstebro, Denmark?).Your employees now tell me that all these times it has been a mistake made by them/you - and I have been able to do this in Holstebro, √Örhus, Herning, K√∏benhavn, etc. 50+ times. My mom and several people we know have also been able to do this countless times with no issue.Furthermore, I was told by an employee that you gain ""nothing"" from the clothes that are handed in - and in fact it is a huge hassle and a profit loss for you to even transport it to wherever you need it to go.Then WHY do you want us to hand in our old clothes? Why do you give us vouchers for it if it is nothing but a huge problem and a loss for you? Which clothes do you use for your Conscious brand? And why is it suddenly such a big problem that I want to use my vouchers on items already on sale?",0,1
H&M,headache,h&m has the worst shipping system ever. it takes entirely too long! by the time you get a valid tracking number your items have already arrived. customer service is terrible. they know absolutely nothing and this is not just during xmas season. i hadn‚Äôt got a valid tracking # in 5 days and when I called i was told ‚Äúwell if it doesn‚Äôt come in 2 wks we‚Äôll refund you.‚Äù It should NOT take 3 wks to receive merchandise. then when i asked how long it takes to receive tracking i was told ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have it before the item is delivered.‚Äù that wasn‚Äôt my question.

H&M,Not Trust any more. You can't rely you will receive what you ordered.,Bought some present online 9 days ago. Just today 21st of December received an email saying that they cancelled my order. How can it be? What kind of company communicates this after 9 days of the purchase? What kind of system do they have set up...definitely they have a problem. You can't trust at all that you will receive what you ordered. What . they show on the website is what they should have in availability...should not be that difficult.,0,1
H&M,Unmitigated disaster with their ‚Ä¶,Unmitigated disaster with their customer service for online. Their IT systems are coded by amateurs causing all sorts of errors and duplicate orders then trying to sort that out is a joke. 6 reps have separately now emailed but I can't follow up with any of them as they don't give me a case reference or way to follow up with an individual that I have already explained the situation to. So every day I get a new name email asking me to explain the problem once more despite replying with ATTN to xyz in the email subject. They say they don't have access to online orders on their system so it has to be submitted to IT for review which involved phonetically spelling out everything in some long form. Whoever designed this department procedure is an idiot and needs to be sacked. I feel sorry for people who have to work under incompetent management.,0,1

H&M,They are a horrible company,"They are a horrible company. I bought online and I bought the wrong size. I understood I made the mistake so I had my husband drive an hour away to the closest store to go exchange the items for a bigger size. Big thank you for him doIng this for me. My husband stated he went to the store asked for help to get the correct size I needed and one of the retailers went to the back to go grab the right size. She came back with the stuff and another retailer rang it up. My husband trusting that they knew they grabbed the right items left the store. Keep in mind we had everything we needed according to store policy exchange, packaging slip/receipt. So the bar codes should match or if they don‚Äôt should be verified that the products are the same so they are not giving away something of more value. I guess their retailers don‚Äôt care because they gave him the wrong merchandise without doing any of those things. I wanted to exchange a bralette for a bigger size they gave my husband a bra. The difference between the two is a bralette is a lacy version of a sports bra with no back or front hooks. Granted human error always happens but when a consumer tried to fix their mistake by going an hour away to the nearest store then H&M should try to fix their mistake. I called their customer service and they said I had to go back to the store to exchange it for the right item, after explaining it was an hour away and we shouldn‚Äôt have to do that if it was now their mistake. The customer service lady said I could buy another bralette or go back to the store. She gave me no other solution to fix the problem but to inconvenience me the consumer. I work in a business where business satisfaction is of utmost importance even if the customer is completely wrong so when you get a customer who tried to fix their mistake properly and your retailer messed up then you should go out the way to find a solution. H&M should not try to further inconvenience a consumer or cost them more money.",1,1

H&M,Apparently H&M love feedback,"Apparently H&M love feedback , so here is mine! After years of shopping with H&M, and thinking what a fab store it is... I am finally moving on and finishing my shopping experience with them. Today I received a reminder to pay notice which looked suspiciously large, when I looked into it, it seems that H&M have been charging me ¬£7 overdue fee since August with no letter of reminder or even emails. I normally pay all my invoices immediately and yes there is the odd time where I miss the deadline but I then pay immediately if I know about it! I looked at my account online and it doesn't even jump out at you here that there is money overdue, I took this up with customer service, after being kept on the phone for the best part of 45 minutes I was then told I had to prove I wasn't getting any of their emails and letters? ( I searched my emails , spam and other inboxes there are none) At this point I feel that I am no longer dealing with a company who cares about customer service! They didn't care that I had had no notification, they didn't look back at all over my past history of payments to them , just no sorry you have to prove that you are correct and they are wrong. Sorry but in my book they are now just another faceless big organisation that doesn't want to trust their customers and can't even be bothered to help them and don't care. I run my own business and have to say if I treated my customers like this, I wouldn't be doing well. After years of shopping with H&M ( since the 80's) I am finished with shopping here, sad!!!",0,1
H&M,"Well, well, well...","Well, well, well, not a lot of people are happy with H&M. To be honest I'm not surprised. I feel like I smile more in the store than its employees do. Although, I do frequent the store right around lunch time, so maybe many are just hungry and waiting for their break. Either way, every time I peruse the store, I rarely buy anything, and when I do, it's because it was on sale. Although--no, that is a blatant lie. I recently purchased something that wasn't on sale. It was this fluffy jacket seemingly made out of a comforter. It's huge, very large, big. My mother laughed at me when I put it on, and I think that made me want to buy it even more (that and I'm terrible with my money, the coat was $79.99). But man is it so very comfortable. I literally use it as a blanket too. I'm honestly just waiting for winter so I can wear it out without looking so extra. But I digress. In my experience, H&M has been fine. I go in, get what I need little interaction with the cashiers and go home. It's not my go to place, if that's the question, but oh man...That coat though.Cheers!",0,4

My neighbour was though. The smart smart driver who was delivering my clothing items thought it would clearly be a fantastic idea, that, instead of leaving them with my neighbour or trying to deliver, he/she would CHUCK my parcel over my 7ft fence (it may be higher than this) into my back garden where we have had some lovely rain spells and are also doing a lot of work too it, meaning there‚Äôs mud every where.Lucky my items of clothing are fine despite landing in a lovely muddy puddle but don‚Äôt use a service that don‚Äôt give a damn about your products or customer care because eventually your customers will stop giving a damn about you.",0,2

H&M,I am H&M customer for about 10 years,"I am H&M customer for about 10 years . I have tried most of H&M ranges such as : DIVIDED , L.o.g.g., basic , premium quality, maternity and the regular ladies one. It's hard for me to review in a few lines since I am such a big fan of H&M I could talk for hours. Starting with quality I would say that find it pretty good ( always depending on the material you buy - for instance a fine knit should get treated as a sensitive piece of clothing to last long) and I still own clothes that I bought ten years ago believe it or not . Sizes are fair in general and true. Of course there are lines that are a bit more tight and some others a bit more loose, this depends mostly on the design and the style of each garment ( if you do online shopping at H&M you can find the description of each item which usually explains it ) What I love the most about H&M is that refers to a huge audience from the newborn to the older people , having clothes for all tastes and occasions always in affordable prices. Talking about prices now , when there are sales you can go frenzy on shopping .. tops from 2¬£ crazy isn't it ? I got a dress online the other time among other items and it was 2,69¬£ I didn't expect much before I get it , but when I did oh dear it was amazing . Once you get used to the sizes you can buy online so easy . I'm size 10 and 99%of the times clothes fit me perfectly as it would be if I tried them on in a local store . It's been a year I turned to online shopping mostly because of lack of free time and I assure I never faced any inconvenience with delivery service or customer service so far . I'm sorry to read that other people do :( it's bad and annoying and they have all my compassion for that .Five star ain't enough to rate my beloved brand Keep the great job",1,5
H&M,Shopped in-store for decades,"I've regularly shopped at the physical locations for over a decade so I was very excited when their online shopping launched. I ordered a basic pair of slip-on shoes from the Women's shoes section. I had purchased two pairs of similar shoes in-store before so I was confident that a size 6 would fit me. When I received the package, the shoes were extremely big - like almost an inch larger than all of my other size 6 shoes. Obviously they were men's or unisex sizing but someone had failed to make that clear on the website. I contacted customer service and their response was that I ordered a size 6, and got a size 6. Uh - THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. Either their customer service team is run by idiots or they just don't care to really listen to and solve customer issues. What makes it worse is that you can't return or exchange items in-stores, and you have to pay for shipping to do it online, so it's really a whole nightmare unless you know EXACTLY what you're ordering. After a few more exchanges of emails they finally said they would pay for the return shipping. What a headache. After this incident, I rarely step inside their stores anymore.

I have been charged 813 dkk for something I never recieved and nobody can tell me where the package is.I would also like to point out that H&M did not bother answering a single complaint here. While Bestseller has answered ever single complaint on their behalf. I think it shows very well how much H&M cares about its customers.",0,1
H&M,Dysfunctional customer service,"Very disorganised/dysfunctional customer service. A nightmare. I¬¥m still waiting to receive my products. The customer service people I spoke to (about 5 of them) were mainly nice, but consistently made mistakes which caused me a lot of wasted time, mainly waiting on hold to talk to them, and consequently Im still waiting on the products I ordered with ""express/1 day delivery service, a week ago.",0,1
H&M,The crappiest customer service ever!,"Ordered something for a wedding, since the shipment time is 3-5 days. This is now 14 days ago, and nothing has appeared. Tried to get in contact with customer service several times, the only reply is 'it's on its way' and 'we can't do anything'. Not really in need for the clothes anymore, since I couldn't wear them to the wedding, so I'll have to go directly to a store and return them if my package ever shows up! Going on vacation in a couple of days, who knows if it arrives and then lets see if I'm able to pick it up and return it within the limited dates you can return the clothes.. Money out of the window! Never buying anything online with H&M again!",0,1
H&M,Love this company.,Website is clear and easy to use. Customer Service is available from 8am-9pm if you have any queries. They're always helpful and nice to speak too. Been shopping online with them for years.,0,5
H&M,Just don't do it!,"Honestly one of the worst online shopping experiences ever. Took forever to arrive, my return took forever to come though. I got charged a late payment fee incorrectly and the man at customer services was rude and useless. Never shopping with them online again.",0,1
H&M,Bad managing,"I popped in to h and m today (Cambridge U.K.) city centre and was appalled to see the manager glare at her staff members, pull her over and slam a phone down to show her how to sign off the tannoy! She didn't say hi or say could you just make sure you put the receiver down on the tannoy from now on, she was so rude and I walked up to tell her how rude she had been to her hard working member of staff in front of customers. She shrugged me of and simply said 'ok'. Her staff member said nothing but you could see she was quite shocked at being spoken /treated like that and it got her down. I simply told her to keep her chin up and she has been lovely to me! Bad management has nothing to do with it- being nice to other human beings is all it requires. I would feel very unappreciated if this had been me. Not acceptable. I'd love to know the manager in store on 8th July 2017 and make an official complaint against her. Tall, about 5'10/6ft, dark hair up in a bun and white shirt on. Very rude and couldn't care less about her customers opinions or her staffs feelings.",1,1
H&M,One of the worst online shopping ‚Ä¶,"One of the worst online shopping experiences ever! The website is an absolute joke! First order I have placed, nobody knows what has happened to it and the payment was taken (issue still unresolved). With the second order in the same day it took me several times to place it using different browsers and devices. After all that hassle they took my payment twice. You cannot even complete the survey as an error appeared afterwards. So so bad. Extremely painful and unpleasant experience. I will never use them again!",0,1
H&M,ONLINE SHOPPERS BEWARE!,"Despite how negative reviews for online shopping at H&M, I decided to give it a try (foolish of me). I figured if I paid for express shipping, all these delivery problems would be avoided. WRONG! H&M couldn‚Äôt get it right‚ÄîI paid for express, yet the website said I had to wait an entire week! I did NOT just pay 25 dollars for one day shipping to wait a WEEK!",0,1
H&M,Rude staff,"Rude staff. I went to the h and m Hounslow on this Saturday to return stuff. I am a new mum hence was not organised as always and couldn't find the receipt in my bag. It took me around 50 seconds to locate the receipt in my bag for which I apologised twice in that time to the staff who was serving me. Instead of calming me down and empathising with me not able to find the receipt, the staff did not reply and also gave me a rude stare. I can't believe what's going on in this world where people have no Sense of patience and humbleness. I felt really bad. The guy who served me was skinny and had blonde hair. He wore specs and was serving at ladies till in h and m Hounslow at 3:30 on 25th June Saturday. Then a lady came to finish the transaction. Black hair, dark lipstick and she wore specs too. I apologised to her too, again no response and she passed a mocking smile to her skinny colleague. Thanks h and m you made my day (sarcastic)",0,1
H&M,I am sick and tired of wasting money...,"I am sick and tired of wasting money buying clothes online at H&M. They are sized INCORRECTLY. As a small size 12 , i ordered size 14 shorts because I am well experienced in the inaccuracy and dishonestly of them sizing clothes wrongly , and I could barely squeeze into them ! I'm seriously done- don't buy cloths online , try them on and go 2 sizes up. Ridiculous.",1,1
H&M,Probably the worst online experience ‚Ä¶,"Probably the worst online experience I've ever had. For a brand with so many parent companies attatced to it, including COS and MONKI, you would think they'd have perfected the service of their original company before creating others. I tried placing one order 5 different times all week before it finally went through. I'm going on holiday so I ordered around ¬£300 worth of holiday stuff that was supposed to be delivered 4 days ago. Of course H&M use the worst delivery service, Hermes who didn't deliver my item. I received no notification, no email, phone call or text despite them insisting on having every single contact detail of mine possible. After calling H&M I was told an IT fault ended up changing the first line of my address so all the delivery man had was my street name and post code. They assured me, they had contacted Hermes who will be arranging a redelivery. When? Who knows. They can't be sure, they said. I leave for my holiday tonight and have spent all day running around frantically trying to buy whatever I can with what little money I have left after H&M happily took my ¬£300 and left me without my items.",1,1
H&M,Terrible!,"I placed an order with H&M for four items. I recieved one item that was compleatly different and shirt that was two sizes smaller. Without noticing the size of the shirt initially, I tried it on. When I realized is much smaller I tried to get out, however bright mark of foundation was left on the neckline. When I tried to return the shirt, the terrible so called store ""manager"" told me: ""I cannot sell this again! No refund!"". She didnt even wanted to award me me a partial refund for the mistake that was intially made by them! Terrible service, terrible experience! My advice is to avoid purchasing from the online store if you want to avoid headaches!",1,1
H&M,Worst customer care ever,"I placed an online order from H&M. This order consisted of only 4 items, all of which were similar. When I received the order, one item was missing and I had two of another. I promptly contacted H&M to inform them of their mistake. I first contacted them via telephone. I was on hold approximately 12 minutes waiting to be connected to a customer service agent. Once I was connected to an agent, I explained THEIR mistake. I was told I could ship the shirt back to them, once received they wld ship out the correct one or credit back my card. However, shipping wld be at MY expense. I told them, again, this was not my mistake. They also offered to just credit my card upon receiving the mistakenly sent shirt, rather than send me a new one. I told the agent I just wanted the one I had ordered to begin with. Long story short, H&M refused to correct their mistake. They acted as if this were a mistake I had made upon placing my order. I even sent a follow up email explaining my frustration. H&M still will not correct a mistake made by them. I have never been so disappointed in a company or a company's customer service relations. Way to look out for your customers H&M. Needless to say I would not recommend shopping at H&M.",1,1
H&M,I bought three hooks from the home ‚Ä¶,"I bought three hooks from the home department and one of them was sent with the hanging part missing. I never sent it back as it wasn't worth the trouble and i bought another one. Once i tried to hang them in the bathroom (i put holes in my tiles) they ALL broke, meaning that the hanging part fell off as it was of a very poor quality, even though it was solid metal. POOR QUALITY and thus overpriced....",0,1
H&M,"Buy in store, do NOT get online house delivery","I love the H&M products and am a happy customer when in store, but my experiences with ordering on line have been less than satisfying due to the courier service they use, Hermes. If you do consider ordering, get it delivered to a pick-up spot or to your work please. The option to get 'free delivery to your door' means there's a big chance the courier in question will: 1) not bother ringing the doorbell when you are at home2) not leave any contact details so arranging redelivery is not an option3) leave your delivery in a not-so-safe place (in my case, on my porch in plain sight) where it can easily get stolen4) put your delivery INSIDE your rubbish bin (experience of friends) While H&M might not be personally responsible, they have chosen to keep using this company despite frequent customer complaints. They also do not inform customers which courier they use, anywhere on site or in the order journey - this is only shared once payment as been taken and delivery processed. The safest option is not to order from H&M at ALL since you risk losing your money when your package is damaged or worse, stolen. To make matters worse, customer service regarding complaints is also quite poorly.",0,1
H&M,VANITY SIZING,"I wish their sizing chart on the website was accurate. I ordered two pairs of shorts and used the sizing guide to determine what size I needed. They were way WAY too small when I got them. Since you have to pay shipping back on returns (though they don't tell you how much -- just that it will be deducted from your return), I chose to use time and gas to drive to the mall to return them. Waste of time. I won't be shopping on H&M's website in the future.",0,3

H&M,H&M @ The Fort in Birmingham worst manager called HALIMA,Visited H&M at the Fort Shopping Park in BIrmingham today. Picked a dress I liked off a rack with other dresses which were exactly the same and were marked down. Took it to the till and the assistant said it was full price. I told her it was on a rack with other dresses exactly the same and they were marked down. Took one off the rack and took it to the till to show assistant who said she couldn't honour it as the size I wanted was not on sale!!!! MY SIZE WASN'T BUT ALL THE OTHERS WERE. As I was talking to the assistant the manager overheard and went over to the rack and took all the dresses off the rack and started pulling off the sale labels and said these were yesterday's promotions and they shouldn't have these labels on.I said well they are clearly marked down so I think you should honour it all other stores would. She refused in a not very nice way. Not much people skills. And rubbish manager as yesterday's sale labels were still on items at 2pm the next day!I have emailed H&M to tell them about my experience but guess what - they haven't replied.,0,1

H&M,"""appalled""","I recently purchased some goods from H&M online for the first time, using a discount voucher, which they had sent me for signing up to their newsletter. I purchased the goods, entered my card details and paid instantly or so I thought. The goods arrived with no problems, theese were ordered on the 29 th of March. On the 26th of April I receive an email stating I have not paid, I then checked my bank payment, no payment had gone out,thinking initially it was a scam email I rang customer services. I was informed that I had chosen the 20 day option to pay 20 days from goods received,not only that they had performed a credit check on me.I never purchase from catalogues,I always pay for things instantly and I would never choose to pay 20 days later,I paid instantly and put my debit card details when asked to. I am debt free and about to apply for a mortgage. I don't religiously check my outgoings, perhaps every 3-4 weeks.I spoke to customer services, explaining I paid instantly, I questioned why they did a credit check? Reply was I choose this 20 day option, I explained I would never do that, I always pay for my goods instantly, for example like amazon. The email reminder came 7 days after the payment date to remind me that I had not paid,I had not paid as I was oblivious to the fact that I hadn't paid,if I had not seen the email,5 days after that they would have charged me a late payment fee.,which would have been a mark on my credit history. I am so annoyed and upset with H&M. I am about to apply for a mortgage, my credit rating is excellent I am debt free if this has marked my credit history, I will be absolutely devastated.The customer service person told me to ring equifax to check, I rang you have to apply online. I have to question their payment methods,is this pay 20 days later in the most smallest writing? Should this really be a correct way for a company to conduct themselves in this way?I read a thread from 2011 from a lady with the same problem, apparently H&M were going to change this so it would not happen again, it's now 2017.i was informed if this had marked my credit history, H&M would remove it but I had to ring equifax and sort this out, absolutely appaling,I did not choose a credit option, I paid instantly with my card details. I asked customer services, with what certainty would H&M remove this mark on my credit history, the reply was very vague and she said she would have to speak to her supervisor as not qualified enough in this area and came back with no solid answer. I now have to do the leg work of signing up to equifax and check to see if this has marked my credit rating, then ring back H&M to ask them to remove it,there is no guarantee. Let's hope after all my hard work to ensure my credit rating which was excellent and will not effect my mortgage application. Disgusted with this company!!!!",0,1

H&M,Unsafe and expensive shipping,"H&M is one of the only online companies still charging for shipping both when receiving or returning items. For this reason alone, I never buy clothes with them anymore.Went to my personal account and noticed that they'd registered my social security number, which they have no right to register. I was shocked to see such unsafe use of personal info. Want your identity stolen? Shop at H&M! :(For my latest order I received confirmation, and then as I received info that the order had been shipped, I was told that one of the items had sold out. I wanted to cancel the entire order, but no, the order had already shipped so that now I have to have the hassle of returning (and paying shipping) the items. That's uncool - if you change my order, you make sure that I still want the remaining items.Very disappointing!",0,1
H&M,No delivery yet,I ordered last week and my package is not yet here. I have been staying home just to receive the order. This never happened with forever 21 or misguided etc. I thought h&m was better than these brands. This is my first time ordering at H&M and I will not come back again.,0,1

H&M,Quality has gone down,"The quality of the clothes have gone down, they are poorly sewn and often ugly. The sales are not the same depending on the shop, you can find a dress with a price in one store and another price in a different one. They use to keep clothes from one season to another, so you find the same skirt during a long time with the same price and no discounts as it was new. At least it is how it works here in Sweden as I have seen it.",0,2
H&M,Unacceptable Customer Service,"I placed an order through the app, on 01/15/2017. The address in my profile was my old address, so at check out, I entered the correct shipping address, and checked to make sure that everything was checked off, that needed to be. When the order was placed, the system defaulted my address back to the old one, so now I have a package, that will be going to an address that I no longer reside at. I reached out to CS to first see it was too late to be changed, which they advised yes, as everything was already sent to the warehouse. Then the rep started to review the policy I guess, about how it can be returned to sender, and then they'll refund me when they receive it back, or if it gets lost they'll start an investigation. To prevent all of that, I asked if they had a restriction with UPS, for customers to ask UPS to hold the package at a store instead (because the company I work for, they do), and the rep told me they don't have any type of restriction with UPS. I called UPS, and of course their rep said that they did have a restriction, and the shipper would have to call to take it off, in order for my order I be held at a UPS store. I called H&M again, and spoke with a different rep, who started stating the whole ""what will happen"" policy, instead of trying to actually help. Then when I asked about UPS, the rep interrupted me while I was still speaking, and said she needs to ask her manager.. then she just put me on hold. OH, WHILE I WAS STILL SPEAKING. She came back and let me know that there was nothing they could do, and that the shipping box should've been checked, during checkout. I currently work for an online clothing website myself, so I KNOW how to properly place orders, I KNOW that there could've been something done, and I also KNOW what the shipper is capable of, when dealing with UPS. I thought about calling to s/w a manager from H&m, but I don't feel like the hassle, so I thought I'd just leave this review. Hopefully my package doesn't get lost smh and hopefully no one else has a problem like this, in the future... because they'll have no resolution for you.. even though it's a website/ app problem! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",0,1
H&M,Terrible customer service!!,"Used h&m's free returns service when I had ordered some clothing and other items. H&m refunded me ¬£5.99 too little and admitted that it was due to an error in their computer system, it's been over 2 months now and I still haven't received my full refund. Absolutely shocked and upset that a large company would act like this!",0,1
H&M,Charge for delivery but use HERMES?,"Dear H and M. If you are charging fro delivery, you could at least use an actual carrier. What a disgraceful service from a so called high street store.

It told me that the order had been shipped, but then returned because of ""fail to pick up delivery"". But with every other package I have ordered, they just place the package outside the door. So I called H&M customer service, waited for 30 minutes, and then spoke to a employee for 45 minutes - the person kept putting me on hold and then suddenly I was disconnected from the line. The problem was, that because of the ordered not being delivered, I may not have time to do a re-order because I am leaving US in a week. And the items is not available in Denmark. So I agreed to get 60% of the order and then take the chance of trying to do a re-order through the customer service. But then i was disconnected, and had to call and wait in line for 45 minutes again. Then the new employee I finally spoke to wanted to help me, but could not give me more than 30%. The whole thing took me approx 3 hours because of waiting time, being put on hold and being disconnected. And then it was not even possible to be offered the same thing. I am very dissatisfied with my situation, because I really need the items and now I don't know whether I am going to receive my order in time before I have to leave. I might miss out on my chance to get the items i ordered because of this.",0,2
H&M,Good changes happening with deliveries,"Very reluctantly, I had to place an online order as the store was out of stock in my size. I had previous bad experiences with long delivery wait times and orders that would vanish online and reappear the next day; so I was expecting the item to go astray. The item was ordered on Sat 3rd Dec and it was delivered on Mon 5th Dec. I have no idea how they got it to me so fast. If this is a sign of things to come, I'm definitely going to start shopping online again. What would be better is if H&M stores could order items for you in store,",0,5

It's ridiculous.I've bought from H&M for years, 10 dresses, 8/10 tops, trousers etc. I tried on skinny jeans the last two weekends gone. Your sizing for skinny jeans is a now joke.

H&M,Great service,"Honestly, I've never had a problem with H&M, and I think they are a great company. I already ordered many things from their online shop (I live in a small city and their local shop have fewer things than online) and everything was of good quality. However, the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is also true when it comes to shopping from H&M online. I mean, you get the quality reflected by the price; though, I think the quality-price ratio is a fair one. I had to return a few clothes either because they dind't look good on me or the size wasn't quite right. Besides encountering no problems whatsoever returning the goods, the shipping fees are much lower for returns than those of most competitors. Also, the customer service representatives have always been helpful and nice to me. Overall, great service and experience...",0,5
H&M,Not Spectacular,I like H&M but online its a different story. Sometimes they do have great promotions and they added the share button and measurements which they didn't have when they first started out. But they don't really do restocks and some of their items are over-the-top expensive. I haven't had a problem when any of my orders but I haven't ordered online in awhile because the variety isn't there and I seek more sophisticated pieces now that I'm a little older which are the most affordable. The sales are good though and you are bound to find an essential you need in your closet.,0,3

Also calls cost about 45p per minute...just to add to the pain!Dire dire dire!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!",0,1

H&M,Their delivery service is poor,"I ordered items 7 days ago for express delivery and Hermes has not been able to deliver the parcel yet due to a change in delivery address. It took them a whole week to attempt a delivery to a collection point which was then rejected for unknown reasons. Their communication with Hermes is extremely poor and I have made 8 phone calls so far. It's very unlikely I will see my parcel and all the items are sold out now. Whilst H&M customer service agents are all polite and helpful, H&M UK should consider using a different delivery company if they want to provide good customer service and online shopping experience like other high street shops do. Other than that, I like the clothes and the quality is half decent considering low prices so it's a shame I have yet again been deterred - just when I rediscovered my fondness of H&M. This experience have put me off ordering online from H&M and will shop from high street shops that provide good delivery service from now on.",0,1
H&M,Poor customer service,"I placed an order on Tuesday AM (confirmed 2/3 day delivery) for some items I require for the weekend and I have just received an email 2 days later to say they have cancelled my order, no explanation or apology.

H&M,Bad ATTITUDE towards customer,"This is a complain for one of your worker in H&M. She is a Malay. React very rudely. She is wearing blue colour shirt tying her hair on Thursday night March 24th 2016. I just went in the fitting room for my clothes. And 2 accesary. 1 necklace and earring for wearing. See which shirt suit the accessories. She told me that accessories is not allow. So I wear each shirt out to test on the accesories. And I took the earing with me for more convenient. She knock my door while I'm changing half way. And I'm opening the door while half way changing. She took the accesories away. So I'm pleasing her can I. She say no. Okay. I did not angry on her. The time goes around 10pm and the shop announce that we are closing. I'm trying to change back my clothes. She talking in Malay and said. This customer don't know how to listen to human words. Still inside. Talking to the colleague. Tu! Still inside. She inside like how long already. In my mind. It's around 10mins I'm inside from the moment I step in the changing room. She talk to her colleague on me rudely. And she knock my door. The counter not even close. And I am around 1-2mins away from the speaker announcement while she knock my door and ASK ME TO BE FASTER. Is a bad attitude. I say okay. I'm changing. I'm packing my things. And she talk bad about me. This is very very bad. What a wonderful day and she hurt me so much. That's atnight. And make my day so down. I still smile with her and told her thank you. While I lost my hair rubber band and go back to find on the room floor. I took the clothes and arrange the hanger nicely for her first. Then I went back to find my rubber band. And she say to me. Mis this way please rudely. And I told her. Wait awhile. I take my rubber band. And I say thank you to her while I lost my hair rubber band for the rushing. At first when I'm in side the room she scold me. Then I did not know it was talking about me. When Im out of the changing room door only I know. This is very bad. I know H&M has it own cool Ô∏èstyle. But because of this incident happen. It has made me toward a very bad review. And I don't think I ever wanted to enter there anymore. As at the end. I did not because of anger did not buy the stuff. I still pay for my stuffs for 3 digit. But I do feel very very sad on that night. Which is tonight. I just told your casher colleague novel when I make the paymen. That The changing room female collage is very rude. The casher say sorry to me. But sometimes is not about sorry you can change a feeling. God do say the word that you speak can't return back. God say forgive your enemy or anyone that curse you. I just forgive her. But please each of customer is very important. When a customer enter your shop you should make your customer happy. But not make their day so down. Especially end of the tired day. The worker should not bring all her working anger towards customer. This is bad. Really really bad. Really hurts. So please. Not so gangsterism towards the customer. As I felt the majority of Malaysian attitude should be amend. And everything should be start from the beginning of teaching. Not like you tought the customer did not know your language and you talking bad behind them and they walk in to your shop and pay. This is a very very bad attitude. I personally very upsad. That's hurt. But no worries. Will just continue pray for this girl to be happy and talk positive words to customer from today on. The outlet is in bukit bintang jalan Ismail the biggest H&'M I guess in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",0,1
H&M,"Bad, unacceptable in store experience","In short - rudeness from all staff members including a manager as well as possibly illegal (but definitely frowned upon) price hikes. Awful experience in your Reading Oracle store today. I got charged ¬£39.99 for a pair of denim dungarees that had no price on and were placed in the sale section. The male sales assistant who originally sold them to me had difficulty locating a code and eventually ""found"" one after wondering around the shop (and tutting at customers that were in his way). This code literally labelled the clothing as ""online item"", with no detail. When I checked this price against the dungarees on the h&m site they were more expensive, being listed as ¬£29.99 online. I went back to the store to query this where the original sales assistant was really rude to me and said he didn't know how the dungarees got into a sale section but the prices were different online because ""that's just how it is"" another sales assistant said the prices varied store to store due to ""concepts"" and then a lady who I believe to be the manager came over to state that yes the prices are ""different online because online is different"" before just walking away. I wasn't rude and I again queried how they ended up in store without a price tag anyway and it turns out these dungarees were an online return which is why there was only one of them in store... How does that justify a 33% mark up? Is that even legal? I returned the item and won't be shopping with h&m again, mostly because I am disgusted by how I was treated by 3 separate members of staff.",0,1
H&M,Choose more reliable courier!,How unfortunate that you choose Hermes to deliver orders in UK. When I rang your customer services on Thursday to inform you that my daughter's birthday was on Saturday and that Hermes did not even bother attending my address I was told you have to trust your courier. Well here you go. They didn't deliver the parcel and tracking said I refused the parcel! Waste of time. I am never ordering again unless you change courier to a reliable one or give people a choice of courier. Your customer service should have sent out the order using a next day delivery when I made the complaint and perhaps that way my daughter could have still had her Birthday gifts.,0,1
H&M,good enough.......,"ordered many times......almost every time i had to return a product because the measurements are not always exact......but it was never a problem with replacing it at the store.you can not find all the time the same product at the store, but as long as i get something back is fine. It's too expensive to resend it by email and pay the cost tu return and for the new item.the delivery is fast, the service is good and people are nice :)but all the above are just small problems.......and i will return shopping again.... :)",0,4
H&M,Value for money!,"Here you really get value for money. I am extremely satisfied.Great design, fair prices, good service and quality way above many more expensive brands. I particularly find their mens' clothing cool!",0,5
H&M,Litterly s#|+,H&M online shopping is UTTERLY s#|+.I ordered a jacket from their online shop. It has arrived at the postal office but I can't pick it up till tomorrow. Making it a week since I ordered the jacket and me getting it. All because H&M doesn't offer direct payment on their website... If I'm ever buying from H&M again it's going to be if I REALLY need something and directly from the store. NOT the website.,0,1
H&M,Slow,The handling and shipping is very slow and can take 2-3 weeks but the products are okay.,0,3

H&M,Return policy is stuck in middle ages!,I have purchased a pair of boots from hm and upon discovering they had huge dent in a heel and few scratches I decided to return. I was told that I should arrange return with customer service and spent hours waiting on the line (few times I was hanged up on). Finally managed to organize collection with local.hermes courier. Unfortunately collection slot is between 8am and 8pm so essentially was stuck at home waiting. Courier never turned up and the matter was never followed up by hm. After another day of frustrating phone calls (yet again as ting money and time) I managed to get royal mail return postage label sent to me and immediately posted boots back.Parcel was return to them 11 days ago however hm still demands their money for the item sending threatening emails.After emailing them with tracking number and screenprint stating it's been delivered to them almost 2 weeks ago I heard back that their email system is down and I should try and call. Unfortunately the avarage waiting time is over 30min and their customer service phone is not free. Why does the customer have to pay for hm's shambolic customer service stuck in middle ages?????? Absolutely appalled.,0,1
H&M,Never again,Never ever again. Had only problems with them. Even my lawyer had never seen such a rip-off before.,0,1
H&M,Terrible,Abysmal delivery service. Competitors like Zara offers next day and pick up in store delivery so why can't H&M? I don't recommended purchasing H&M items online as you're better off going to the store.,0,2
H&M,I'm really satisfied!,"I was kind of surprised when I read the reviews and got nervous since I've already placed my orders. I ordered on Nov 4th and I just got my package, which is Nov 6th. Everything is there and they seem pretty good! I'm satisfied :) O the only thing I didn't like was that the tracking number was invalid and I never got to track my packages.",0,5
H&M,Customer Service is AMAZING!,"H&M online is fantastic - loads of deals and their customer service is EXCELLENT. Often you see things in store and they only have a limited size range - not so only, loads more options! Customer service team is brilliant - friendly, always accommodating and you don't have to wait endless hours to speak to anyone - FANTASTIC!!! Also, Customer Service can sometimes find things you can't see online anymore - always worth a try. The only thing you have to bear in mind is that delivery can take a while (not always) - so long as you know that, it's no big deal. The returns service is brilliant, the prices are brilliant, they are always unbelievably helpful - wouldn't hesitate to recommend!",0,5
H&M,Not a fan,"A few weeks ago, I ordered some clothes with h&m. Their website is okay, not that hard to use. I got an e-mail that my package was being dispatched and that was it... I was waiting and waiting for the delivery, that had already exceeded the 'delivery date'. The track and trace, a very useful tool, did not work. I ended up calling the customer service (no complaints about that, the woman on the phone was extremely friendly) and apparently my package had arrived in the post office a few days ago... I don't mind paying for a delivery, but not when it is like this! It's not that hard to keep your customers up to date via e-mail!",0,2
H&M,Rubbish website,Sort out your online experience.. poor checkout process and no way to change delivery address,0,2
H&M,Terrible,"Did 2 separate orders online going to different addresses and received confirmation for both waited over a week for the delivery and had no email saying it had been dispatched. I therefore called them to find out the situation, the person i spoke to was no help at all and couldn't tell me where my order was, i therefore called back and spoke to someone else who informed me that they had bundled my two orders together and were going to charge one of the cards the full amount and send it to one address.... rather than the 2 cards and 2 addresses. The lady also informed me that they have processed it as they claimed an email was sent to me saying there was an issue with this order. However having checked my junk email and scrolled through my inbox it became apparent that this was not the case. I am extremely dissatisfied with this service, I can safely say I will never be shopping at H and M again.",0,1
H&M,Slow delivery,"Ordered 2 dresses online on the 2nd September 2015. They had been dispatched on the 3rd as I received an email.. Today is the 11th and still no sign of my items. Anyway hopefully they will turn up soon. Maybe I'm just being impatient but the thing is, I have ordered them for my holiday. If they don't fit I will have to return them but am worried as the summer sale is nearly over and at this rate, there won't be any summer clothes left. üòï",0,2
H&M,4 stars,"I have complains about their delivery service, but everything was resolved so is not a big deal. The clothes are good quality, but bigger size, so you need to take one size smaller than normal.",0,4

H&M,H&M - Presentation,"Went into an H&M store in North Wales, I bought a t-shirt and the female Store Manager rubbishly folded it and wacked it into the 5p bag. I said to her to they learn you how to fold and she said if I folded for every customer then I would be here all day.Oh well, customer service sucks where I live and its trend and the managers don't do anything",0,3
H&M,Always Perfect Service,"I have purchased from H&M for several years now, and I have not yet experienced anything negative. Once I received the wrong item. I contacted Customer Support and they talked me through the return process and after I sent the item back, I received the right item after a few days.Always a great experience and shout-out to the great support team :-)(For further information, I'm from Denmark, so I've ordered from the Danish site)",0,5
H&M,No complaints,Fast delivery and items as described on website. Although would be nice to be able to return goods in actual stores.,0,5
H&M,Horrible company... prefer to ruin credit scores than resolve issues,"Made a purchase a while ago from their online outlet, and set up an account. Believing that whilst they had my direct debit details, they'd automatically take money from my account, added a disproportionate charge on the account, and stained my credit score. Called to say this was a misunderstanding, fell on deaf ear reluctant to offer any assistance other than paying off the full account.Won't ever shop with them again.",0,1
H&M,Good and reliable online store but boring shopping experience,This is a review of the online store and not a physical H&M.This was my first order of several sale items and it went by without any problems. Delivery was fast and all the items were in perfect condition. One thing I want to mention as an idea is for H&M to make the online shopping experience more interesting in terms of layout and seasonal deals. I often see the weekend free shipping code but that's hardly 'interesting'. Compared with Feelunique and Lookfantastic's website H&M's is really lacking.,0,5
H&M,It's just ok...,Average to slow shipping times every time I ordered there but they got my order wrong twice by sending the wrong colours. Kind of frustrating but all other times were fine.,0,3
H&M,Never again. Was lied to in store. Feel like a fool,"So I went to the Guildford store to buy a top and to return a few things I had purchased online. I was told that none of the H&M stores were allowed to use their card terminals. So everything today had to be cash. I had to pay cash for my top and could not get a refund because I had made my online purchase with card. I asked why, and they told me that it was because it was very expensive for H&M to process card payments today. The store was simply not allowed to do this all day. I was then sent away. I contacted H&M customer services via twitter and was told that the store should have processed my refund and that I would get a phone call from customer services today. I have not received any calls from them and I feel like a big fool. Cannot believe that the store treated me this way. They are probably having a good laugh on my account in the store. I have just started using H&M recently and after this I will stop. I am very upset and have ended up using way too much on something that should have been dealt with in store within minutes. I would not even give them one star, but there is not an option for this.",0,1
H&M,Good if you have a low budget,"If you have a low budget and you're not too picky, this store is pretty good.",0,4
H&M,When you shop at M&S  pay attention if the check out assistant puts ALL  your items in the bag,I went to M&S in Cambridge and the check out attendant did not include one of the items that I purchased in the shop. This is not the first time it happens to me and I am starting to wonder if there is something fishy going on.I would like to know if it had happen to some of you. You go to the shop pay for all the items and when you get home a small item is missing from your bag. Usually is something in the order of ¬£1-4. Last time I purchased among other things a small white belt for ¬£3.00 which was NOT conveniently placed in the bag. Then it is easy for them to accuse us of losing it or trying to cheat them since we cannot prove we did not bring it home. Proving a negative is a logical fallacy.,0,2
H&M,Extremely rude customer service!!!!,"I love the store!!! It's great, has nice clothes and accessories as well as affordable prices. But the customer service has got to improve!!!! Nobody greets you, when you get to the check out, they act as if you're bothering them. This has happened every single time my daughter and I shop at the location in Atlantic Station in Atlanta, GA. Makes me want to order online only!!!!!!!",0,1
H&M,"Awkward, Waste of Time.","From hours being wasted with the following message during checkout:""This product ran out of stock while you were shopping or you have already bought the maximum amount in the current or pending order.""To the inability to organize searches to prices or search for specific items which took interest before, I think the browsing experience, and the inconvenience affecting it, is highly flawed. Although I had ¬£300 in my basket, with ¬£100 worth removed due to the mentioned issue, I was soon to drop all of it, leaving their service in irritation.",0,3
H&M,Delayed Delayed Delayed,Terrible service - order still not coming. Got in store.,0,1
H&M,Terrible service,"Firstly, h&m don't deliver to business addresses which in today's day and age seems unfathomable.Secondly, despatch times are very poor. From placing an order on Saturday march 1st it went into packing on Monday March the 3rd yet the order was not delivered until Monday 10th! Lastly, I decided to return a pair of bikini bottoms for exchange for the next size up. Feeling apprehensive about the time it might take to receive the matching bottoms to my top I sent my return via Royal Mail the very next day. It's now the 18th and I go on holiday in 5 days. There was no update on my account and so I decided to email customer services today to check the status. I received a response in a reasonable amount of time which is the only positive thing I have to say. However, the customer service representative remarked after quoting the maximum lead times that it is very unlikely that you will receive your exchange this week. Most unhelpful and unreliable. Will stick to shopping in store rather than online in future.",0,2
H&M,love the shop,busy life and i end up always online. love the shop. good quality and prices but the delivery is within a week (average). please hm introduce next day delivery! for all the rest 5 stars.,0,4
H&M,Absolute Nightmare!!!,"I've been waiting ages for my stuff which I ordered almost 2 weeks ago. But that's not even the worst part - when you order online, it's on a default option to just invoice you, and set you up with ¬£200 credit.Now I don't want any credit, and all I want to do is pay for my items with my card, like I do with every other online retailer, but no such luck. I've rang up and asked them (whilst I was inquiring as to where my order actually is) if I could just pay with my card over the phone........The answer is no!! What I have to do, is go to my bank and make the payment through them, which is completely insane, and way to much hassle.In short, I really regret ever using the online store, as it's as the title of this review clearly states, A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!!H&M have a lot of work to do regarding their online presence, and I will certainly never be using them again!",0,1
H&M,Not great :/,"Took a while for my parcel to arrive, however it was over the Christmas break. I ordered 2 pairs of size 10 trousers when they arrived they were more like a size 6! No way in hell would anyone above a 6 fit into these which was very disappointing. Had to take them back and decided to do so via store, its a shame they only offer you a credit note!I would have thought that being in ladies fashion they would have learnt by now that most women would never buy 2 sizes bigger than their actual clothes size!",0,3
H&M,girls dream type of shop,"HM is an every girls dream type of shop. The shoe quality is awesome, customer service and shipping is great too. Definitely cant beat there prices, I find myself on that site every day its soooo addictive!",0,4
H&M,Don't order online,"Twice now, my order has been delayed and cancelled due to a lack of options on the payment page when ordering online. It does not give you the option of having different billing and shipping addresses, so BEWARE that when you want to order something when at uni, or working away from home they will delay your order and to release it you have to call an 08 number. Ridiculous. Never had this problem with any other company.",0,1

H&M,Won't order again,"Items take AGES to arrive. Most of the time they are not in stock so arrive in seperate packages, weeks apart. I e-mailed customer service and got no response so I called them.

Just not worth the long wait.",0,2
H&M,¬£12 pair of shoes landed me in ¬£500 debt. DO NOT BUY FROM H&M!!!,"Back in June i ordered quite alot of items from the website for my mum because she cant work the internet! Everything seemed ok,everything arrived (over 3 weeks later might i add) and we realized that a pair of shoes were missing. We just assumed that they were out of stock and we ended up buying a pair elsewhere. About 3 weeks later i received a letter from H&M stating that i owed them money including charges for not paying for the pair of shoes. I phoned up H&M about this and they explained that they had put the shoes on a credit account for me. Em.. you opened a credit account without my permission and didn't tell me about it? i asked. Yes i know its a bit misleading said the call centre agent, ""it's something were working on"". I agreed to pay for the shoes and stupidly paid for the charges. I thought this would be the end of my experience with H&M. I was wrong.From then on i have received debt letters and I'am now receiving letters demanding ¬£500 in court fees, all for a ¬£12 pair of shoes (which i have paid for) .I have contacted H&M on a number of occasions and i have been promised they would contact the debt collectors to inform them that i have paid for the shoes. This has not happened. I have contacted the debt collectors myself and have sent in proof of my payment. Hopefully this will resolve it.H&M are completely out of order and the service has honestly been the worse i have ever received. This is the thanks you get for shopping with them! With all this going on it has affected my exams and constantly sending emails and making phone calls has took up so much of my time.Its disgusting and i would advise you not to shop with H&M.",0,1
H&M,It's ok (Netherlands),"I used to order a lot at the H&M shop online, but lately I don't like their collection so I don't order. After changing the online webshop it looks messy and is not customer friendly. What I completely dislike about H&M shop online is that it takes ages before you got your order. Sometimes it takes over a month, because H&M keeps changing the delivery date.",0,3
H&M,"Absolutly piss poor! Avoid, stick to their retail stores!","Very piss poor service, I order an item, they do NOT let you specify a different delivery address, and there is nothing on their site to tell you that either. So I placed my order using my work address ... and nothing...2 Weeks later they sent me a letter (thats right snail mail, not an email or a call but a letter!) that was sent from Switerland/Sweden so not even from the UK from ANOTHER COUNTRY telling me I have 5 days to contact them to respond to the delivery issue the only problem here (aprat from the fact the sent me a letter and not an email) was the fact that the letter had arrived 8 days later so i called them... Only to be told that they cannot send to commercial property and do not allow name changes... Sending letters is their policy or something instead of emailing.. Suffice to say I told them to cancel the order completely! Orders are shipped from Sweden/Switerland so do NOT expect fast delivery times. AVOID just stick to their retail stores!",0,1
H&M,Quality and deliverytimes,"The quality is poor, on the pictures it looks amazing, but when you receive your order some things are really ugly and not a good quality.The delivery times are something to be shamed about.

H&M,Worse online shopping experience ever,"I had been looking forward to using H&M UK's site for some time, so placed my 1st order for ¬£250. After waiting 2 weeks I contacted them to see where it was, to be informed it had been cancelled due to a 'security issue' (turns out they had my maiden name/previous address registered for their newsletter, so duplicate accounts with the same email address - yet the website had registered me again!) and they had send me a letter (never received). I have to say that UK H&M 'customer services' is by far the rudest and worst I have ever dealt with, the 1st woman I spoke to accused me of being a fraudster and shouted at me! I called back to complain and was offered 15% off! Will never, ever use H&M again - such a pity, I have been a loyal Next (amongst others) customer for 16 years and have never experienced any problems with them. Very poor!",0,1
