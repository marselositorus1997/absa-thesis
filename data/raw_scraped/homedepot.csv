The Home Depot,I purchased a washer and dryer from…,"I purchased a washer and dryer from Home Depot and waited more than a week for delivery. On day of delivery (5/8/21), the installer (a non-English speaker) just said, ""We'll be around in one half hour."" That's it. The caller ID just gave a telephone number not the Home Depot. The same thing when when he arrived at my house. No ID, no instructions, no introductions. When he came to the house, he just examined the route with a tape measure and pointed out the spots where it was too narrow and where we had to widen it. He said that he couldn't do it and that I should call back when it's fixed. He left without installing the washer or dryer.",0,1
The Home Depot,I wish I could give a zero,"I wish I could give a zero. I ordered a stove over the phone from a person and used the 10% off coupon they sent me. Even had her repeat the new balance. Got the bill and the discount wasn't there but instead it was placed under the 24 months interest free. That is not what I wanted so I thought one quick call would correct it. OMG!!! Eight phone calls, cut off 5, once transferred in the middle of trying to explain, twice sent to another phone loop that kept telling me the correct information I was giving them didn't work. I finally called the local store in Sunset Valley Texas and spoke to Ricardo. Basically he said pay your bill and the money will catch up. Tried to explain that is had been put in the wrong catagory but he was no help. In fact, no one could help me. I have never had such bad customer service from a store in my entire life. It wasn't the $90 bucks I was saving but the principle of doing the right thing and treating people right, I am going to pay the bill in full, chop up my card and send it back to them. I know one little person doing this is no big deal to them but I will take my business elsewhere.",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot is a joke,"Home Depot is a joke. We just bought 5 appliances from them. They delivered them 2 days ago. We tried the washer/dryer tonight and it put water in but won't drain. I called to get someone out here and the first girl (after 20 min on the phone with her) told us they couldn't help us till 4 days later. So, we have a ton of sopping wet clothes in the washer. Called the Manager of the store and he told me we should either leave clothes in there sopping wet or take each piece out... wring them out .. and hang it on a clothes line out back. We live in a condo. Home Depot has the worst customer service of anyone I've ever seen. And, this is only half of the story. I'll spare you on the other details. We are going to return all 5 appliances we got from them and go to Lowes.",0,1
The Home Depot,This is absolutely the worst store ever…,This is absolutely the worst store ever to have anything delivered from. They tell you on the website and when you are placing the order that you will have it in one or two days and you actually get it in 2 to 3 weeks if ever. It is the worst experience I have ever had multiple times I have given them a chance and every single time it is the same thing over and over.I know everyone is using the excuse that it's covid covid covid but why is it that other companies can get their deliveries done on time and it is only this stupid store that cannot get it done right.,0,1
The Home Depot,Awful major appliance experience with Home Depot,"I purchased a major appliance on the Home Depot website that was assigned to the San Carlos store for fulfillment. After two failed deliveries that involved very poor communications with me, I cancelled the order via online support and was promised a refund in 5-7 business days. That hasn't happened despite multiple contacts taking significant time with both the online chat and support phone numbers. I've now had to resort to disputing the charge with the credit card company. Perhaps it can do better than I could to motivate Home Depot to issue the refund or, if not, post a chargeback to its merchant account.What I've learned is that Home Depot's customer support, at least for major appliance purchases, is uncoordinated between its own departments and Home Depot contractors (in this case, Temco Logistics), and is implemented in a way that discourages support requests by customers. If one needs to deal with delivery issues or cancel before delivery, be prepared to be very frustrated. For major appliance purchases, I recommend that consumers not consider Home Depot, despite their good selection and competitive prices, because of the potential headaches if something goes wrong in fulfilling the order.",0,1

The Home Depot,"Negligent , incompetent and not worth your money or time.","We ordered 1600 dollars worth of appliances from the Home Depot in Riverdale Utah, and it has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had with a company. The subcontractor that they use lied and said my husband had requested a reschedule, and it never happened. We waited all day for it to be delivered and when he called to check on it they told him he had requested a reschedule. To his face!!! We were never contacted by either HD or the delivery folks about a reschedule , they just got lazy and did not want to deal with it. We were never contacted!! Then it turns out the dryer was damaged and they had to switch it out, could bring washer but not dryer. Not good enough I need both at he same time, what if they bring washer and dryer does not show up for another three weeks, or the delivery folks decide they just don't want to do it that day. They rescheduled for the 7th of May, at 3 pm and again they cant do it, some other lame excuse. Offered to upgrade the appliances but really at this point I do not trust the entire process, I feel very badly for the young lady that helped us with the sale at customer service, I hope she does not work on commission, because we cancelled the order , and we best get our money back. If they cant see the sale through to completion of delivery then there is no point. Why offer free delivery if you cant stand by the carrier with confidence , who are they hiring to do it? Do they even know? and to lie to us like we are stupid is insulting beyond belief.",0,2

The Home Depot,DELIVERY NIGHTMARE,"Think twice before buying an LG product ( and maybe a lot of other things) that needs to be delivered.Home Depot does NOT do the deliver. LG handles the delivery and they use whoever they can get cheapest. Driver messed up...called us saying the wrong thing was on the truck. After several calls to Home Depot and pics from driver, it turns out it WAS the CORRECT item. All he had to do was double check the model number!Now we are waiting for delivery info. Driver says he is no longer in our area. Home Depot rep said they waited on hold for over 30 minutes with LG. Supposedly Home Depot asked LG to prioritize it and have driver delivery it after all his other deliveries today. Home Depot rep said they'd would not be surprised if they just ignored that and shocked if we actually get it today. Update them if we do not get it, call tomorrow and they'll look into it further. That's the extent of their assistance and we get stuck sitting around all day wondering if it will come.",0,1
The Home Depot,Yep 1 star for the home services,"Yep 1 star for the home services. The hire sub contractors not Home Depot employees. Had kitchen upgrade that the countertop installation damages my wall real bad, home depot excludes responsibility on any damages, you have no contact with the contractors. When you pay over $10k you don’t expect to go out and pay someone to clean up their mess. DO NOT USE HOME DEPOT for home project they take no responsibility, now they want to bug you about paying them. I will never use them again. I’m going to LOWES from now on.",0,1
The Home Depot,I would post a no start review if it…,"I would post a no start review if it were possible. I have no problem with the items I purchased (or tried to purchase) so I guess 1 star is acceptable. I made a purchase online and in the Florence SC store location. The item I ordered online did not arrive on the date that I was given when I ordered so I had to have someone else pick it up for me as I had to work on that day (having previously taken the day off to pick up item on original delivery date) I contacted customer service and asked how to change the pick up person on my order and was told that I could not change the pick up person and I would have to pick the item up myself and I would have to do so within a 7 day time frame of the arrival at my local store. i explained that I could not pick up the item and that it was thru no fault of my own but because the item was delivered on the specified date. i was told sorry but you have to pick it up or get a refund, no exceptions. To say the least I was very upset about this as I had made a large purchase from the store to have my bathroom remolded. I tried to change my schedule but could not. In desperation I phone the local store and after a bit was able to talk to someone sympathetic to my problem and they arranged for my contractor to pick up my items within the specified 7 day period. I later went to the store and picked out several large items (a vanity and toilet and other bathroom items). In total I spent almost $2500.00. When my contractor went to pick up my items he was told that the vanity I purchased was not in stock! How was it not in stock? I went to the store and a clerk checked that they had each item in stock before I purchased. I paid for the items (I did not order them) Yet at pick up they don't have the item. I even bought one that I really didn't want because it was in stock. Yet by magic they don't have it. So I have a bathroom torn out and no sink and vanity to put back. Oh but Home Depot gave me a refund for it so what more do I want? (What a person claiming to be the manager actually said to my sister!) Nice products, crap service. Maybe Lowe's isn't so bad after all!",0,1
The Home Depot,Ordered a table and 6 chairs,Ordered a table and 6 chairs. Delivered today by complete incompetents.. On the way in they knocked out the power to our entire condominium unit. They ran their truck into the power lines and the delivery company that works for HD blamed the power lines for being to low though hundreds of trucks have come down this street without knocking out our power lines.

The Home Depot,Home Depot Couldn't Care Less,I recently placed my first online order with Home Depot and it did not go well. Just like most people these days I have packages delivered to the house from time to time to avoid the crowds of the stores. I have never had an issue in the 13 years living here. Today my Home Depot order supposedly was delivered but there were no packages waiting when I got home. The part that really makes me angry is Home Depot's response when I brought this to their attention. All they did was confirm that Fedex was claiming a delivery occurred and then informed me that they would be keeping my money and instructed me to contact my financial institution. They couldn't care less. I just got soaked for around $350 in tools but the thousand or so dollars a month I used to spend in their stores in now going to be brought elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and bring your online shopping somewhere else.,0,1
The Home Depot,Terrible!!! Don't waste your money!,"I spent thousands of dollars on a online order and most of the items had an option to be delivered to my home which arrived 99% fine.But for the ones I had to pick up at the store because no free delivery was available (again I spent thousands of dollars, not sure why I couldn't get a wheelbarrow delivered when I got a rotatailer sent to my home, but anyway!) We chose the curbside pick up option and went to the store once we were notified that the order was ready for pick up. After driving all the way there, we were told nothing was ready for pick up, then told by another rep to go through the store and just get the items from different aisles and just take it home...later, another rep said our items were actually in a specific aisle waiting for us...we went to find out only some of our items were there. Spoke with a few more reps, no one knew where the other items where and at the end just walked away and said ""sorry, we can't help you.""Called corporate and the store manager multiple times to get a resolution. The store manager never called me back as he said he would so I had to call back after 2 days and repeat myself to him because he had forgotten all about it. He then tried to blame his associates for not following up with me. Complete joke. Still no items and but I have been charged for them of course.Don't shop at Home Depot. You have been warned!",0,1

Mistakes happen I understand that but when we called to have the issue addressed they could do nothing but refund my money( in ten days). We asked if we could pick up that model at a local store and was told no.

The Home Depot,Worst customer service and Asurion insurance service ever!,Worst customer service ever! I bought a Samsung washer and dryer back in 2016 about five months later my washer started giving me problems. It was shaking a lot and because it is upstairs you can hear it all over the house. Called Home Depot and was told to call my protection plan which is Asurion. My advice do not buy that insurance they are awful. It is now 2021 and I’m still dealing with them they come to my house they replace parts and then they say it works but the problem is still the same and now it has a squeaky sound. I’ve had about a minimum of 12 visits each with different tech and different diagnostics. This is extremely stressing I even got sick from it and had to go to the doctor of how stressful this is. The last person that came was supposed to install something else and he had no idea what it was when he came but then said he didn’t need it and that the previous tech what’s wrong. At that point I literally wanted to cry in front of that tech buy I held it together. This morning I called Home Depot again and guess what they’re going to send another tech for the 100th time. The only thing they do is apologize but that it’s part of the policy. And by the way for something to be replaced they have to replace that same part three times which makes zero sense. I’ve taken videos of the problem and offered to email them the videos but they refuse they say it’s not necessary. I’ve talk to managers and supervisors and they are not helpful they keep saying they need to send a tech. Please don’t buy Samsung washer and dryer from Home Depot and especially do not buy their insurance.,0,1

I paid for them with the company homedepot credit card and had them delivered to the company i work for. we were all waiting for them to come in. when the order showed up, the fedEx guy only asked for a name and he went on his way. we recived a larger homedepot box and a Milwaukee box with a shipping lable on it. I opened the homedepot box and discovered the 1/2 inch impact gun with 2 batteries a charger and a case wasn't there. I checked the weight on the shipping lables and it all add up to what was in the boxes. I thought they would find the missing tool wasnt put into the box. I contacted customer service and they said they would look in to it and it would take a couple of days. I had to contact them several times after a week. it turn out the item we didnt get was shipped in a separate box that they said was delivered at the same time as the other boxes. I dont know what happened to the tool we didnt get, but we dont have it and now we are out 450 dollars. the point of the review is this could happen to anyone. dont tell the delivery person your name or sign anything until you confirm all of your order is there. the delivery person wont be happy waiting for you to open a homedepot box to make sure everything you ordered is there. its probably not a good idea to ship a 450 dollar tool in the Milwaukee box with a shipping lable on it so any one walking be the delivery truck can see it and take it.",0,1

Measured incorrectly causing 2 month delay on one of the windows.3. Told me they DON'T USE SUBCONTRACTORS-they do and do not speak English so not able to communicate with the crew.4.

The Home Depot,Worst Service EVER!!,"To begin, if I could give a lower rating, I would. I ordered two exterior doors for a project in January. The sign in the store said “Delivered to store in 14 days”, but I was told it would probably be more like 4-6 weeks because of covid ( the excise for all poor service lately). After waiting over 3 MONTHS and checking repeatedly for status and always being told “it says it will be here tomorrow”, or “I checked and it is supposed to be on the truck this week”... I decided to cancel the order and buy from another company. I went to the store, cancelled the order and was told they couldn’t refund the money at that time since they didn’t have enough cash, they would mail a check. I asked when I should expect it and was told “sometime next week”. I waited 9 days and called. I was then told “it could take up to 21 days”. So that means waiting another month (21 business days / month) to POSSIBLY get my money back that they have had since January (it is MAY). During this wait, I ordered a vanity top without a projected delivery date. I received an email saying “your vanity top has shipped” then a second one two days later saying “your vanity top will be delivered tomorrow”. I got a phone call from the delivery service saying “we will drop it off on Wednesday and there is no signature required, we will drop it off”. When it didn’t arrive by Friday, I called and was told the shipment was refused by customer and sent back. I explained the item was never brought to me and I never refused it, the service desk lady said she would try to get it back. I was called a week later and told “we can’t get it back and it is now out of stock”. This is the poorest service I have ever seen. How does this store stay in business!!?? It shouldn’t. I will never do business with them again. UNBELIEVABLE!!!",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot and United Turbine,"About 6 weeks ago I had 2 closets needing replacement from wood sliders to mirrored sliders so I went to Home Depot to purchase them, everything went smoothly and I had United Turbine (Home Depot vendor) install them after having purchased the doors a few weeks beforehand. All I can say is 5 stars is not enough, customer service is VERY friendly, courteous and helpful! The installer came on time, finished quickly and cleaned up after himself. A couple of days ago, they installed my new front door, couldn't be happier, I had a special code lock put in, no problem, Gabriel, the installer has seen and done it all, everything looks beautiful and works like a charm. I read some reviews about United Turbine that were pretty negative regarding their scheduling, and not showing up etc...The reviews are mostly over 7 months ago, maybe they changed their scheduling process or personnel because everything from start to finish was 5 Stars! These are good people. Trust and confidence go a long way!",0,5
The Home Depot,Writing this review after suddenly…,"Writing this review after suddenly being disconnected after 33 minutes and 44 seconds (my phone shows the amount of time on hold). I initially got through to a recording and my question required a customer service rep and thirty-plus minutes later, it goes to a busy signal. This is their online customer support number of 1-800-430-3376.I called this number because I couldn't get through to my local store calling numerous times over the past two days to cancel the one single item from my order that they didn't cancel. I have screenshots of the items and the large quantities it shows they have in stock but AFTER I placed my order, apparently only one item was available. I can't be bothered to go and pick that up and want to cancel and apparently can't. There is no simple way to do it although they do say they'll automatically cancel if it's not picked up in a week. I'm certainly not going to trust them on that one so I will get it.I am a huge Amazon fan and could order all the items from Amazon but want to help keep healthy competition in big business going. If this is the way Home Depot is going to handle customers, we're going to start dropping away like flies. They'll still get plenty of business but a big hunk of folks who can order from Amazon, will and I think this experience just sealed Home Depot's fate with me. Shame on Home Depot for such deplorable customer support.",0,1
The Home Depot,Don't order anything that isn't an appliance,"If you are ordering an appliance, they have great customer service. Anything else, especially from an outside ""vendor"", they don't care. They take no responsibility for it. I ordered a mattress, supposed to be delivered April 30. When I called, they gave me a case # and said someone will contact you in 24 hours. They didn't. I called back, they said the vendor didn't respond to them yet. Silence. I finally said ""what am I supposed to do now? She said, ""I could call the vendor"". Great, do that. Now it's supposed to be shipping May 14, but no idea when I'll receive it. Pretty sure I'll be calling them back May 16.",0,1

The cashier lured us and said why don’t I open another credit card account to avail $25.00 discount. I accepted and entered my details and the cashier said I had to wait for approval from the banker. I waited for sometime and was asked to go to a different person. There I waited for nearly 15 minutes as she was on the phone speaking to the banker and then I was told not approved and no reason was given to me for the rejection. I had to stand there for more than 20 minutes. I was really frustrated with the overall experience @ Home Depot, Edison. I conveyed to the manager of the store that this was not a good experience to lure the customer in to taking a card , then making them wait for long time and then inform them of being rejected without providing any reason.

The Home Depot,2 bunks of 1x4x6 S4S White Wood.  Not Good.,"I ordered 2 bunks of 1x4x6 S4S White Wood Board. The delivery date was promised as 4/14 at the contractor counter. I took the day off to inspect the delivery. About 3:30 pm, I decided to see if I could look up the delivery tracking. The delivery date had been changed to 4/27 (almost 2 weeks later). There was no notice of this change. So, I took another day off on the 27th. The wood arrived early that morning. I ordered bunks of wood because I need over 400 pcs for my project and didn't want to have to paw through the stacks of firewood that gets leftover at the store. The top bunk of lumber, even when banded, shows several pieces of warped wood. This stuff is supposed to be kiln-dried and sanded on all 4 sides. It's not. To add insult to injury, I was charged full price for this lumber - there was no bulk discount even though I bought it by the bunk. THD didn't have to worry about restacking the firewood left by other customers or do anything but deliver it to my house. Unfortunately, The Home Despot is essentially the only lumber game in town. Very disappointing. On my next project, I'll have to work the spreadsheet and see if going with a ""Big Box"" store actually saves money.",0,2

My wallet was stolen 2 weeks ago, so I have temporary driver's license, and the credit card number used was closed out with the issue of a new card. The temporary license does not have a bar code, so I was unable to receive a credit. I had several other pieces of identification, multiple recently issued credit cards, a work ID (front line health care worker). None of this was good enough. The items will all be reloaded another day and taken back, so everyone including the HD staff can waste their time too. This is a miserable way to treat someone who has had their wallet stolen and clearly has plenty of ID.This applies to the Montano store in Albuquerque.I have almost always had pleasant service in this store. I frequently use this store and make large and small purchases most weeks. I hope this type of problem does not occur again.",0,1

There was a very nice young man who helped me put the mulch and dirt on a palette. I proceeded to checkout where the cashier said he would call someone to help put the mulch and dirt in my car. After a half hour wait I finally asked a young man if he could me. He was very annoyed but he did help me. Now im a female senior and obviously needed the help. My suggestion would be to have more help on the weekends and also perhaps stress upon customer service to your young help. I was desperate and even tipped heavily in desperation for help.,0,1

The Home Depot,Comedy of errors,"I went into Home Depot to buy a Weber Grill. I told the salesperson I used natural gas rather than propane. He told me no problem,just buy a conversion kit. Before installing the conversion kit I went to the Weber website and looked up the conversion procedure. Weber stated they do not allow converting from propane to natural gas on any of their products. So why didn't the Home Depot know this and tell me before I bought it and had it delivered. So I had to return to the store since repeated efforts to reach them by phone left me hanging on waiting forever. I explained the problem to customer service and was told they would pick up the grill in 6 days, a Saturday. No one came so I called back in the afternoon and was told an attempted pickup was made AT 6:40 am ON A SATURDAY. NO CALL, NO TEXT, NO E-MAIL TO LET ME KNOW AND NO ONE BOTHERED TO RING THE DOORBELL. So next step is hopefully get it picked up in 2 days. What a comedy of errors. I will never go into a Home Depot again.",0,1

Never has been good in this area. Guess it won't change. May pay a bit more elsewhere, but I'm going there.",0,1
The Home Depot,DON'T ORDER WINDOWS FROM HOME DEPOT,"DON'T ORDER WINDOWS FROM HOME DEPOT & THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE RECEIVED IN A VERY LONG TIME. Design Salesperson is new, doesn't know anything & didn't tell these senior citizens that the plantation shutters that have been on 20 yrs, with paint and putty all around them MUST BE REMOVED!!! The furniture must be moved. Home Depot doesn't do that, nor can we. Home Depot never mentioned this when specifically asked & 2nd measurer came out and he informed us that there must be a 2' space all around the windows. I think there needs to be more training. Cancelled $4000 worth of new windows and now fighting with Home Depot to get my refund of $993.47. Can't get anyone/salesman, manager, etc., to call back or respond to an email. Incredible, very unprofessional and against Contractors License Board for requiring a 25% deposit when it should only be 10%. Lesson. Don't pay anything with a check or cash, put it on your credit card, so you can dispute.",0,1

I also paid for assemblers to come assemble the table. Once received, assemblers came and told us we were missing 2 chairs. Called Home depot... been on dropped calls or on hold for over 4 hours now. They are saying its USpack fault because all packages sent but when I call USpack, they are saying they never got the package. Instead of Home Depot taking initiative to figure it out, they are making the customer run around to figure this out. By far the worst customer service I have ever received. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.",0,1

I called and Home Depot said I should turn off the breakers to the machine because it was probably an electrical issue. Called an electrician who said, ""no, I can see the machine is not set up correctly."" So I called Home Depot back and said I wanted to return it. They basically said, ""sorry about your luck"" So I am stuck with an $800 PIECE OF GARBAGE that I haven't been able to use since it was delivered. Home Depot is trash. I am hugely disappointed.",0,1

We were told directly that the installers would appear in Home Depot shirts with HD badges and were HD employees. Instead some non-english speaking guys came without masks. When they were done, HD insisted upon final payment even before scheduling inspection. They failed to schedule the inspection until after the permit expired and then only in response to a bad review. The Installation Manager, Craig, made excuse after excuse and became rude and insulting, belittling me because of my small company before leaving.

The Home Depot,DON’T LET HOME DEPOT INSTALL YOUR…,"DON’T LET HOME DEPOT INSTALL YOUR APPLIANCES. USE A LOCAL SERVICE COMPANY. We bought 4 appliances for our kitchen..stove, dishwasher, microwave and fridge. After 2 years we started having problems:1. The dishwasher outflow tube was not secured I. It’s bracket at installation. Unbeknown to us, every time we opened the door it was rubbing against the hose. The result: water leaked under the cabinet and under the hard wood floor. Beyond paying for the service call, we had to order new flooring and pay for the installation.2. The microwave (3 years old) died. Bought a new one and had it installed by another company. Discovered during installation the exhaust fan was never set up correctly and it was exhausting into the motor. Paid for new microwave and installation charges.3. The refrigerator was installed by Home Depot. After about 3 years we discovered water in the garage. It was from the refrigerator inside the house. Paid for a service call and discovered during installation the ice maker water supply was over tightened causing it to kink. Over a period of time it was spraying the wall behind the refrigerator. We paid for the repair and then had to pay to have the saturated drywall and insulation replaced.So we had 3 of 4 appliances improperly installed. Spent a lot of time and paid for 3 service calls, new flooring, new drywall and insulation and a new microwave that should have lasted longer than it did.DON’T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU...VERY EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCE AND VERY INCONVENIENT",0,1

It was a bit windy and cool and had been raining that morning. We went to the Customer Service Center and told them what we wanted to purchase. In that area there was about 6 people standing around talking to each other. We were told they would send someone out to the Pit where the lawn mowers were at. We waited about 15 minutes and talked to 2 other people asking for help. Then another 15 minutes went by and my husband went back in to ask again. By this time my husband who is disabled and was in pain was not in a good mood. When my husband got back to the desk he was told the person was on their way out. There was no apology for how long we had been waiting just that it was busy. We would have been fine if someone would have told us up front that it would be while. My husband ended up blowing up and said he was leaving and the employee said ""adios!"". We went to Race Brothers ( dealer for Cub Cadet) and had an excellent experience and a better financing 0% for 36 months. We know where we will go next time. NEVER AGAIN at Home Depot.

I emptied all my appliances in the kitchen to prepare for the delivery. At 1:30pm I called and they said they were not able to deliver today. They explained to me that the delivery address automatically changed for some reason. Spoke to a supervisor, she advised me again there is no way I can get them delivered today because of the address error. I asked “Why didn’t someone call when the address didn’t come up”? I was told she will look into it but again can’t be delivered today. After going back and forth for 10 minutes I realized I was not getting my order today. I asked to have it cancelled and refunded so I can go buy my appliances elsewhere. She said yes that’s fine but it will take 7-10 days to get your monies back. UNBELIEVABLE!!! So I’m jammed in a corner! Can’t receive my appliances and won’t get my money back for 7-10 days. 100% unacceptable and unprofessional! I will no longer spend even $1 at Home Depot! If everyone would do this that has problems, maybe they would fix these issues!!! The end result should have been yes mr John we’re sorry for OUR mistake.

So as to avoid HD's censorship I will avoid using wrong words here, but Home Depot needs to cease carrying this STUFF. The 'black' is not black rock whatsoever. It is merely a thinly applied black coating over light grey rocks that when laid down in the yard will grey up almost before your very eyes. We purchased almost $600.00 of these, and within one short week now have sprinkles of grey stones that show up daily within the black rock! After picking them out daily, I went on line only to discover how disenfranchised (being polite here) Home Depots customers were with the product. Ignore the gratuitous and flowery comments in the customer reviews, as those are clearly plants done by HD, Black Forrest and/or the promoters of this shoddy product. The original 'Mexican black beach pebbles' were great. These knock offs are sheer garbage. Home Depot should truly be ashamed for even selling this product as clearly they know all of this.

WARNING as a heads up if you plan to do the same!First, the ""extra"" warranty that that tell you to buy because it will cover certain things such as scratches on the appliances or as the store rep put it ""if your kids scruff up your appliances"", etc. were LIES! They don't cover it, they ended up just giving us a $100 Gift Card for their ""mistaken info"" when we've already paid for the warranty!Second, their credit card website NEVER works, never lets you log in or reset your password, never sends a bill because you can't even get into opt out of paperless. You ALWAYS have to call in for the runaround and it still doesn't work! Good tactic so you'll never know how much you really owe!Third, their promo of no interest for 24 months sounded great! We paid a $4000 appliance package down to $2900 then they slapped on a $2500 interest amount due without notice after the promo ended, going back to the original balance due of $4000. So NOW we're back to square one with more to pay of $5400! Keep in mind, you can't even get into their website!! NOT WORTH IT unless you plan to pay everything off before the promo because the interest WILL go back to inception! Ridiculous!!!! IN A PERFECT WORLD, yes you would have checked when the promo was over and paid it all off when you actually received the bill or can get into their website! SAD EXPERIENCE all around!

You’re going to make a 60-year-old man with emphysema and no way to get it in the house struggle trying to lift it?

The dryer vent duct was so short that it would have been unsatisfactory under 90% of common situations. They brought no dryer vent duct tape. Fortunately I had some. The hoses to the washer was installed backwards and tried to keep for themselves the extra hoses I purchased and was listed on my order. They did not bring them up. They left them in their truck.

Day it was supposed to be here, got an email saying it was delayed and that delayed products “tend to ship within 5 business days.” No estimated date, just tend to ship. Tried to cancel the order because I would not be at the delivery address anymore but couldn’t because you only have a 45 minute window to cancel. Kind of hard when you don’t find out for 4 days that you are not receiving the product when delivered.

I requested a full refund and they haggled about it,said they would order the carpet,send to my home and I could choose any installer I wanted, I replied that this was not the fault of the installers,this was on HD and I was on the phone until they sent an email verification of refund receipt. Remember,4 weeks now, 208 square yds?Next day,I call Carpet Plus,bought carpet and 170 some sq yds not 208.

The Home Depot,Put a movie on,"Put a movie on and settle in for a chat you will never forget, time you will never get back. You can take a shower in between responses from the customer service agents.I chatted with an HD rep, trying to replace a Miter Saw Stand that broke when I was putting it together. For the purpose of this review of the atrocious Home Depot customer ""service"", I won't detail actually going to the B&M store, that is a whole different worthless experience. It's no secret that HD's customer service is horrible, but they won't even replace a broken Miter Saw Stand for the sale price of $99. They want to instead give me a ""discount"" off the original price of $219. I don't think so. Why even go there when they wont honor their sale price when an item breaks before it's even used the first time, and when it's within THEIR own 90 day return policy? Why does chatting take almost 2 hours? With their 353 BILLION dollar market cap, one would THINK they can HIRE some people! You can see how cheap they are refusing to replace my $99 Stand, so no, of course they won't hire more people.I hate Amazon, but I wish they would buy HD and eliminate them. Total chat time 322 PM to 505 PM. For absolutely nothing.",0,1

The Home Depot,No call no show on delivery date,"My delivery was a no call no show on 4/15/21. They never called me, emailed me or anything as to why they never showed up. They have a tracking system to follow your order on the delivery date. Around 7 pm it said I'm the next stop, appliance is on the truck, after the no call no show, on 4/16(the next day) it moved my delivery to 5/1. I have spoken to many different people from the store, appliance -delivery department, the HD credit company (so they are aware). Found out how it really works, they hire a third party for their appliances and for delivery, the 3rd party only delivers what they can that day (usually not finishing all deliveries) and the order gets pushed all the way back to the next delivery date available (they do not try to fit you in anytime before). After a long pointless conversation with the delivery department of HD, where the employee honestly could care less, I let him know I would be canceling my order. I'm on my way to Lowes (who has never pulled a stunt like this) to place an order and canceling the HD order. I would never recommend ever buying an appliance from HD. It's not worth your time and chances are you will be writing a review right along with the rest of us. (This occurred in Matthews, NC)",0,1
The Home Depot,The case of the missing Makita,"I would like to tell you about my new Makita string trimmer, but nobody seems to know what happened to it. I purchased it online and have paid for it already. I chose ship to store, hopefully to avoid any damages during shipping, instead of shipping to my home (last item, HONDA push mower, was damaged when I shipped to home). My trimmer was due to arrive on Friday and had been tracked to Monroe, Ohio. It was shipped to my store the night before and somehow got lost along the way (a distance of 40 miles to my local store) So somewhere between Monroe, Ohio and my local store (40 miles distance) my trimmer has been lost...I received an update and now my trimmer is scheduled to make it through those final 40 miles 5-7 days from now?? How can this be? I chose to buy this from Home Depot and get it delivered to my local store to avoid this type of problem. I now wish that I had just purchased it on AMAZON, as I usually do. I could probably be using my new Makita string trimmer if I had chosen AMAZON instead.",0,1

The Home Depot,AWFUL Customer Service,"Placed an online order for 2 identical bathroom exhaust fan/lights on 4/12/21 for N/C home delivery. Delivery was promised for 4/14/21. Delivery was a couple of days late on 4/16, no big deal, EXCEPT...Home Depot apparently shipped 2 units (based on shipping label info) but their carrier only delivered one of the two units.Called Home Depot online order toll free CS number and was placed in a queue that advised a 30 minute (!!!) hold time, but I could text for faster service (LOL!)Texted 38698 as directed by customer service phone message loop and company web site for the first time at 3:26 PM CDT on 4/16 with full order information and image of shipping label on the one item that was received. NEVER received a reply.Aggravated over lack of response, texted again at 8:03 PM CDT same date and initially received an automated reply from a ""Virtual Assistant"" (which is more than I got in the first place).Won't bore you with all the details, but after 40+ messages back and forth over a 2 HOUR period, I signed off with them at 10:07 PM CDT with NO satisfaction whatsoever.Home Depot's position was ""dispute the charge with your credit card company, our carrier said it was delivered.""Keep in mind, there was NO POD. No signature, no photo of the goods on the doorstep. If somebody was going to steal one of two identical, $110 bathroom exhaust fan/light units, they would have taken BOTH of them and not left ONE behind on the doorstep.So, I wasted over 2 hours in a futile text interaction with some poor Home Depot employee (or contractor in Bangalore, India or God knows where) who was juggling (what he/she said) was 5-7 customer text interactions at one time, but was completely unempowered to do ANYTHING to assure this customer's satisfaction.FINE. I'm DONE with Home Depot. Never was enamored with this chain store, but found a deal online for home delivery that seemed like a good value.Factoring in the time I wasted dealing with this company, I could/should have bought from a higher priced online vendor. Paying a bit more would have offset my wasted time and aggravation.The 2+ hours of my lost time are worth more than the $110 fan the vendor's carrier lost in transit.Worst revelation? Found out after the fact I could have purchased the EXACT same item from Amazon, with no hassle delivery and superior customer service, for $3 less than the Home Depot price.Caveat Emptor!",0,1

The Home Depot,We usually buy everything at Costco but…,We usually buy everything at Costco but they were out of the refrigerator I wanted so I ordered it through Home Depot. Worst mistake I have ever made and will never go back. I paid for them to move the old refrigerator into another room. When they came to deliver the refrigerator they wouldn’t move the old one because they said they would have to remove the doors. We were never told that maybe a possibility. So they left our old refrigerator in the middle of our kitchen. My husband is disabled and we can’t move the refrigerator on our own. The delivery men were rude to my husband and when I called Home Depot to complain I was told that they would not come out to do anything and if my husband is disabled I should have been home for the delivery which I could not do. We had to call a plumber to hook up the water which is a service that Costco provides. Something happened with the copper wire and we had a water leak. All of this is going to cost us thousands.

They screwed up the measurements and had to order a customer storm door. While they didn’t charge me for the screw-up, I only found out about this after three different emails went unreturned. Finally, got the phone call today (4/16), in which they told me the door was in but the soonest that they could schedule install is 5/11. I bought new doors because mine were broken/can’t close (or lock). Really, really disappointed with the lack of urgency and the lack of resolution. Not going back. I’ve already emailed stating that I’m expecting a full refund when I find alternative replacements, because this is unacceptable.

Only the manager and one other person could give me the keys. What should have been a 30 min purchase turned into an hour. Was never asked about warranty, she prayed over the computer because she said they system does not take checks but because she prayed it worked.

(4-15-21) I was in the store about 6:15 and looking to buy 40 Bags of mulch. The self service Check out was all that was open. A great Cashier (Hailey) was a great help in getting me through the checkout very fast! She greeted me with a big ""hello"". She was able to quickly locate the product I needed and even rang the sale for me. I had a gift card that she also used to complete the transaction and even wrote the remaining amount on the card for me. She asked if she could contact someone to help load the 40 bags of mulch for me. Which would be a great help also. The final Thank You along with the ""have a good evening” was also nice to hear! I just thought you should know as I have not had that good of an experience at a retail store in some time. The top of my receipt showed 4124(sale) 0051(cashier) and 13519 (Hailey).

The Home Depot,Worst customer service,"I placed an order on line thinking that was going to be a fast pickup and it turned out to be a waste of my company time, for starters nobody in the store knows the process to pickup and online order, from the service desk we were sent to the pro desk to wait for our order, we waited for 30 minutes and asked the pro cashier to call someone, she said someone would be right up, then we waited another 30 minutes and nothing, I then placed a call to the store and told the attendant we had been waiting in the area and that no one had come to the area to help with the pickup, finally after 1:30 hours a kid comes up and he had no idea of what needed to be done, we explained we are picking up an online order and he went to the back and 15 minutes later he comes back to get the order information and heads to the back again, finally he comes to us again after 10 minutes and asked us to follow him that they found the order, the a guy on the forklift demands to se the pickup ticket, we tell him that no one from the service desk gave us paperwork, he sends us to the pro desk and then the pro desk sends us back to costumer service, the lady in service desk had no idea what we were talking about and goes to find the forklift guy, she comes back and hands us a pickup ticket and tells us the order is ready at the pro desk, we finally get to the pro desk and the forklift guy just gets on another fork lift and drives away telling us that he has another pick he has to handle, we waited 10 minutes and finally decided to carry everything from the skid to the truck our selves. This is the Home Depot in Waukegan Illinois 60085, worst costumer service, the only reason I go there is because I would already know where to find the stuff, because the customer service has always been terrible.

The Home Depot,Applying for a Home Depot CC? Make sure it IS a  HD,"I am very disappointed in the Credit Card Service you provided when I opened my Home Depot account after I bought my home in December 2019 in Georgia.In February, 2020, I went into the HD in Fayetteville, GA to open an account to buy a washer and dryer for my new home. The card I was given was backed by a company called Genesis FS Card Services and is managed by the Bank of Missouri. I was given a $1,000 credit limit and paid the card off within about three months. Since then I have learned that your company does not ""recognize"" my card as being a Home Depot credit card. I discovered this when I left it home one day and tried to charge purchases to my account using my ID and having the card number with me. I could not. The HD system in the store did not recognize my account number, my name or my social security number. I am nowhere to be found in your system even though I opened an account in your store. Instead, I wound up putting the purchases on my American Express card. I have since learned ""actual"" HD cards are backed by Citibank.Recently, I decided to upgrade my kitchen and wanted to purchase new appliances. I called Genesis to get a credit line increase. I was told my HD card with Genesis does not allow for a credit line increase and that when I was approved for $1,000, that would be the maximum credit line I would have with HD. I opened this account because I wanted to be able purchase appliances and home goods. A refrigerator and stove would be over $2,000 which is why I was requesting the credit line increase. The account that I opened in Home Depot and which I paid in full and on time currently has a zero balance.Today I called Home Depot Customer Service and after a hold time of 33.25 minutes I finally spoke to someone. I told her my situation and she said I would have to open another Home Depot account! I then asked why would they give customers credit cards that have the Home Depot name and logo but are not recognized by Home Depot. Without responding, I was transferred to take a survey.As I said at the beginning of this letter, I am very disappointed in the service you have provided. Please reach out to me and tell me why I should continue to do business with Home Depot.",0,1

On Friday, April 9 I had not received any confirmation of delivery and had to call the 800 number and was told that a piece to the Dishwasher was now missing. I explained how could that be when just the microwave was missing prior? So they moved my appointment again said that it could be on Thursday I at that point informed them that I work and they would now have to work off of my schedule.

The manager got on the phone and it was of no help said that they cannot control the delivery. After waiting on the phone for more than 40 minutes between the manager and the delivery department I finally got a hold of the delivery team who informed me that they have no control over the delivery schedule that it’s all put into a system that gets them the best gas mileage upon their deliveries.

The Home Depot,Defective and Termite damage Lumber,"I work for an electric power utility plant that provides electricity for the greater Tennessee Valley area. Up until recently since the onset of covid I have worked 6 days a week and 12 hr nights to ensure everyone has power and electricity. I desperately needed to replace my worn out 600ft privacy fence. I ordered wood to be delivered so that I could replace a section at a time. I paid $79 delivery fee for $1400 of normal pressure treated 1x6x10, 2x4x10, and 4x4x10 to be delivered which home depot told me would have a two week lead time. Nearly all of the 1x6x10's had long cracks or splits length-wise down the center of the boards. Some of the 4x4's had large 2” to 3"" knots that had started to chip or had fallen out of the board. The real gem is one of the 2x4 has 2 large sections where termites had eaten portions of the board before the pressure treated chemical had been applied. It looks as if the manufacture of the wood saw this termite sections and just applied extra chemical in that area. I called home depot and just wanted them pick up the damage boards and bring some replacements. No harm-no foul, so I thought. I told my situation to the help desk in Atlanta and she informed the store. When the store manager called me she seemed to be on the defensive. She stated; ""well I looked at the pictures my delivery guy took when he dropped off your order, and I don't see any damage."" I explained that the order was not damaged in delivery, these are visible defects from the store. From her tone, obviously I did not know what I was talking about because surely Home Depot does not have poor quality product in its store. After about 30 minutes of what they can and can not do. They want to schedule the delivery guy to pick up the lumber (2 week lead delay), bring it back to the store for examination, process my refund for the damaged lumber, reorder the lumber, have me pay for another $79 delivery fee that would not arrive for an addition 2 weeks. I would have to wait another month without lumber and out of another $79. If I was truly interested in a customer who just wanted termite damage free lumber. I would have sent one guy in one of those company trucks they have, replaced the few boards that should have never been delivered to me in the first place. The whole trip to my home and back to the store would not have taken an hour. Now I am going to use my only off day to load and drive the entire order back to Home Depot for a full refund including delivery charges. I have been shopping at home depot for as long as I can remember. Over the years I have read reviews and witnessed a noticeable decline in the quality of product in the lumber they sell. It is common knowledge that out of every 4 pieces of lumber you may find one that is decent, not perfect, but decent. I will never shop at The Home Depot Madison Alabama 35757. Poor product quality is a direct reflection of the stores leadership team. Either leadership doesn't care about the quality of the item they sell, or they have no clue of what quality looks like.

Gas company and plumbing company both told me that Home Depot hires contractors all the time whose staff is not qualified to perform gas hook-ups. Very dangerous practice. Very disappointed in Home Depot engaging in this kind of practice. This could have easily caused an explosion and caught the whole house on fire.,0,1
The Home Depot,Worst Service Ever,"Purchase a dishwasher plus installation. When delivered, was told I needed a second appointment for installation.

Home Depot service is the worst.",0,1
The Home Depot,Only go there if you can help yourself.,"I like going to Home Depot only if I can help myself. I try no to bother with any employees as they seem to be tired of their lives and treat you as you are interfering.

The Home Depot,"ORDER CANCELLED, 3 TERRIBLE CS REPS, HOME DEPOT LOST MY $3,000.","I placed a phone order for a hot tub and heater cover over $3,000. After several days i called and they informed me the order CANCELLED. They send me junk mail daily, i have an account so they have my info. but my email was dropped on my order so i never received one. They told me the item is now out of stock so it cancelled. I used a coupon that saved $200 but it now expired. The 1st CS Rep was rude, told me it had been a long day and over talked me the entire time. He said he was able to reorder the heater cover but couldn't do anything else. Then he decided to transfer me to a survey without finishing the conversation or ordering the cover. I contacted again through text message and received another rep who was pretty much the same way. She also offered to reorder the heater cover. When I responded I waited an hour and a half for response back before I finally asked if we were still chatting. ANOTHER ONE CAME ON and said he would be taking over. He told me the exact same thing was yep your order had been canceled. He said he could reorder the cover as well. He also said he could transfer me to someone else. I told him no. After three Representatives who could not help get anything accomplished I did not need a fourth. I told him to forget about the heater cover and I would just spend $3,000 somewhere else. I have never had such terrible service at home Depot and will never spend that kind of money there ever",0,1

I tried to call Home Depot customer service so many times and could not get a hold of anyone....only recorded stuff. I finally managed to contact via online chat and they informed me that my order is in backlog and delivery will not take place in the next month!!! I understand delays, specially now with the pandemic. But it's totally uneceptable the lack of communication and how difficult Home Depot makes to reach an associate. This same order I had it cancelled initially because Home Depot failed to properly process my order with the correct billing and delivery information. Sooooooooooooooo disappointed and frustrated. We drove all the way from Southern CA to Utah to be at home for this delivery, and face this terrible customer service. Stay away from Home Depot. P.S.: Home Depot, my order # WG32565061.",0,1

This is their delivery company and guy was calling from his personal phone and did not leave a message who it was or that they were on the way or there which is nonsensical for a delivery company. They refused to come deliver later and could not explain why they did not leave a voice mail so I would know they were enroute or there.

I have spent hours on the phone trying to get my full refund with no effort on their end or calls back.

When it is still scheduled the day before I plan for it - then here I am, calling THEM the morning of, only to find out GE tells them it will be another 11 days before they have the item.

I see the boxes above but nobody wants to go look.I have come in every day for about a week and same thing. I asked the young kid in the paint section to see if the boxes stacked high contained the spray paint that I was looking for. I also asked if he had that tool that could say the same thing. His words? Ah... there is only one person who has that and they are not here.3. Went in the next day to the paint department and stood there for about 10 minutes. The tall young gal never looked at the place where you drop off your order. Not once. I thought how long is this going to go on. Then after 10 minutes couple walked up where you pick up your paint and she waited on them immediately. After that, she still did not look. Finally I spoke up and said, you need to know that I have been waiting long before they walked up. She then got really sarcastic. This is BS4. Went to self check and had spray paint. Of course it rings for help since they still think everyone is snorting it. The young person wanted my ID and I said no, she said we need it and I said no again. I said the last 3 years they manage to do w/o looking at my DL. I said fine and gave her a fake one. The she said I still need to see it and I said get me a manager, this is BS. Manager keyed in some codes and boom I was done. What in the hell happened to common sense. I knew what was going on, I knew she was new but at that point I had had it.5. Again shelves are not being stocked in a timely manner, nobody to ask anything.6. It is one thing to hire, quite another to tell them to use common sense.7. The one person that I think is very friendly and goes out if their way is Richard back in the light/electrical department. For gods sakes some give him a raise.8.

The gentleman finally turned around, and I was able to see that he was also an employee. I finally left. 2 days later I tried a different home depot. Lakewood, CA location. I told the gentleman working at the desk, that I wanted to purchase 1 or 2 doors dependent on the cost of door installation. Can you give me a rough estimate on how much it will cost to install a door. His response was, "" the guy 2 aisles down does it with 2 tubes of caulk"". I said what?. So you're telling me it only takes 2 tubes of caulk to install pre- hung doors?. He said yes. OMG. What about cost of installation.??.He never asked which doors, didn't mention locks, shims, trim. So I guess if I buy the caulking, my door installation is free?.I dont know if I was treated this way because they're probably not on commission, not well trained, or because I'm a woman.3rd attempt will be at Lowes.",0,1

My Golden Retriever was in back yard with me, when he got out of the trick he arrogantly yelled at me to go get that dog in the house, which I did. Then I told him the pedestal for the washer was in the garage and asked if they could bring it downstairs, again with a strong attitude he said no we cannot do that. Instead of politely saying, "" No I am sorry Sir we are not allowed to do that"" I told him with his attitude I am about ready to just have him leave. they both get on the truck and drive off without making a delivery. I called Home Depot and told them about the incident, they said they would credit my account. They showed absolutely no concern about the rotten customer service I got from delivery men.

The Home Depot,No accountability and no integrity. Shop somewhere else.,"I ordered John Deere S120, a tow behind cart for it and a protection package on March 18th, 2021. The cart showed up when it was supposed to. The mower was supposed be delivered with ""white glove"" service where they show you how to use it and whatnot on April 5th. It was April 3rd when I called to see what was going on since I'd had zero communication from Home Depot about what time they would show up to deliver. They couldn't locate where my mower was. I ended up calling back the next day (April 4th) to see if they found it yet. I was told that they couldn't get any tracking info from John Deere to be able to tell me where it was. I told them I couldn't afford to miss work multiple times to make sure I would be there for delivery and the delivery had to happen on the day they told me which was April 5th. The woman even said ""if the email said to expect it April 5th then you should expect it April 5th"". So I took the day off of work. I work 10 hour days and make 30+/hr and losing out on those hours will make it pretty difficult for me and my family during Covid times. April 5th comes around so I call around 10am trying to figure out when they should be to my house. I get told that the manager is going to get everything figured out and he would call me back with the info. 6 hours later I called back and got a different person who told me it recently showed up to the distributor and John Deere would call me the following day to set up a delivery since my mower wasn't fully assembled yet. I asked why they couldn't make the appointment now and needed to wait until tomorrow. She then calls John Deere back and this time they say my mower was damaged when in got to them. But, not to worry, they'll fix it and get it out to me asap. I told them I had paid for a NEW mower, not a refurbished mower and that it was unacceptable they didn't just have it replaced. They told me they would have to cancel my whole order and start a new one to get a NEW mower to me (resetting the lead time to a month before I get my mower). There is a Home Depot less than 10 min from my house with 6 S120 John Deere mowers sitting right out front but I have to wait 2 months to get one? Again, not acceptable. I asked if my choices were between starting all over or getting a refurbished mower at the new mower price and they said.... yes. Blew my mind! Didn't even offer a discount on the damaged one. After their mistake I'm out a mower, which I paid for and 10 hours of pay. I asked who was going to reimburse me for my lost wages and they offered me $100. Not even 1/3 of what it cost me in lost wages. Then told me I could cancel my order completely and get a refund plus the $100. I took a couple hours debating whether or not I should even go through with the order and ended up going with canceling it so I could just buy my mower somewhere else but still thought I was owed compensation for making me lose wages because of their error. I called to cancel and address the compensation part and the guy went through my cancellation process no problem but there was ""an issue"" with the compensation and I need to speak to the resolutions team. This was AFTER he cancelled my order. The woman I spoke with told me that they can't give compensation and the best they could do after trying to blame John Deere for the error is give me a $150 gift card TO HOME DEPOT! I never want to shop there again with how this went down. How is a gift card to a place I never want to shop at again fair compensation? They don't care about you. They want money and don't care about the average Joe who is going to struggle supporting his family with a paycheck $300+ short because of their errors. HOME DEPOT IS THE WORST.",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot’s Failure To Follow Manufacturer Recommendations,"So I go to the local Home Depot to purchase bulk sand (1,000lb bag). I notice it’s $5 more here than at Lowe’s, no biggie right. So when the cashier rings me up he adds another $15 onto this for a “pallet fee”. I inform him that I don’t need the pallet and they can keep it in which he replies that’s how they load it. Alittle confused I explain to him that you don’t load sand using the pallet but instead you use the straps that are made into the bag by the manufacturer. (The straps are how cranes lift this multiple stories off the ground everyday on job sites). He did not know this and says ok just to let the fork lift guy know. I go outside to get loaded and then have to explain this to the fork lift driver who refuses to load it using the straps on the bag and explains it’s store policy to only use the pallet and I’d need to remove my gate off my trailer and go pay the $15 for the pallet in which I can later drive back to the store and return. Annoyed by the level of stupidity I ask to speak to a manager. Keep in mind the manufacturer prints on this sand bag a list of ways to safely load their product. All of the ways include using the straps and nothing else. So the manager sticks to this that is corporate policy and not store policy and he can’t allow it. Annoyed even more I tell him he can refund the money and I’d take my business to Lowe’s where they will load it like normal human beings and will save you $20 in the long run in which Home Depot has marked the product up even more. Save yourself the headache of this company and stick to the normal Lowe’s for construction and home improvement products.",0,1

They arrived 2 weeks later, I got an email on how to prepare for my delivery and I followed all instructions. HD delivery agent arrives ahead of schedule 🤗, but can’t install because I have a backsplash made of tile. They can’t drill into my tile backsplash to install a bracket for the microwave! Who freakin knew they would not drill into my backsplash, who? That is a very specific issue, u would think someone would have called before to make sure of my circumstances before they came. It was so unprofessional to arrive and be unprepared for installation.

I asked the sales associate in the store were they sure I would have me refrigerator on that date, and if it was currently in stock. I told him I could have it delivered somewhere else just to make sure they didn’t sell my item. He assured me that I would have it. The day before my delivery, I was rescheduled a month out! Mar. 31 2021! I was upset because I was ASSURED I would have my item when I asked the associate. Against my better judgment, I went ahead and accepted the March date only to be told, (because I had to call myself and make sure) they had rescheduled me again for another month! April 30, 2021! I was livid. I asked why are they giving me dates but no products, I was told the item was not in stock and would be back in stock.

I ordered a product that was supposed to arrive on 3/31, but it hasn't even shipped yet. It even says on the order page that it was supposed to be delivered 4/1 (already different from what was advertised, but still), and today's date is 4/2. I wasn't given any notice about a delay in shipping, and I do not consent to a delay. Therefore, HD must give me a refund, but I've talked to around 5 associates now and they all claim that they ""cannot"" follow the law and give me my legally entitled refund. One even said they couldn't cancel my order since it hasn't shipped yet, which makes no sense! FTC Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule: The Rule, issued in 1975, requires sellers who solicit buyers to order merchandise through the mail, via the Internet, or by phone to have a reasonable basis to expect that the sellers can ship within the advertised time frame. The Rule also requires that, when a seller cannot ship within the promised time, the seller must obtain the buyer’s consent to a delay in shipping or refund payment for the unshipped merchandise.I've filed a claim with the FTC and I encourage anyone else in this situation to do the same, since it seems like their basic practice is to break this law.",0,1

The Home Depot,Treat people as People,"If I could give this experience no stars I would 1266 Omniplex Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45240. I am very disgusted with the way I was treated and the process of receiving a refund. I ordered a washer and dryer set on March 3rd, that were to be delivered March 15th the washer and dryer arrived damaged so they were refused and sent back by me. I was told someone would call me the next day because it was a late evening delivery. I waited until noon the next day and no-one called so I called the store I was told that I couldn't get a reschedule and I had to wait for a refund to hit my back acct. I thought this was strange but since I asked to speak to a manager I didnt think to question I just requested the refund not the reschedule and I was very clear. The gentleman told me that it would take 5-7 days to receive. On day 3 I received a call from the company stating what day my reschedule was for I stated it went under a refund and called the store to reconfirm and I was told yes it is coming as a refund. During this call and hold process I was told by someone when I stated that this process was starting to get ridiculous that "" well the equipment was sent and you sent it back"" Like I was supposed to take damaged property"" Really Home Depot do you by accept damaged brand new equipment? I mentioned that I would probably be taken my business elsewhere which is huge I live 3 minutes from Home Depot and now I am contemplating driving 2 extra miles to go to Lowes because of how I am being treated. I finished the complete 7 days and on day 8 (When I still had no money)called the store and was told no one had processed it as a refund but they would try to expedite it. I called got placed on hold for 20-30 minutes repeatedly was told the manager was not there and then in meeting...etc when I finally got to one she told me that I would have my refund by Monday 3/29 at the latest. Monday when I did not have my refund I called again and was told she was in Meeting so I had to go up there in person after work and talk to a manager, I waited so long and I ended up calling corporate on the spot and having a call with corporate and a manager who told me my refund was just sitting there and this could have been handled with out my time being wasted. So I completed the process to get my refund. I was told that maybe I could have a deal because of my inconvenience and I'm starting to be like ok maybe they care enough to see this was nuts experience. I was offered smaller units for the same amount of money. Home Depot, what would have been a great convenience is the same or bigger units with at least $200 off considering the fact I paid $1,869. and you've had it in limbo for almost a month at this point I finally received my refund March 31st.",0,1
The Home Depot,The Worst Experience with Home Depot #453,"My experience with The Home Depot, store #453, cross streets 91st ave and Peoria Ave, in Peoria, AZ have been the worst imaginable. I purchased an order for tile including installation and delivery. We had to pay up front of course. Before the purchase, I was receiving calls which I thought was home depot and they were asking that I pay now so they can get things started. Well, it turns out, it was not home depot, but their installation group. So once I found out, I asked Home Depot to not have other people calling me for something that we had not paid for first. We then pay for the order and it took about two weeks for the tile to come in. I asked to be kept informed, but I was not. I happened to call the day it was supposed to arrive and found out that evening that it had arrived two days before and it had to be ""picked"" is the term I was given. I assumed that meant checked in. I was eventually contacted and told that our order had arrived. We then had it delivered, which was part of the purchase. That $232.oo included placing the two pallets of tiles- 101 total boxes, inside our home. Well the delivery driver gives us a sheet that says they do not enter homes because of COVID, so two pallets were dropped off at our front door, so we had to unpack the pallets. Again, we paid for a service that we never should have been charged for according to the Store Operations Manager John Randall. He said we never should have been charged for that, but we were. Going back to the beginning, when the installers called us 3 or 4 times before purchase, well after getting the delivery, the installers never called to set up a date to start the installation. Well that was the last straw, so we rented a Uhaul and returned everything. Home Depot said the 232.00 has to be issued by a check from the home office. We have been in contact with the home office in Atlanta and the experience has been pretty much the same. Transferred from one person to another, being hung up on at least three times. I now have to spend time looking for an attorney because it seems Home Depot is trying to stiff us the money for the delivery that we never should have paid for and I have all the receipts. Along with the receipt from the delivery group stating they do not come into homes because of COVID. We did get the money back for the tile and installation, but yet to get the money for the delivery we were charged. Safe to say, we will not spend another penny at any Home Depot. Not even worth the one star, but we had to leave something.",0,1

They're telling me that they need to open a case with Fed Ex and that they won't issue me a replacement order or refund my money until their investigation is closed. I asked when that will be and they couldn't tell me. Then, Fed Ex called me because Home Depot gave them my phone number. I'll be expecting my phone to get robo-calls since fed Ex sells phone numbers. Fed Ex tells me that they're behind and don't know when they can finish an investigation.

I've asked both when I can expect a replacement or refund to go purchase my own. Neither will give me an answer. By then, my garden will be destroyed without fence posts to keep the critters out.

I measured the space of my the refrigerator, it could fit easiest with plenty of space, other options could also be lifting it over the railing as there was plenty of space above as well or remove the doors. The whole process took less then 5 mins and they left. No attempts was made. After multiple phone calls, I was able to convince them to do it without removal but the reschedule time frame was another week.Every thing is different, don't ever assume due to a similar experience.Horrible serves and terrible experience.If you need something fast or emergency, this is not the place.",0,1

The Home Depot,They shady,I had a quote from wny instalation services. He quoted me $936. I asked for a breakdown of the cost he simply said the window was $500 and change rest went for installing. It was 41x36 picture window. The deal sounded shady so I called Home Depot. They found me a better window (Andersen brand) and the cost was $290. Watching Mike Holmes paid off. I did my homework. That deal was not only shady is was blantanly price gauging. I may buy the window and install myself. But I would never use their install service.,0,1

The Home Depot,POOR DELIVERY TRUCKING COMPANY/HOME DEPOT,"Don't buy the appliance at HOME DEPOT. We ordered a washer and dryer on Feb 7th, to be delivered the next week. We received notification that they had to move our delivery date (due to covid, i'm sure) So, we waited patiently for that delivery date... only to have the delivery guy come half way up our driveway and announce that he can't make it the rest of the way in his truck (he didn't want to try) AND, that he wouldn't be able to hook up the gas dryer that we paid to have installed (because it was propane- again, a service that we paid for) So, they moved our delivery date out another 17days. Our new delivery date was now on March 27, 2021. So, we waited patiently again. We didn't receive a notification the day before, so we decided to call the morning of the 27th - only to find out that the trucking company had totally cancelled our order. Of course, our $2,600 wasn't refunded... just cancelled our order with no notification. WAKE UP HOME DEPOT - YOUR TRUCKING COMPANY SUCKS!

The Home Depot,If you want to spend thousands of $$$$ only to receive no product-shop here. Otherwise stay far away from this nightmare of a company.,"I would give zero stars but I am forced to at least select one.I purchased a refrigerator on Black Friday 2020. It was never delivered. I called in January 2021 and asked about delivery. The rep in major appliances basically blamed the late delivery on Covid. He spoke to me as if I were a bothersome woman that was wasting his time for having the nerve to question the delivery of a nearly $3000 purchase. He said the new date delivery would be March 9.On March 8, I called HomeDepot's appliance number because I did not want to talk to ""Mr Helpful"" at the local store again. I was told that Home Depot had a system wide mess up on Black Friday and that my order had fallen through the cracks. The gentleman told me I would have to cancel my order and then reorder. I mentioned that the fridge had risen significantly in price. He assured me he would match the price and give me an additional $150 off for my trouble. I said I could not afford to purchase the item again until I saw the credit to my card. He said I could call back anytime and receive the price match and promised discount.On March 22, I called again because my order showed no changes. The representative assured me he would cancel and reiterated the original rep's promise of a price match and additional $150 off.On March 26, I finally saw a credit for the purchase made in Nov 2020, (Yes, 4 months after an order that was never completed. I basically gave Home Depot a 4 month interest free loan. I purchased in good faith and Home Depot failed to deliver and frankly did not care.)After seeing the credit, I naively called to repurchase. After several hours on the phone, home depot REFUSES to follow through on their promises. The refrigerator has jumped over $1000 since I purchased it on Black Friday. I purchased in good faith, home depot failed to deliver, and they continue to screw me over. The last person I spoke with acted as if she were doing me a favor by offering $500 off the current price. She said the manager at the Cinco Ranch Home Depot could not follow through on the promises made because it would hurt his bottom line. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? All I wanted was the refrigerator I purchased on Black Friday.Shame on me for trusting Home Depot. Shame on me for ever stepping foot in this lying, thieving establishment.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this store.",0,1

I know Home Depot cares about it's customers and property but these guys are literally going to cause Home Depot to lose value in customer relations, respect and supplies. And I'm sure Home Depot will be getting more reports if not already. it's disrespectful to the customers, and to Home Depot as a business.

The Home Depot,"Goodbye, Home Depot","I ordered a kitchen appliance suite in January on-line. It couldn't be delivered/installed until March. When my delivery date came, we were expecting a big snow storm so I was told the appliances would NOT be installed. The microwave was left in the original shipping so as not to be damaged. Meanwhile I had a maze of old and new appliances in 3 rooms of my house. They couldn't install until Tuesday and the installers thought of an excuse to not install the microwave again and come back on Thursday when the refrigerator would be delivered. Again the microwave was not touched and still in the original shippers box. On Thursday, now 5 days later, not to my doing, the delivery people brought the fridge and went to install the microwave and notice it was damaged to the point of needing a new one. I contacted Home Depot that day and was told it was past the 48 hours since delivery. I explained what happened and was only given 15 minutes notice that the appliances would not be installed. Apparently, after being told that day, the next day, and Monday by three different people that it would be replaced because of extenuating circumstances nobody thought I needed to know that Samsung denied the return. Home Depot decided it would not honor that it would be replaced either. I recourse was for me to load it in my car and take it to the store to return the microwave and buy it elsewhere. I am now without a microwave and this took 3 installs/ several hours on the phone with empty promises/ having to find another store that carried a matching microwave/ and 11 days of appliances all over my house with no thought of my inconvenience. This was my LAST purchase with Home Depot. I would not recommend Home Depot to anyone and will be repeating what I was told when I was told NOT to go through Home Depot. I should have listened.",0,1

The Home Depot,Attempt to buy a Fridge,"This is the 3 weeks (and counting) journey of attempting to purchase a refrigerator. I am posting on behalf of my parents, as they don't have social media. On March 8th, their fridge crapped out. They went to a couple of stores and decided on an LG fridge at this Home Depot. They were told it would take 2 weeks for it to arrive and they had to have a shut off valve for the water line inside. Fine, it was still cold outside that coolers and ice outside could hold some food, and more importantly, my dad's insulin. 2 weeks pass and the delivery man shows up with the fridge. My dad goes downstairs to shut off the water and the guy tells him that the shut off valve has to be behind the fridge and he's not allowed to hook up a fridge to copper pipes. Something they were never told at the store. He ends up leaving. They call a plumber and spend over $300 for a new shut off valve and plastic piping. Even though your own website states to DIY, the piping can be copper and the shut off valve is not required to be behind the fridge unit. So, this is Gripe #1. They spent over $300 on what they are now told, is false information. Gripe #2. You couldn't come back out until after the weekend, so 3 more days. 3 guys show up and start to install the fridge. They get it all set up, turn the water line on and it completely starts leaking and filling the bottom drawer with water. They decide they can leave us the half broken one with the water line off and send another one. Except the fridge is not getting cold. So, after 2 1/2 weeks, you sent a broken fridge. They call the store yet again and explain they need a working fridge as it's getting warmer and my Dad's insulin must stay cold. They send a little dorm fridge. They then come to the conclusion that they will deliver the floor model to the house while my parents wait ANOTHER 2 weeks for their permanent fridge. That was supposed to be delivered today. Even though they spoke to a woman - 7 hours after she said she would call by - last night, she never mentioned the delivery truck has been in the shop. So surprise, surprise, still no fridge. Now it ""should"" be here tomorrow. The belittlement and apathy from every person spoken with on the phone and the aggravation of all of the inconvenience is unreal. Spending $3K on a fridge and being told incorrect information leading to spending hundreds more is an unacceptable business practice. They have never bought an appliance in your store before and they, nor I, will ever do so again.",0,1

It is 2 and a half weeks and I am STILL WAITING for a new unit to show up.

She couldn’t find it so she said she would call me back the following day; she did not. The next day I called my local HD and talked to the store manager Kim who said “it looks like somebody dropped the ball.” This has now become the worst situation ever. I have talked to least 5 different HD employees. My local HD in Gainesville Florida was supposed to call me back but never did. I intend to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.

The Home Depot,Would Not Take Pallet Back,"I had a delivery of bags of salt, fertilizer, garden soil - $184 worth...+$79 for delivery. I asked driver to take back pallet... I stripped everything off from it and tried to hand it to him and he refused to take it. Shut the gate of his truck...left me standing there and drove off and waved to me. I am 74 with a heart condition and disassembling the pallet is not easy for me... do not have a truck. He had plenty of room in his truck to take back the pallet. Would not expect him to clear off the pallet and take it, but I cleared it off and brought it to the back of his truck before he left... small thing for most, big deal for me and I felt that in this instance he could have taken the pallet back. I called Somersworth Home Depot and an employee told me that they cannot take pallets back as they have other things to pick up and need the room. This truck was 3/4 empty and I paid $79 and only live 2.5 miles away. That is the last time I will order a delivery from Home Depot. Whatever happened to a little courtesy?",0,1

An employee in the garden center, who was doing some clean up showed me where to find them but stated that there weren't many left because they had a run on them this past weekend. I told him that I had seen one on their website for $80.00 and asked if there were any left. Unfortunately that item had been sold out. This employee, who I later learned was the store manager, Derek, showed me another wheelbarrow that listed for $160.00 and said that I could have it for the 80.00 I was going to pay for a smaller wheelbarrow I was originally going to purchase. He stated he felt bad because I had been inconvenienced. Not only that but he still have me my veterans discount and thanked me for my service. Needless to say I was very great tho.

The Home Depot,Two months without a washing machine due to their miserable systems,"I moved into a new house, and needed a washer dryer. I order a first time on Feb 8th, schedule a delivery, see the charge come through, and think all is good! A day before the delivery, I get a mysterious email saying my order was canceled and to call customer service. I call, and they say it was cancelled due to a payment issue and needs to be replaced. I'm baffled, as the charge has already cleared my credit account, but ok, I think they just need to update the credit card and retry. Not the case. The customer service agent starts manually searching for each item on their website, 'LG 4.5 gallon front load washer dryer"" slowly typing and scrolling looking for my things.. apparently there ordering system is so antiquated they have no way of updating an individual piece of information? I make some excuse to get off the phone and replace the order myself much more quickly using this modern feature called copy/paste. Two days later, I get a call from the associate at the local store, hey your order has been cancelled and I need to replace it. I just went through this, and got it resolved, what the heck? after some back and forth with the associate, we figure out that the issue is not a billing issue at all (recall that now I have two cleared 2800$ charges on my account), but a delivery zip code database mismatch (I live in a rural county, and have different zips for USPS vs FedEx). I replace the order over the phone, and think all is good. Delivery guys show up the next week with two washing machines. turns out the guy on the phone entered the wrong sku. The delivery guys say I need to have the whole thing returned and replaced, they can't do a partial delivery. So i do that. only now the machine is backordered. So i schedule a delivery for march 23rd (process started on february 8th). On march 22nd, they change my delivery date to the following saturday?! without telling me. Like I'm going to give up a weekend for their terrible incompetence. Closest laundromat is 45 minutes away. No way to get a hold of anyone who can understand even the basics of the situation, just ""there was a billing issue"". incompetency all of the way through the system. So now I'm two months sleeping on dirty sheets while Home Depot's CEO is getting smoke enemas every morning, and theres no way to send them an email, just 'call this number'. Serious flaws.",0,1

It certainly took my money. However, I then was notified that I had to pick up the items ordered from 2 separate Home Depot stores. Inconvenient but not impossible. However, that is absolutely not what happened! After arriving at the first pickup location on Woodruff Road, Greenville, SC I was informed that the items were on order and would not be available for 3 weeks! I needed them now! I would have gone to a different store if I had known. I asked that they please reverse the charge and I would go elsewhere. No. Absolutely no. They could not do that! I would have to wait until the items were in to return them! Are you kidding me?! No, there was nothing they could or would do! $372 out of my account has to wait 3 weeks or more to ship so that I can return for a refund. After trying, begging, pleading for help, the manager finally decided to reverse a charge and allow me to buy the exact same thing in the store but with a different sku number! So, I thought she finally canceled the order and credited my account! No! She canceled my second pickup location instead and recharged my account. However, the later charge was unbeknownst to me. So I proceeded with buying the same exact items that were on order that were actually in the store under a different sku. So I paid for the same items now 3 times!!! Absolutely the worst and rudest customer service that can not get the refund correct! And me too! Idiot, I believed them! I then went to the second location to pick up the remainder of the order to be informed that the only items canceled was that order but it was NOT NOT NOT REFUNDED!! THE ONLY THING I COULD DO ACCORDING TO MY BANK, HOME DEPOT CORPORATION HEAD QUARTERS AND THE Greer, SC Home Depot was to spend more money to get the remainder of the order! So here it is 5 days later... I have now been charged 3 times for the first location pickup and twice for the second and I only have 3 fold up tables which has now cost me over a thousand dollars!! I can't make this stuff up! I now have checks bouncing and can no get any help!

The Home Depot,"The dishwasher is great, but Home Depot is not","The Whirlpool dishwasher (Model #WDT730PAHZ) is great! My low rating has nothing to do with the dishwasher itself, but rather with the Home Depot employees that I was forced to interact with after the delivery of the dishwasher. Long story as short as possible, when our dishwasher was delivered, the delivery guy informed us that the cord and adapter kit they sent was not what we paid for (we paid for a 5ft cord/adapter, they sent a 3ft cord/adapter) and that these items were not long enough for him to connect everything up. He also informed us that he could not wait for us to go to our local Home Depot and purchase the 5ft cords/adapter (that we had already paid for) again. As a result, we were left with the new dishwasher in the middle of our kitchen and a hole where the old dishwasher used to be. So, I called Home Depot and was connected to a customer service rep ""Dawnisha"". And I use the term ""customer service"" very loosely in this instance. From the start of our conversation Dawnisha was rude. She didn't want to listen to anything I had to say and attempted to overtalk me as often as possible. By the end of our conversation she was d**m near belligerent. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor because it was clear that she had no intention on attempting to find a solution to the issue. After about 15 minutes on hold (I'm sure she thought I would become frustrated and hang up), she finally connected me with a supervisor (I think her name was Michelle) whose idea of a solution was to have someone place the 5ft cord/adapter on hold for us to pick up and to reschedule the installation for another 7 days out. Meanwhile, I guess we were supposed to just squeeze around the dishwasher sitting in the middle of our kitchen for another 7 days. We ended up contacting a plumber (shout out to Stephen at GM Pro Plumbing in Concord, CA) who came out within 2 hours and hooked our dishwasher up. Home Depot did refund the fee we paid for the cord/adapter (because we had to buy it again) and the installation. We still will never purchase anything from them again. ***Home Depot has rejected my review on their website multiple times. I wonder why?***",0,1

A call to Home Depot resulted in a visit a week later by a tech from the installation company who admitted the faucets were broken and my daughter would hear from their office. No one called or emailed. She called their office and was told she would get an email stating how they would handle the damage. No one ever emailed. She hired a plumber to replace the faucets and he found the hot/cold hoses were reversed. Cost:$120. At least she now has use of her $1000 machine. She will now pursue reimbursement.

They said they would sent a message to whirlpool to confirm that they don't have a time frame for part so they can send it to Disbursement/ reimbursement unit so then they can either replace or buy back the dryer asked me to give them 2-3 business days. It is now March 23,2021 they never called me I called them and they transferred me supervisor who just told me the same thing again to wait 2-3 business they were going to send it to whirlpool to confirm that they have no time frame for part so they can send it to disbursement/ reimbursement unit I told her really this is what I was told last time she said she didn't know why they told me that because it wasn't done so I told her really I have to still wait another 3 days she said yes... This place has lousy customer service lousy warranty and home depot should know this already. Never Again will go to buy from home depot.",0,1

The Home Depot,I chose Home Depot to complete my…,"I chose Home Depot to complete my kitchen remodel. Initially the process was great. However, the subcontractor provided by HD who installed the countertop did a horrible job. They were difficult to work with immediately. They made it clear their time was more valuable than mine when trying to schedule. The man who did the measurements was rude to me and my main contractor. The install though was terrible. One slab was cut at a wrong angle and did not butt up to the stove, at places leaving a gap of almost 1/2 an inch. The same on another slab. I was told the seam wouldn't be noticeable, but there's a ridge and it's not level with the neighboring slab. (I was told the seam should be polished down till it can't be seen or felt) the slab for the sink is where it's really unjustified below industry standard work. The hole for the sink was cut so far back, the faucet can't be installed. He cut the hole for faucet anyway knowing this. They told me I could remove my window frame. To make things worse, the installer drug dog poo into my house. I don't have a dog. Immediately I called the store. Logan asked I provide photos, which I did and was told, in writing, it was below standards and would be looked into. I never heard back from the store. I called corporate and was connected to Erika. She actually laughed when I told her everything. I was contacted by the installer who sent their manager to the house to inspect, again my schedule was inconvenient for them. He attempted to spin me but admitted it was poorly done. I was later contacted by someone at the installation company via email and was told it was not properly installed and needed to be replaced. Erika at Home Depot corporate also sent me an email saying it would need to be replaced. I was then contacted by Adrienne at the store who involved a guy named Steve. They told me they'd give me any faucet I wanted and financial compensation for my troubles. I want to note Steve was aggressive and attempted, in my opinion, to try to bully and intimidate me. The call dropped. I emailed Erika and accepted the new install, the faucet and financial compensation I was offered. She responded in writing the next day telling me I had two options: $500 and I just deal with the poor quality work or they will come install a faucet I provide at my expense and they'll give me $200 for the inconvenience. I responded I expected they honor their original resolution offers. She responded it was not negotiable. I have filed a law suit in order to recover my money. In the mean time, I live with a kitchen that is not fully functional. It's costing me money in a variety of ways from eating out, bottled water, lost wages to my other workers, etc. Plus the inconvenience of having to do dishes in my bathroom for over two months now and my house in disarray and it will still be a while before its resolved. Home Depot has made it clear they don't think I'm worthy of quality work and they are an unethical company.",0,1

The Home Depot,Well basically I was fired yesterday…,Well basically I was fired yesterday for being white. After dealing with a problem customer I made the mistake of ranting to a couple of other employee's. While I commented on the vagary's of all race's one of the other employee's decided to get upset about me quoting a Chris Rock's HBO special. I did not call anyone names but they went to corporate HR who told me that while it is ok for Chris Rock to say that (a Black Man) it was not ok for me to repeat it because I am white. I was then fired three days later. I had worked there for over a year with never even a write up and never having missed a day. my biggest question is why was it only about repeating something a Black comedian said and no one cared that I said the same thing about Whites Indians and Mexican's. To reiterate the problem was I am white and as such I am not allowed to repeat things a black person has said. It does not get any more racist than this.,0,1

I believe it was Geddy who has excellent customer service-thank you. Looked everywhere for the missing 11 lawnmowers. Found them. One was assembled and the rest were in crates. The assembled one had a ripped seat. Seats are $400 to replace. A $50 discount won’t cut it. We were offered to put our own together at no discount.🤐 so two twist nuts and seat switched. Larry was so angry and upset he forgot he was still at work😳 Keagan profusely apologized again and again. Thank you! Candy seamed nice enough. And the curly haired lady that helped unlock tractor and ran fork lift- really needs to be where Larry is..not in customer service. Finally got mower loaded after a grueling looonnnng wait. I’d say the worst time I have had in a very long time. As a Manager in retail I’m quite disappointed.☹️ 10 stars for Keagan and Geddy!!!!,0,1

The Home Depot,"Lousy customer service, Unprofessional employees and no product delivered as promised","I only left a single star due to no other option lower for a far lower rating. We ordered $350 worth of lumber via Home depot web site. Using the local store in Wichita. Several days later the lumber never arrived. Calling the local store which the order was placed the Wichita store said it was sent to a city an hour away out of our area (Hutchinson). Instead of that store fixing the issue MAKING SURE THE CUSTOMER WAS SERVED, they passed it to the Hutchinson store. Calling that store they said it would be delivered, it never arrived and no phone call explaining why .It resulted in being told the order would arrive the next day and we would be phoned when the driver was close. AGAIN It never arrived... Instead NO HOME DEPOT employees phoned us of any issues but let the order sit in their location untouched. Several days went by, Neither the Wichita KS east store nor the Hutchinson KS store employees would ""fix"" the mix up from their own defunct system leaving us the customer in the dark having to call and find out we wasn't going to receive any order from our Local store nor the Hutchinson location. Instead home depot swept us ""under the rug"" and when asked simply passed the buck not taking blame. NO offers were given from Home Depot employees to resolve the issue. We called the 1-800 home depot customer service and canceled the order So much for customer service... Still needing the lumber but again never offered a resolved option to receive such. To add insult to injury so to speak, The Hutchinson store passed it off as Wichita east store passed the issue off to the west Wichita store. No product delivered . Sad the company cannot work out internal issues but only blame the customer for ordering it on their own official Home Depot web site. After several weeks we was actually able to get a LIVE person on the Home Depot online .com and finally had the lumber canceled. However, The poultry wire we had ordered Originally coming out of Illinois to K.C then to Wichita and the FEDEX driver not delivering it, Then back to Kansas city. For more drama it is now off to Orlando FLA for no apparent reason (other then having a nice round trip vacation) thanks to Home Depot shipping it through FEDEX. Another bumbling bunch of incompetent boobs. Sadly, Now again we are trying to get help from a live person at the Home depot .com customer care (which obviously doesn't exist) without any resolution for the second half of our online Home depot order. My advise is DO NOT order online! only direct from their store if you ""just have to"" shop there. No customer service what so ever. The automated nut screen will shuffle you around and then hang up. Beyond real, welcome to clown world.",0,1

The Home Depot,Never Again,"Never AgainNEVER under any circusmtances should you buy an appliance, especially a washer at the Home Depot. Completely incompetent, unprofessional to the point I threw the delivery guy out of my house when he started taking pictures and wanting me to sign for something he did not install.The story. We bought a new washer online, it said it came with free installation. OK, great. It is being delivered by JB Hunt, not a professional plumber these days... just a delivery company... that they tell me is licensed and qualified to do the install, but they dont want to install... because it is going on the second floor and requires a drain pan to be installed. I had the drain pan there, which simply needed the hole drilled out of the pan and the drain plug screwed in and then put down into the outflow pipe in the floor. Now rightly or wrongly, I assume when they tell me “everything is included, there is nothing I have to do”I assume that 5-10 minutes is included. It is not.OK, I’m a little pissed at this point but I tell the driver if he can give me about 10-15 minutes to gather my tools, I can put the drain pan in... I mean I could have done it yesterday or this morning, but “everything is included,” so I hadnt done it.He tells me he don’t have time to wait, he will just leave the machine and I can pay a plumber to do the work. No, I tell him, you are supposed to do the install. At that point as he is talking, he pulls out his phone and starts taking pictures of the install area and tells me he will hook it up, but I have to sign a form saying that if it leaks, I will be responsible. Responsible for what? If he puts a hose on wrong or loose, or if the machine is faulty and leaks, I’m going to be responsible? I tell him Im not signing anything. He can either hook it up, or take the maching back with him. Instead, he called someone on the phone who told me there was nothing she could do and they needed me to either sign for him to hook it up, or they would just leave the machine there and I need to call a plumber and pay for that. What? Free install? What does that mean? To Home Depot, apparently it means plugging in the machine and screwing two hoses into place. Hoses by the way they required us to buy in addition to the machine, when our old stainless steel hoses would have been just fine.So because he couldnt wait 10-15 minutes for me to install the drain pan... and as he started once again to take more pictures, I told him to get out of my house and if he took one more picture, I was going to take his phone and literally throw him out... I now considered him trespassing. Did I forget to mention they knocked the pictures off my wall bringing the machine in and didnt even apologize or ask if they were Ok. Luckily for them, the pictures were fine.After phone calls to Home Depot’s escalation department, Im told the unit cannot be returned unless it is defective. The word buyers remorse was used. I don’t have buyers remorse, I need the washing machine but I want it hooked up like its supposed to be or I want to return it and Ill buy one from a more reputable service company. Too bad, Im told. no returns. Call the local store and talk to the manager Im told. So I did that.That was several hours ago and I still haven’t heard back. No one... not a single solitary soul who I spoke to at Home Depot gives a flying .... about their customers... so I can assure you, I am never setting foot in a Home Depot again.Don’t worry, I have installed the drain pan myself, hooked up the washer and the first load is in. It is all easy enough to do ones self... but that is not the point. No one should have to deal with the ignorance I encountered today... from both the people at JB Hunt Trucking and Home Depot. Consider yourselves warned.",0,1
The Home Depot,On February 26th 2021,On February 26th 2021. I had a water heater installed from Home Depot. The contractors from Home Depot install the water heater. But the contractors put the pipes on incorrectly. So now I don't have any hot water. They sent out another plumber from Home Depot. He put the pipes on correctly but I still do not have any hot water. That plumber was trying to tell me that I have Plumbing issues. But I was not having any Plumbing issues until they put in the water heater. I have talked to other plumbers they have let me know by them put in the pipes on incorrectly they damaged the water heater. But Home Depot will not send out a new water heater or give me a refund. Because they are not trying to fix this problem that they caused. I have a water heater that is not giving me any hot water. They sent out incompetent plumbers that damaged the water heater. I wish I had come to the site before I went to Home Depot to purchase this water heater and to use their plumber. I will tell everyone that I know do not shop at Home Depot because they use incompetent contractors. I hope no one else has this problem with Home Depot.

There was quite a bit of trouble in finding the order. I was kept waiting for several minutes while the workers made several different phone calls without so much as an apology for keeping me waiting. When the workers needed an order number for something, they asked me in a very rude manner without saying please and they talked over me when I tried to ask a question. When they finally managed to find my order, I asked where I should go to pick it up or where the service people would be delivering it. I wanted to know if I would have to carry it out myself and other things someone would want to know. They said they ""didn't know"" and that I should go ask ""down there."" They directed me to a different department in the store.

I figured I was going to lay flooring in my bedroom and take the day off. So I go to home Depot to pickup the flooring and a order I completed online previously. I get the flooring and put it on a push cart, I pickup my paint and go to the register. I get up there and realize I don't have the payment form I wanted to use but its in my wallet on my iphone. Of course Home Depot doesn't except Apple Pay. So I sit on the stack of flooring and decide to complete an online order. I'm watching these home depot clerks watch me but really not caring at all about them. I finally purchased the flooring online and then I self checkout the remaining items I have. I asked Flow(home depot clerk) if she can release the items I just purchased online? She said no, so I started walking back to the customer service desk. Then Flow(home depot clerk starts walking beside and within 6 feet of me and starts asking to see my receipt. I thought she was pointing at the drill I purchased online, I sd oh, I showed the other lady the receipt. So she asked again with a raised voice and I sd no ur not getting that receipt again, not even thinking she was talking about the flooring. She put her hand on the hand cart as to slow it down and immediately said your not leaving with it. Now keep in mind I was walking in the door down the main isle of home depot and I did not try to exit the exit that was right in front of the cash registers I just left. I was so confused but did not slow down. Oh and I was going really slow because that cart was heavy. I got to customer service desk Flow(home depot clerk) stood in front of my cart and applied pressure while calling someone on a phone. I handed the clerk behind the desk my phone to give her my order number so she can release the flooring order. That's when I lost it. Flow, the home depot clerk who I see almost everyday assumed I was stealing the flooring. But why? Was it my hoodie I had on with my hood up or my black skin? When I tell you I am a regular fixture in Home Depot, it would be putting it lightly. I love some home depot! It's my mall! Why would I be walking back in the store if I was stealing it? Remember I was at the cash register which was right in front of the front door. How exactly was I going to steal 12 boxes of 30lbs each flooring that was 40 inches long. To say I lost it would also be putting it mildly. I tried to calm myself down but between the crying, the anger and the thought of me not visiting my favorite store for lunch was a lot. The customer service clerk tried to help by acknowledging who I was and that I am a regular, but I ignored her as well. It hurt so bad I just wanted to scream and even when I gave the customer service rep my order number, Flow still wasn't done and went behind the counter and checked the purchase. I spend a lot of money in Home Depot and refrained from getting a home depot cc because how much I love to shop in home Depot. Mann I am tired of all of this! How about ask me questions that don't insinuate I'm stealing!",0,1
The Home Depot,3 months after purchasing - no carpet,Three months after they took 90% payment still no carpet. First installers canceled because they had no carpet. Second time installers no showed and called the next day to say someone was sick with covid. OFFERED TO COME THE NEXT WEEK?! We told them - no. Come and install it a month later if there was potentially a covid case. Third time - installers have a window of 2-6. We schedule around this. We get a call around 345 that the window will be 4-6. Ok. We get another call around 5 that they will come at 6... They show up at 6pm. Installers are tired. They ask if they can come back the next day because they are tired and it will take them 3-4 hours...As if we didn't have to clear our schedule for them 3 times already. No. HD is not cheaper than another local company. They sure as heck don't have better service and don't respect your time.,0,1

The Home Depot,How to get Home Depot to pump out $200 gift cards,"Cedar Rapids Home Depot was horrible to myself and my parents on two separate occasions. My parents bought a dishwasher, stove, microwave, and refrigerator and upon delivery they only delivered the stove. My parents were told that Samsung deleted their order and that’s why they didn’t get the other appliances. They had to go back into the store and pick out something else and wait again for them to deliver it.My wife and I ordered a vanity from them and it took 6 weeks for them to get it delivered to the store. When we were designing the cabinet layout, my wife said we want a 1” overhang on the left and the sinks centered in the middle of the left and right cabinets. During the design, Felicia “the cabinet expert” put a 3” filler between 1 of 3 of the cabinets and one against the wall. I said to her that we only want a 3” filler on the right side against the wall and nothing between the cabinets. Her response was that we can put fillers anywhere we want and move everything around, if we don’t use that filler, we could bring it back for a refund. After we received an email telling us our cabinets have arrived, we called and asked if “everything has arrived” and we were told yes that everything was ready for pickup. That was false. The countertop, side splash, and kickplate was not with the cabinets. We then spent the next week talking to multiple managers trying to find out countertop. It took going into the store to talk to a manger face to face. We were told that Home Depot screwed up the SKU number and the vendor did not make the countertop. We were told that they are going to “expedite” the process. Well we waited 4 more weeks for the “expedited” process until we started calling and asking where the countertop was. We were told that they can’t find it, the truck broke down, the truck was frozen, the truck was diverted for weather, and it is loaded and shipping now. All those answers were given from different managers across multiple days. Finally, the countertop arrived and when we went to install it on the cabinets Home Depot designed, IT DIDN’T FIT! We called Home Depot again to tell them, we were told it was on us because we signed off on the design. I said that we have never designed a vanity before, and this is not what we asked for anyway. Their response, “This is on you because you signed off. You can come back into the store and we can order it again for a discount if you would like.” We then asked what we should do with this hunk of crap laying on the floor that wont fit. They said it would cost us a 20% restocking fee to bring it back. We then reached out to corporate to have a conversation about how this Home Depot was conducting business. I was able to talk to Mrs. Sontal Jackson-Ferrell with the Executive Escalation team. Her way of “fixing” the situation was to offer a $100 Home Depot gift card for our troubles. I responded that I do not want the gift card, I would like to have a professional conversation about how my family was treated and how they are conducting business. I also included that $100 does not compensate me for my time, frustration, fuel, or the 20% restocking fee. Mrs. Sontal Jackson-Ferrell responded, “Unfortunately Home Depot does not compensate for time, fuel, or frustration. However, I am willing to offer $200 for your cancelled order. Do you accept?” After I accepted because I was over the situation, Mrs. Sontal Jackson-Ferrell asked me to take a survey on how well she preformed and asked me to rate her a “5” as she did the best she possibly could do and anything less then a “5” is a failure.Take your business to anywhere besides Home Depot, if you do go there and get screwed over, make sure you contact Mrs. Sontal Jackson-Ferrell and keep plugging away at those gift cards. Who knows how much she is willing to go to keep you quiet?",0,1

So $ 1,800 dollars and two uses later the wheels feel off the machine. That is when I called Home Depot and was shuffled of to MTD. MTD so far has been dead in the water. I had the unitrepair locally because of the transportation issues in the isolated area where we live. My repair guy picked up the unit fixed it and returned it later the same day. Cost me $255.00 but the loss of use issue with a steep driveway in the dead of winter made my choice the right way to go. MTD wanted me to use their authorized guy who was 85 miles away over the Wasatch Mountains. Since paying for the repair out of pocket MTD has not gotten back to me on reimbursement. My mechanic said there was too much play in the axle when manufactured. Oh well live and learn. BOTH MTD AND HOME DEPOT are on my DO NOT DISTURB list for futurepurchases",0,1
The Home Depot,Heads up to anyone ordering appliances,"Heads up to anyone ordering appliances off of HomeDepot.com... DON’T! I waited over a month for our new washer and dryer set to be delivered. It got delivered to us on a Tuesday so I had to take the day off of work to sit for a 6 hour delivery window. I did not want to pay extra for the install of plugging it in, (which now tops the list of things I regret) so I had them leave the washer and dryer in the garage. Fast forward to Saturday (the first available day my husband had to hook them up because he has a job) we discovered that the door latch on the front load dryer was broken off inside the door. Funny, but not so funny thing is, the door was taped shut as if someone knew the door was broken but decided to ship it to us anyway. We called customer service that same Saturday afternoon and after being mysteriously disconnected 3 different times the 4th person told us that there is a strict 48 hour window from the time it’s delivered to report any damages and that they would not be willing to replace it. They then transferred us to the service department to schedule a repair man to come and fix the dryer, to which I explained that it was a broken door latch and that nothing else seemed to be wrong with the dryer and further requested they make a note under my scheduled appointment of the reported damages so that the repair man wouldn’t waste his time or mine “fixing” our never used dryer with a broken door latch. But guess who showed up today without the part necessary to repair my dryer? Yep that would be Mr. Repair Man. And guess who has to wait another week for the part to be shipped. That would be me. And guess who still doesn’t have a working dryer after 3 months. Yep, me again. Save your money, time, and sanity. DO NOT SHOP HOME DEPOT!!!! Worst customer service ever.",0,1

The two men took their sweet time unloading it from the truck. I chose to wait patiently inside while they did this. About 5 minutes past and I looked out my front door to see the were wrestling in the street. Not unpacking the fridge. Wrestling. I gave them a questioning look that caused them to get back to work. When they were finally in the house, the guy controlling the movement of the fridge almost ran it into our wall and into our light fixture. As they were finishing up, I asked them if they had our hose for the fridge that we had ordered. One guy said yes that he would grab it, while the other had me sign the receipt. Once I signed everything, I once again asked about the hose. They almost forgot to give me the hose even though I had just asked asked about it. The guy grabbing the hose chucked it across our yard and it proceeded to land on our entry walk. These men who were hired by Home Depot were extremely unprofessional. ONLY POSITIVE NOTE. No damage to fridge. But, terrible customer service.",0,1

So, when I see the guarantee that Home Depot posted on the Ridgid cordless tools I figured I couldn't go wrong-WRONG. I did as they said, registered my tool purchases the same day I purchased them. The first tool of the 15 tools I had purchased over a 6-month period burned out in 9 months. So, I tried to find out how to get a replacement, Ridgid help line said take it to Home Depot, Home Depot said to contact Ridgid. this week it has been over three years with the same thing. My total purchases of Ridgid tools is $3,000.00+.

The Home Depot,GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS......I…,"GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS......I should have read these reviews before i bought appliances around 4k from home depot. They were not in stock. Once bought they just dont care and all you can do is cancel or live with it. But if you cancel you probably already invested months into the process. They take no responsibility or accountability and blame all subcontractors and vendors and hang up on you or make up excuses. All the excuses they use and maybe you can mitigate if in the same situation.....first dont use them but if you do ....remember ..... the delivery people are in Toronto and dont care....always the vendors problem ie samsung or general electrics fault or the delivery companies fault or we had the wrong address or google maps sent us to the wrong location or we called you once but didnt leave a message or call back number...and most importantly their word means nothing so in other words they will deliver anytime in the next year and you need to be at your home between 8 and 12 or 12 and 5 on any day they tell you and if they make a mistake it is not their fault and they will deliver when it is convenient to them. So if you make a mistake and buy from these guys go by some lube and hand it to the home depot rep ask them to give you some flowers and stand up drop your pants put your elbows on the table and take it. And none of these poor ratings will ever stop this company or make their employees give a dam. It has to be a culture of no accountability there like so many large corporations. And it will never change until we stop buying from them. It is unfortunate because i like the local store but if they do not have it in stock buy straight from the supplier dont worry about the money, you will save it in the end.....pun intended.",0,1

Tried to reply and its an unmonitored email address. Here is the email I tried send hopefully someone there see's it and they fix this for future customers This is unfortunate. I feel differently about this situation and how Home Depot could have helped. I spent my hard earned money with Home Depot, not GE. I would have expected after the initial call in January that there was a problem with the product your company sold me (again, not GE) that I would get a follow up call to make sure I was satisfied as a customer. Those calls never happened, and now 2 months later, multiple additional phone calls and sitting on hold for over 6 hours of my personal time I still have no resolution, and worse off I still do not have a working oven for a family of 6. We have spent an unknown amount of money on take out food, or other food items because we cannot properly cook in our home. Home Depot should be standing by their customers, and they should be standing up for the product they sell, not pushing the blame to them when a problem arises. My wife and I are beyond upset over this situation, as again it has impacted our house, and the comfort we get from making dinners, deserts, etc in our home.

Then, on the day the dishwasher was supposed to be redelivered, no one showed up. So we called Home Depot again and they said our order was cancelled per the original delivery men.

I called the Brickyard store where I purchased the dryer, again I was transferred, this time to the Home Depot Hot Line. I was told to call my gas company. I guess once HD gets your money, you’re on your own if you have a problem! I will never spend another penny in their stores",0,1
The Home Depot,STAY AWAY from Home depot (Scam Depot),"We ordered a gas range on 02/06/2021 that was to be delivered on 02/18/2021 and they came to deliver it but due to the pending inspection they said that we should reschedule the delivery for another day which then came out to be 02/25/2021 and the guys left with the range. On 02/25/2021 the guys came without the range just for installation, I guess because in their system it was marked as delivered by the guys who came previously, so we were again told that they will deliver it on 02/27/2021 between 10:30am to 2:30pm.Now on 02/27/2021 since no one showed up by 2:15 pm, I called in the appliance delivery department and they said that the truck is on the way, so while waiting for the truck I saw the same enterprise truck that they came in earlier twice was taking a U turn in front my house and to my surprise they did not stop and drove away. I just moved to my new place couple of weeks ago so do not have security camera installed but can get it from my neighbors to show that the guys did not stop at all. So right after that I called back in the delivery department at 2:30pm to check where they are and the agent said that in the system it was showing as delivered and installed....What???? Even if this has to be true can they do everything (park the truck, unload, place it in the kitchen and install with all safety) in 15 mins? Wow...what a scam!!!Now another call to an agent and explained everything what happened and they said that the range is missing and they have placed a search order to locate it in their warehouse. So then what was that thing when the previous agent told me that it was delivered and installed!!! Now I cannot even cancel my order to get my $3300 until they find my missing range. Please stay away from Home Depot and buy from manufacturer's website or Lowe's maybe.",0,1

Ask and associate in the lumber department if he could make some cuts I was informed that their store policy is that they only make six cuts I need a 24 cuts. I said I’d love to talk to a manager another gentleman walked down asked me how my day was going I explain to him how miserable I was he informed me we only do six cuts I took a picture of the sign at the wood cutting station says the first to cut a free $.50 there after each cut I made 24 cuts all by hand and wasted at least a half hour of my time. Spoke to one of the associates outside about my dilemma that I experienced in the store the gentleman is very helpful his first name is Ron we’ve been in there quite a bit we are in all the time buying doors windows siding trim flooring not just my house but my sons house also. Ron and I had a lengthy talk about if you stacked up so many pieces you can cut four or five boards in one shot to stay within the six cut parameter but the other employees did not even want to think about how to appease a customer to go and spend $500 on trim.Or just their shy of $455 my receipt number ending in 8096 and I was in there at 8:40 on 2-20-21The cashier was helpful we added up the linear feet it was a pleasant experience to check out that fast it was easier to check out then it was to get the amount of lumber I needed. I don’t usually write and complain about my experience in a store I just usually stop shopping there and some of the employees in the Plymouth branch are very helpful they go out of your way to get you what you need to get you in and out of the store usually makes me wanna spend a little more money but then when I get employees that don’t even want to try to help out someone it makes me 10 not to want to spend money.

Gave up on that. Brought it to the store ... No we can't take it here, the vendor has to pick it up. Store manager helped with that. OK, that's something. Vendor did shockingly pick it up ... but 9 days later.OK, now what. Was told the refund would process after it was ""scanned"" back at the warehouse. Waited a week, nothing happened. Called to inquire. Within 2 hours, received an email confirming my refund. Called to see when the refund was made. Oh ... today. So on the day that I called to inquire about my refund, that was the day the refund was executed. Quite a coincidence. Do you think the story is over? Hasn't hit my credit card yet.

I asked what all it entailed and she said all she needed was my name and home phone. Last night I got a call saying that I had been drawn as a winner and all I had to do to receive the gift card is let their rep sample my water and allow their rep to film how surprised I would be at the results. I agreed to let them show up at the house. When they arrived I ask him for the gift card and was told I had to have my water tested to get it and that I had agreed to that. I told him I told them it was ok for him to come out and they had talked about water testing not me. I explained that failure to omit that I wasn't going to allow my water tested was about the same as them failing to admit that water test was required to win gift card. Look up the company that Home depot is allowing to prey upon their customers and every other hit is about scam company.,0,1

The Home Depot,This complaint involves the purchase of a freezer and washer pedestal,"This complaint involves the purchase of two items from Home Depot. One is a pedestal that goes under a Samsung washing machine. The other is a freezer made by GE. We noticed about three days after purchasing a freezer that we had installed in our basement that the freezer was not cooling properly. Even though the freezer was placed there a mere 72 hours ago, Home Depot completely disavows any responsibility for it. Your freezer could explode into a ball of fire after 72 hours and Home Depot will do absolutely nothing. Separately, the Home Depot site will allow you to purchase a pedestal for a Samsung washer without simultaneously buying the washer. The site will even encourage you to pay for installation of the pedestal (which I did). Not until the pedestal is delivered to the consumer’s home is the consumer informed that you can’t attach a pedestal to a pre-existing washing machine. Home Depot charges you to install something that cannot physically be installed! The burden of returning the pedestal to the nearest Home Depot store is then shifted to the consumer (you can lift a 70-pound box, can’t you?), and the consumer is then forced to argue with the retail store incessantly to get them to accept the return for a screw up that Home Depot’s own web site created.

The customer service process included many calls with the escalated customer service line and more than a few snarky customer service agents, including being told I would be called back in 24 hours, then when I followed up 3 days later, I was told in a very patronizing tone that I needed to have some patience. We took the delivery but we will not be giving them about 40-50k of flooring, countertops, and cabinet work we were planning. I will never step foot in a home depot again.

The Home Depot,Don't get Delivery/Installation,"Purchased 6 appliances and had to wait 4 months for delivery of all items. The people that delivered the appliances are a 3rd party company and not affiliated with home depot. They pulled up with a rental truck from enterprise. Once the team started to uninstall the appliances there were automatic appliance issues due to water shut off valves not being right next to where the units are located and washer valves. The driver told me that he would put in work order for a plumber to come out and fix everything and since it was considered an emergency the plumber would call me with 48 hours. Fridge and dishwasher left in my garage. This was on a Saturday, so I told the guy when they would be back and he said once the plumber finished they could probably be back out on Monday Tuesday. Monday came around and no one had called. I called and text the delivery guy and never received a call back. Tuesday came and I called the delivery guy again and had to lvm for him again. He called back very unprofessional and rude. He told me he said 48 hours and that no one works on Sundays and that I had to wait, he told me he had never said anything to me about Monday or Tuesday and told me he would never say something like that. He then told me he had to go, he had another customer. I was very upset as to being treated so rudely and I am your customer, when did I stop being your customer?? I called home depot and got the delivery team rep. Let her know my issues with appliances, timeframe, delivery driver etc. She gave me the number of the plumber (yet another 3rd party company). I decided to wait till the end of day Tuesday to see if the plumber would call and nothing. I called the plumber and the guy told me that it was a lot of work to do this and he could not come out till Friday 2/12 between 2-5. Plumber also told me the delivery guy had only subd one item to fix, they did not know there was 3. Called back Home Depot and was told they only use this one plumber but if I wanted to I could get the plumbing done with another company but they would not pay for it. I was told that since the plumber was coming out on Friday 2/12 the delivery team would come back out Monday 2/15 to complete installation of the appliances. Friday 2/12 plumber arrives at 3:30pm. He could not complete the work on the refrigerator because he did not have pipes in his truck, not sure how you dont have copper pipes in your truck if you are a plumber. Plumber had said he had been getting home everyday after 7pm and it was Friday so I would have to reschedule to get the water valve put in etc. Delivery team was to be back today 2/15 to install all appliances. My window of this was between 10-2. I get a call at 11 that my delivery/installation was canceled due to extreme weather conditions. I called the number back to get a rep, I was told due to extreme weather conditions they could not make the appointment. I asked what weather conditions, it had been cold but that is all. I could not get an answer and was told they could reschedule me on Weds 2/17 for installation. The call dropped and could not get anyone back on the phone. I called home depot back and was told their systems went down. I got another call from the delivery company saying all appointments were on a one day delay, so everything would be delivered on 2/16. Home depot rep called me and stated that she was not sure what was going on with the delivery company and gave me their number. She said that the delivery companies trucks froze and no deliveries were getting done today and possibly could be done on Wednesday 2/17. I decided to call the delivery company directly. I was told to ignore the call that I got about the 1 day delay, it was incorrect and also to ignore the call I would get later this evening because they are not sure when they can get out to me. He told me he has me scheduled for Wednesday but to take that with a grain of salt because now they have to make up for one day out of service. He said they have to take care of the customers for Tuesday deliveries first before they can do the ones for Monday. He said they dont have enough staff to fulfil the orders and people will have to be squeezed in. So this continues! So with all of this never order anything that has to be delivered/ Installed from Home Depot, if you can not take the products home yourself consider it to be a never ending revolving door. Had to wait so long to get these appliances then have to go thru all of this mess. This is a lesson learned for me and I will never purchase anything from home depot again. I have always gone to Lowes and not sure why I decided to go to home depot, this wont happen again.",0,1
The Home Depot,Ordered product online,Ordered product online. Gladiator heavy duty shelves. Came on time. Opened product cardboard shipping box. Product had obviously been dropped hard in handling as there was HUGE dent in the top shelves. Each shelf could supposedly support 1000 lbs. Oh well. Looks like China is going to win this one as I will be ordering the same product from Amazon from now on. Makes me SICK for taking a chance on a American company. SICK.Edit:Home Depot sent UPS to pick it up at my door and refunded the balance in 4 days.,0,1
The Home Depot,Kindness is Free,"I am rating my recent experience as a 4 only because of employee associate Sean. I accidentally came upon him as I was frustrated and about to leave the Rte 2 Annapolis store and purchase my other items at another store. The hero who saved the day was Sean. I had just stood beside another associate who knew I was there but continued to surf the net. (yes I could see the items). But my purpose here is to point out the exceptionally good, not further tear down what is seemingly problematic for your store. Perhaps they were having a bad day and it’s not intrinsic behavior. When I politely excused myself for interrupting, and asked if they would answer a question I was greeted with a frown, and told “where to go” (felt quite literal) for the help I needed. Those individuals were more customer friendly. But still I was saddened to have an encounter like that in your store. In enters SEAN to the rescue. He was courteous, friendly, and helpful and all with a “genuine” smile. All I needed was direction, but he made sure I got what I needed. I thanked him and he was off probably helping some other customer along the way. I did not know initially that he was a new hire. Please let him know by acknowledging to him that he was recognized by a customer. Let him know that he kept me from going to another store. I am adamant about not paying for poor customer service, I am equally as adamant about giving credit where it is due. Kindness is free.",0,4

The Home Depot,Poor Customer Service,"I purchased, via an online order, a brand new Frigidaire refrigerator from Home Depot using my Home Depot Credit Card on December 2, 2020. The item was finally delivered and set-up on Saturday, December 26, 2020. Due to the holidays, we were not home on Sunday and arrived home late on Monday, December 28th. I first noticed water on our wood floors around the refrigerator, and found ice forming along the outside seal between the door and the refrigerator wall. I opened the freezer door and the entire inside of the freezer and ice maker was covered in a thick frost coating of ice. I immediately unplugged the unit and opened both doors and placed towels around the freezer area to prevent the melting ice from further damaging our wooden floors.On Tuesday, December 29, 2020, I drove to our local Home Depot where the purchase was made and told a Customer Service representative about the issue. She told me that I needed to call Frigidaire directly. I called Frigidaire and after a 1 hour and 10 minute wait on hold, I relayed to the customer service representative what had occurred. She asked me if the seal looked damaged and I told her no. I told her there was a notable gap between the freezer door seal and the side wall of the refrigerator. She asked if I could slip a “one dollar bill” through that gap and I let her know that I could slip my entire money clip through that gap. She then offered to mail me a new seal, and that I could install it myself. I told her that since it was brand new, I didn’t feel I should have to repair it. She said the problem was common and that they would send out a local appliance repair person to fix it.On Tuesday January 5, 2021, the local service repair person arrived and tried unsuccessfully to replace the seal, then kept working the door to see if he could get the gap to close. This didn’t work and only made the doors on the refrigerator look out of square. He then removed the freezer door and with a straight edge, found that there was a warp in the refrigerator wall cabinet on the freezer side. What this meant is that the seal would never touch that warped area. He even used a hair dryer to melt and expand the seal, but that didn’t work either. He then contacted his service contact at Electrolux and sent them photos of the issue (the gap) and told me that more than likely Frigidaire would replace the refrigerator since this was a factory defect. He told me that if I didn’t hear back from Frigidaire by Friday (January 8, 2021), I should call them.Friday January 8, 2021 came and went with no word back from Frigidaire. Keep in mind that the refrigerator was still sitting unplugged in my kitchen with the doors opened since Monday December 28, 2020. On Monday January 11, 2021, I called Frigidaire customer service and after waiting nearly an hour on hold, I spoke with a representative about the current status of my claim. I was told it was “under review” and that they would let me know soon. After that call, I called a Home Depot customer service representative in order to see if they would help me with the situation. I explained all of the details to the representative and he said he would call Frigidaire and see what was happening while I was on hold on the phone. When he came back on the line, he said there was nothing that Home Depot could do since I had not called them within the 48 hour delivery limit timeline they have. I told him that I drove to their store and reported it and he told me that I was supposed to call so they would have a record of it and that since the 48 hours had expired, it was up to Frigidaire to handle it. I let him know that I had received an email from Frigidaire stating that the issue was under review and that if they decided to “buy back” the unit, they would only refund me the purchase price amount, less any service delivery fee and sales taxes paid. I told him that was unacceptable and that if they planned on refunding me my money, it should be for the full amount. He again, hid behind the 48 hour window. I then told him to have Frigidaire bring me a brand new, same refrigerator, and replace this factory defective one and he came back on the line after speaking with a Frigidaire representative informing me that they no longer had that same unit available, and that for more money I could purchase another refrigerator. I let the Home Depot representative know that I would be contesting the charges since I had made the purchase on my Home Depot credit card. And that I wanted a full refund or another refrigerator delivered. He told me it was out of his hands and that the 48 hour rule was the issue. Keeping in mind that it was 51 hours after Home Depot delivered it when I found the water on our kitchen floor from the defective refrigerator due to being out of town during the holiday.",0,1
The Home Depot,Nightmare,"Nightmare! I ordered a dishwasher in Oct 2020 and the company who delivered it damaged my cabinets. They said they could not install because it was suppose to secure on the top and not on the sides of the dishwasher and I would need to purchase that item. They left the dishwasher in the middle of my kitchen and said they can't install today and reschedule until I get that piece. I called home depot and then had them pick up the dishwasher because I would need to drill into my granite to secure the washer so decided on another model. I ordered again and when it was time to get my new dishwasher I was called the day of the delivery that the dishwasher was damaged and rescheduled for another 2 weeks. I called HD to complain and they reimbursed me the amount of the install due to my complaints. The new delivery date comes and they came to deliver and did not install. i paid for install, takeaway old dishwasher and paid for a tool kit. The guys just left and now another dishwasher sitting in my kitchen. I had called home depot customer service. Somehow the discount I got from the prior issue made it seem as if the installation was cancelled. I was crying!!!! This has been a nightmare and now I need to pay for someone to install. This has been a nightmare for 4 months!! I will never order online from Home depot again.",0,1

The Home Depot,Placed an online order for a tool box…,"Placed an online order for a tool box and selected scheduled delivery as I have several times in the past from HD. A representative from HD Orland Park Illinois called and left a message for me to call him back to confirm the delivery. I called him back (answers the phone ""Hello?"" No indication I reached HD) and he advised me that the delivery would be made tomorrow. However I was told that the delivery driver would call me tomorrow before the delivery was to be made (between 6a and 10p) to again confirm the delivery and if I was unavailable to take the call the delivery may not be made. I tried to explain that I may not be able to answer as I would be at work for part of the day, and that I had received scheduled deliveries and just regular deliveries from HD that were far larger and valuable that did not require a signature and were just left on the front porch. The previous deliveries had never had to be confirmed by phone, and certainly not twice. This order was placed online, clearly requests you press the confirm order button, and clearly stated no signature required, outside delivery with the delivery date. The rep informed me that this was a new policy for this store as of Feb. 3rd put in place by the store manager. I then called the store back to speak with the store manager, Jodi, who, lo and behold answers the phone, ""Hello?"", no indication who I reached and that this was HD I was calling. I had to ask if this was HD that I had reached. I proceeded to explain to him again the the problem and while I was in mid-sentence he began to talk over me repeatedly not allowing me to finish. I was stunned at his rudeness and unprofessionalism. He was actually mumbling and rambling, and from what words I could actually understand his explanation made no sense. He actually even called our conversation stupid.Even for HD, this is an appalling case of lousy customer service, by the store manager, no less.",0,1
The Home Depot,Despite some recent disappointments…,"Despite some recent disappointments with HD, when my refrigerator went out, I gave them a chance to redeem themselves one more time.It was a huge mistake. Not only did they have many fewer models on display in the store than online, with vastly different prices and feature, the clerk was unknowledgeable. Regardless, having done my homework I could select an adequate third-best (the food was spoiling as I talked).I made my choice only to find that it would be almost 10 days before I could expect to see any relief. I girded my loins and threw out about half the food, ate what did not spoil and schlepped 40# of ice a day to the defunct machine to keep this cool.Finally, the great day arrived and on time I got a garbled announcement of the Refrigerator's imminent arrival.A guy in dreadlocks to the small of his back and an attitude, came in and peeked behind the frig without bothering to even get a light, pronounced that it did not have a cutoff (which is is the contract although had he actually looked he would have found it) and thus could do nothing. I pointed the cut off to him and his next dodge (not in the contract) was that the lining was copper. I told him I would accept full responsibility for any leaks. He had no answer other than to claim I was ""yelling at him"" -- in a loud voice, before calling his handler and loudly stating he was going to let me cool down before proceeding. I told him again that I would do the disconnect, but by that time he was heading out the door. In the ten minutes it took to fetch a wrench and disconnect the water line, (with no problem whatever) the guy had left without another word. This guy obviously has a psych problem but the response of HD is more damning.As soon as I could I went to HD (60 min) and waited a prolonged time to get a supervisor. Her immediate response was that the problem lay with the shipping company and had nothing to do with HD, the most basic of ploys.Despite spending well over $2000 on this item, she could not gin up enough enthusiasm to even appear interested in my dilemma,Serious, this is the last time I buy anything from HD other that screws and paint.",0,1

The Home Depot,0 star,"FIRST OFF LET ME START BY SAYING IM POSTING THIS FOR MY BROTHER AND HIS EXPEREINCE BECAUSE I AM SO APPALLED BY WHAT HAPPENED!HERE IS HIS STORY :I Went to home depot on El Toro store#1840 2/8/21 around 655pmHe grabbed a 6ft power strip and then went to aisle 9 to look for some fittings ..The older gentleman helped me with what I was looking for (very helpful) after he helped him, he said at the beginning of this isle is where you will find the rest of what I was looking for a few minutes go by and couldn't find what I was looking for. Val was coming down the aisle as I asked him for assistance. After explain what I was looking for he says we don't have anything that will work for that. I said okay and he walked away. I ignored what he said and kept looking I ended up finding the one of the two pieces I needed to complete my project.After I kept looking, I couldn't find the second piece. I walked over the customer service/ returns and I asked if they could get me someone to help me on aisle 9. I waited for 4-5min and no one arrived I once again walked back to the customer service/returns and the nice lady said ill page them again.After the second page here comes Val again. He seemed frustrated and upset as he approached me the first thing, he does is yell at the lady at the customer service/ return counter and says you don't need to keep paging me just call me on this phone. (very rude tone of voice) After he tells her I let him know I found the one piece I needed and I was looking for the other attachment right away he says, I told you we don't have what you're looking for home depot doesn't have everything. (he is the expert he should be helping me come up with a solution or another option).I just said whatever I dropped everything I was going to buy on the shelf and walked away. As I walked away, I stopped by the customer service/ return counter and asked what the managers name and what the sales reps name was. They told me and asked why, I said I have never meet someone so rude and with such poor customer service in my life. He heard me complaining and walked towards the counter as I was walking out of the store.I got in my car and as I am driving towards the exit driving in front of the store Val was standing right outside the sliding doors and says to me f off. I slammed on my breaks got out of the car and said excuse me what did you say. He said nothing and I responded that's what I thought. I got back in my car and I hear him saying more s***. So, I get back out of my car and I said this is how you talk to your customers. He kept saying s^^t and as he started to walk towards my car, I felt scared for my life he was so upset like he was going to attack me he seemed very angry I was going to complain about him. I got in my car drove off and immediately called the store manager Robert.At this time, I didn't know the sales reps name I kept describing him to Robert, he said we have lots of employees I am not sure who you're talking about but ill try to figure it out. He refused to give me his name. I drove back to the home depot and had a family member go Identify the sales rep that had now at this point turned his name badge around. I saw an employee in the parking lot and I asked him what the guys name was after I described him and mentioned a few names I thought I heard. After the employee says his name is VAL.I called back to speak to Robert the same night to give him the employees name, He was with a customer and couldn't answer the phone, I waited for 20min on hold and nothing. I called back again in 20minutes and he was still with a customer. Let me tell you it was 830 at this time and the home depot was dead when I went at 7. Seems more like he was ignoring my call. Still today I am startled by the situation and can't comprehend what happened.I shop at home depot weekly and I have no Idea how I can go back there to continue my shopping the guy is out to get me.I can't believe he had to go through this , makes me sad because the only thing running in our minds is they did because of our ethnic background and color of his skin.",0,1

At the time a Samsung repairman came out and replaced the heating element. We still had the warranty for Samsung. Since then the dryer has worked fine. However, the washer has caused issues almost a year now. We contacted home depot to repair the washer. The 8C is the error code that always showed on the washer. They sent a repairman out for a diagnostic. Then a couple of weeks later someone came out to fix it. This has happened a few times. We'll call due to the washer not working, they'll send someone out for a diagnostic then a week or so later someone will come and repair. It takes up to three days just wash one load of laundry. In the meantime the water from washer runs because of the malfunction. This has caused our water bill to be as high as 500 dollars. Instead of the replacing the washer they want to send someone out for a diagnostic. A later someone will come and repair. We're sick of the run around. We're a family of five. They claim they understand our frustration and this is a process. How long does the process take? This has been going on for other a year. They can look at the notes in the system and see the error and repair history. We've paid for this appliance and it's been a headache for almost a year now. This is unfair to us as customers.

We bought a Magtag washing machine.It was a defective machine. We had it returned. Was given the wrong number for a refund. The number to call for a full refund is 1-800-430-3376.Customer service called the vender for pickup. We was told to expect a refund in 5 to 10 days. The refund never went through. So they said another 3 to 5 days. Then was told there is a system error. Then told it was pending. Then was told another 3 to 5 days. Etc. etc. Was finally told it was a Help desk IT Issue - meaning computer issue. This has been on going for almost 6 weeks now. Customer service support number isn't trained to handle our problem. Technical support needs to be notified of all delivery returns. To make sure the customer gets their refund within the first 3 days of their return. The manager doesn't seem to be able to help. Customer service on the phone told us to go back to the store of purchase to get our refund back on the card. I said our you sure the technical issue is solved on our account. Was told that our money was available now. Nope! Customer service was suppose to call the store of purchase for me. To have the refund ready for me when I arrived. Instead we waited for almost an hour. Was told to call the 1-800 #.We refused and demanded our refund. We asked for the manager. Finally customer service in person at the store begged for a It tech guy on the phone to help us get our refund. She had to go through more then one tech. Only one tech had the training to help customer service print out the bar code that she needed to refund our credit card. It took 3 to 5 days for Home Depot to return the money to the card. It took a total of 5 days.Our credit card service told us the refund arrived 5 days after it was charged back. The nightmare lasted 6 weeks and a few days. We did get our refund. Never will have anything delivered again. We called our credit card company. We asked for a Credit charge back. To initiate a credit charge back, you can file a claim with your credit card company against a merchant. If your card issuer deems your complaint has merit, it will remove the money you paid from the merchant’s account and put it back in yours. 60 days wait.Warning don't ever have anything delivered from home depot. Buy it in the store and if you have to return it. Then you just take it back to the store. Delivery doesn't work like that.",0,2
The Home Depot,SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT HOME DEPOT!,"SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT HOME DEPOT!Home Depot doesn't care about their customers! They took a Christmas gift and obliterated it:After spending almost $5k they show customer appreciation by missing MULTIPLE delivery appointments, repeatedly lying to me, never following up, dropping the ball repeatedly, trying to pass off a used/damaged toolbox as 'new', and making their customer come pick up their 3 pallet flooring ""DELIVERY"" order themselves (by which we had no other means than to unload one 30lb box at a time!). Why? Because we couldn't wait yet another week not even knowing if it would really show up AGAIN! Oh yeah did i mention the lies? Or that management agreed to a deal with me, after which corporate called me and retracted from it!Most importantly to me, the toolbox i got for my fiance (something he's wanted for a long time) was a Christmas gift! I was so happy to be able to give him this gift this year, the look on his face was unforgettable... But now I just feel bad for it because all it has done is cause us stress and waste our time and money (3 days off work for missed appointments!) The most crushing moment was when he made the decision to pick up the flooring and deal with his gift later.. He called me after they tried passing off a damaged box as New, and he said ""i don't even care about the toolbox anymore, let's just get the floors done"" 💔 every shred of glamour and glory this toolbox had to him was stripped away by this careless company! They dropped the ball over and over and when it came down to it... I got a call from corporate (they sold me a box they didn't even have!) and their way of fixing it (after management and i had an agreement for how to fix it)... they gave me a refund and washed their hands!

The Home Depot,We’re writing a review on Employee Beatriz,"We’re writing a review on a customer service representative who works in returns at the 1651 Airport Pulling Road Home Depot in Naples FlMy names Tammy and was greeted by a young lady Beatriz while first picking up an online toilet I ordered for curbside pick up. Unfortunately we needed sooner than projected pick up time which Beatriz kindly took care of immediately!She’s super sweet , with a wonderful demeanor towards customers which I personally witnessed prior to myself being helped .She goes that extra mile for us customers , whereas from experience others have not or seemed aggravated because of the extra work involved . Or simply had a unwelcoming personality.I wholeheartedly believe this young lady is a true asset being in the customer service returns right as you walk in the Home Depot.And to go even further, last night when actually returning 2 different boxes of floating flooring that didn’t match , there was sweet Beatriz which was great because I had my husband with me to observe for himself, and he was also very impressed..I love reviewing those who make a difference in my life because there’s sadly many who are the complete opposite of her !!We’re extremely satisfied with our experience with Beatriz and are thankful she’s an employee at our go to HomeDepot store .Sincerely,Tammy",0,5
The Home Depot,Interior paint is for interior exterior for exterior,I'm writing this towards the Southfield Michigan store paint department a word of advice do not tell somebody that they can use an interior paint on the exterior of their home.I had a client who went up to get samples and came back with interior telling me that this paint associate told her that it was okay to use it on the outside it wouldn't make a difference it does make a difference That's why there's two different kinds of paint inside and outside paints they're pigmented and chemically different from each other this is an ongoing problem at the store especially with the one female associate that works in the department.Not only does it seem like I'm the target of a personality attitude or she's just relatively having a bad day bad time bad whatever I don't care I'm a customer do not mislead other people if you don't know what you're doing just because you're in the paint department you need to get out of it bottom line done with this kind of crap,0,1

The Home Depot,Awful appliance delivery service,"My wife and I have been renovating a house over the last year and have spent tens of thousands of dollars at Home Depot (regrettably as it’s the only large home improvement store close by). We recently purchased a dishwasher and paid for the take away of our old one, as well as delivery and installation. Driver came into the house, took one look at the disconnected old dishwasher, and told us it wasn’t their problem. Left the new dishwasher in our garage in a box and left. We paid for the takeaway and installation and received neither service. This was one of the more recent frustrating experiences with this them but the stores provide awful customer service, and we had a similar experience (although not as bad) when we purchase a refrigerator there last summer. Just spend your money literally anywhere else.",0,1

I called their customer service three times, and all said that it was ""on its way""... the final call, though, they said that the cabinet had been damaged in transit and couldn't be delivered. They refunded my money, but wasted weeks of my time. Look, I'm understanding that things go wrong in shipping etc... but the fact that they were basically like ""yep, sorry..."" with no proactive solution is just absurd. What if I hadn't called? Would I have been refunded in a timely fashion? Given what I experienced, clearly not. I will never, ever shop with them again. That's a promise.",0,1

Lowes took my DD 214 info and I was put into there system after they verified my military Service information. I was told by the cashier that people lie to get the discount. Well, that was total nonsense also. My info has been verified by the State of Texas and my Veteran status is on my license.

When all registers are busy he will take you to another register and genuinely treat you as a friendly neighbor and never leave you standing. When he’s working there he keeps a good flow and if you have a question he will find the way to resolve your problem. You can truly tell he loves the store he works at. And its cheerful to see him taking care of his customers he’s got a great attitude and very attentive and professional. I will continue to go to the Hayden store I love that place!,0,5

The Home Depot,Worst delivery experience EVER,"Worst delivery experience EVER! Ordered two pallets of Tile to be delivered to our house. First off the lady Sue, who's in charge of scheduling deliveries, said to be expecting a call on Friday for delivery. She did not give me a timeframe or anything, just that I should be expecting this call and to make sure I answer my phone on Friday. Umm ok who just sits and waits by their phone all day for a damn phone call??? Anyway, so Thurs night we prepared and cleared a spot in our garage for the tiles so it'll be protected out of the weather. Friday morning comes and of course I missed his call because my phone was in the other room. 30 mins later I get a VM from Sue saying the delivery guy had been trying to call me and he was at my house but because I didn't answer my phone he just left the pallets in my driveway. I did not hear the doorbell ring or anything! So I guess if you miss a call you're out of luck! Now we have to carry in all of these heavy ass tile ourselves, AND there's a big snow storm rolling in as we speak. Ridiculous!! Since when do you spend $1000's only to be treated like you're making an appt with the cable guy to get your damn stuff delivered?! Actually the cable guy is probably more considerate than delivery with HD because they'll at least give you a window of time on when you can expect them!! I was given nothing. I will never order from HD again. Oh not to mention the damn HD kitchen designer took 7+hours between 2 days with us sitting at his desk to come up with a layout for our kitchen! First of all, if it's going to take you longer than expected or if you're new and still learning, wait until you're quicker with your software designing skills before actually meeting with customers and wasting their time! I get that service is free but it sure costs you a pretty penny in a bunch of wasted time. Such a freaking joke!!!",0,1

The Home Depot,"I bought a top of the line $1,400 Rheem…","I bought a top of the line $1,400 Rheem water heater from Home Depot. I opted to pick up the order because it was an additional $100 to deliver and my driveway isn't semi friendly. Home Depot when loading the water heater recommend I stand up the water heater and not lay it down. So I had a ratchet strap I threw over the top and winched it down tight until it was digging into the cardboard box and was sturdy. The box was green banded around the tops and sides, so I was under the assumption I was ratcheting down something solid. What I didn't know was that there was only 2 - 6 inch wide pieces of Styrofoam on the sides to keep the water heater centered. So what happened was, the top was not solid being just cardboard and ripped out going down the road and my water heater fell over my tailgate and out the back of my truck and toppled end over end down the road. The strap was still connected! Home Depot said they weren't liable after it left the store, I called Rheem, got transferred 4 times and finally was told, this is like when you get your groceries home and the bottom of the bag rips out, it's not the stores fault and the manufacturer didn't sell you a faulty product.... So I guess Rheem skimping out on their packaging to cut cost, which benefits Home Depot's bottom line, screws the consumer in the end. Enjoy my money, because that was everything I had and I still don't have a water heater because I don't have the money.Update: I posted this exact same thing on Home Depot twice and 2 times now it has said it will post after 48 hours.

The Home Depot,"Home Depot, the Anti DIY store","Reston, VA. Thought I'd share the reason that Home Depot (HD) has such poor ratings in general and more so, recently. Looking at shareholder value, they are doing very well. However, looking at the customer experience (CX), they are terrible and it comes from the top. The products are, for the most part, good (when they are in stock). However, if you want CX, go to Lowe's! Two examples I'll share are: 1) As a DIYer that has been doing major projects over the past 5 years (>$100,000 spent - mostly with Lowe's), HD doesn't offer a volume discount. Recently, I had HD and Lowe's compete for $5,500 of materials for a screened in porch. HD offered 0% and Lowe's offered 14% (and no, it's not because Lowe's was more expensive). 2) HD now charges a 9% restocking fee (listed per item on a receipt from a $300 purchase on 1/23/21). As HD is right around the corner, it's tough to drive further for smaller buys, but HD is ""driving"" me to a different conclusion.",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot's policy on veteran…,Home Depot's policy on veteran discounts is conflicting. The discount is only available to those veterans that present a disability rating. The discount does not apply to those veterans that have no disability rating. There metrics on rewarding the discount is bias and without merit. The Dept. Veteran Affairs recognizes all veterans regardless of there disability ratings for specific benefits and entitlements. My take away of this practice is that Home Depot does not acknowledge equality or equity among the veteran culture. Worse case scenario maybe there discount is only given to specific ethnicities.

They refused to issue a refund and told me that I had to resolve the matter through PayPal. I was honestly shocked at the complete lack of accountability at this company. Update: Filing a claim with PayPal was completely useless. After three weeks they simply accepted HomeDepot's claims that the package was delivered. I finally gave up on trying to resolve this peaceably and filed a claim against HomeDepot with BBB. That had an immediate effect. Someone called me from HD headquarters several hours later and grudgingly issued a refund. I am glad to have the money back, but this has been an extremely unpleasant process.

Well that doesn't work because I don't plan on ever shopping with this company again.",0,1

After I said, I would go elsewhere, he found a woman in appliances who called their ""installer."" Their installer quoted me $1,200 just to install the $679 hot water heater I wanted to buy. They need to find new plumbers! This is outrageous. I ended of with a local plumber who supplied a better brand hot water heater and installed it for $1,300. I had the same problem when I wanted to purchase a new washer and dryer--there was not one person who could answer any of my questions. Will not make any major purchases at a Home Depot.",0,1

The Home Depot,I would give them minus 1 if I could,"I would give them minus 1 if I could. It's all about returns. I live 40 miles from the nearest homedepot. This is the 3rd time I have had to either return or wait for a replacement. I tried to cancel my order of a Makita String trimmer the day after I ordered it. Even called customer support. But she could't stop it. So it arrived monday, and I called right away to get it picked up. It came UPS and now they are telling me it has to go back via NonStop Delivery which would call me by tuesday and be here Wed. Guess what, No call on Tuesday. I called this morning Wed to see where they were and ask why UPS can't pick it up since they delivered it. The nice lady did a return and sent me an email saying it would be picked up by UPS, even after the first lady said it couldn't be. So at 3 pm today I get an email telling me it has to be picked up by NonStop Delivery because of the UPS restrictions. There is nothing in the restrictions that I have been able to find that says it can't be picked up. So now I am on hold again with HomeDepot. ""( Mean time they have my $475 and won't refund until they have it back. This is going to be a month again before I get my money back. I am so over HDs return system. This is just insane.

Delivery was cancelled and pushed back over a month. The day of our next delivery we removed our old washer/dryer and put outside for them to make it easy and they never showed up on their delivery date and Home Depot couldn’t tell us where our washer/dryer was and couldn’t get a hold of the delivery company. This was Saturday 1/16 and it is now Wednesday 1/20 and we still don’t have a washer/dryer. Was supposed to be delivered today (1/20) and it was cancelled again and rescheduled till Friday. Home Depot managers have been unhelpful to us and have not been accommodating whatsoever. We will never buy appliances from them again. This is not what customer service should look like and is a disappointment to say the least. I would never recommend anyone buy appliances from them.,0,1

Their poor excuses and reasons for not being able to complete the job were completely insane. The level of unprofessionalism was beyond anything that I've ever experienced before. `NOW, I have to pay actual professionals to do the job right!

The Home Depot,Cabinet Chaos,"I went to the Home Depot on Crescent St. in Brockton to order kitchen cabinets. Working with their specialist for 3 hrs. we finally placed the order. I got an email saying there was a problem with my card and to contact my bank. So my order was cancelled. I only had to authorize a transaction for more than $2,000. But then I got an email saying that my partial order was ready for pick up. I went back there to straighten things out. I was then told I didn't qualify for the 10% discount because that was only if you purchased 10 or more cabinets. My original order was for 12. Now 2 of the cabinets are not in stock and am told I can't order them until they're in stock again. All the cabinets are to be held at the store until they're all there. Then I'll get them all delivered at once. I don't have the space to store them and I have to coordinate my carpenter with the delivery. I keep getting emails saying my partial order is ready and even got a final pick up notice. I have no idea when or if the other 2 cabinets will even be available. When they cancelled the original order why did they do that but then go ahead with a partial order? This entire process has got me so upset. I have to set up a dumpster, a plumber, an electrician and carpenter. Not knowing the situation with the cabinets has messed me up big time. I now have little faith in a company I have admired for years.",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot hates the customer,"Home Depot customer service has always been bad, but recently seems to almost be aggressively bad. They hate customers, and really hate for you to order online and pickup in-store. Don't even think about asking for curbside pickup. While picking up in-store I listen to what they have to say about those people. Do they not realize that without us buying from them they will not have jobs? I don't want Amazon to have a monopoly on everything, but that's where we're headed, because Home Depot doesn't care. Ordered deck paint online, it came in but I couldn't get there before they were going to send it back. Called the store, they said, ""Tough."" Called the 800 number, they called the store and negotiated one extra day. Told me if I didn't pick it up on the 8th day they were shipping it back. Made a special trip, 2 1/2 hours each way. Got there to pick it, they only had 1/2 of the order. However, I had to sign for receipt before I could see the order, so they have a receipt saying I received all of it. They don't know where it is, but my credit card was charged for all of it. One more thing I'll never buy from Home Depot again. The sad thing is, they DON'T care and our only recourse is to write these bad reviews. I write these reviews in hopes that they'll change, but it may be they just go out of business. They are not too big to fail.",0,1

The Home Depot,"Safety to order virtually, but come in for refund?","We ordered an appliance for delivery online. The day after the order, the appliance was listed on the site for $200 less. Home Depot's in-store appliance customer service department, via phone call, told us that there was no mechanism in place to refund the difference without canceling the original order and re-ordering the item, even though that would push out our delivery by another week. We called the online customer service number for appliances, who was very quick and helpful in refunding us the difference, as well as maintaining our original delivery date.A day or two later, our current refrigerator started to work again, so we decided to cancel the order. Allegedly, because we had already made a change to our order (i.e., refund for the sale price), we were told that the item could not be refunded online or via phone.Despite COVID-19 and avoiding in-person purchases for all other products in our lives, Home Depot insisted we had to go to a store for the refund. After a long and unnecessarily complicated discussion with an online customer service representative, and discussion with a manager, customer service offered to hold a conference call with the store to complete the refund virtually. Except she bailed and left me to hear a repeat from the store clerk that someone needed to come into the store to process the refund.We can order online but can't return online.

It took Home Depot a month to send out a service tech. The first tech is not able to fix the dryer. Three more months go by, and a total of four technicians come in and out of my home in the middle of the pandemic, before it is discovered the dryer had been dropped and is unrepairable! The next two months, in this five months of hell, I spent on the phone fighting with Samsung and Home Depot trying to get the dryer replaced. Finally today, after FIVE MONTHS of tears, begging, and fighting for someone to help, the new dryer arrives... and the team refuses to install it because the washing machine they installed is in the way.

The Home Depot,Washer and Dryer Fail,"After having the same washer and dryer for 20+ years I decided to go to my local Home Depot to get a new front loading washer and dryer. I fell in love with a LG set. When purchasing the washer and dryer we decided to open up a Home Depot card to build my husband's credit. We put 1/2 on the card and 1/2 on my debit card. This was on 11/28/20. The sales person who helped us said we couldn't get the washer and dryer until 1/9/21. Though it was over a month away we decided that would be find because we were going to custom build a pedestal for this purchase and I would need a bit to complete that project. We were told that we would get a phone call the day before to give us our delivery window. We never received a call on 1/8/21. I had to call to see what is going on with the delivery. I found out the washer and dryer delivery was now pushed out to 2/17/21! We received no phone call, no heads up. My washer has since quit working so now I do not have a washer. I went to the store to see what we can do or if they have a comparable set I can get sooner. The sales person said we may be able to get the washer and dryer set in white sooner, but couldn't guarantee this either. The sales person who was helping started talking about their MLK sale deals. I found another set, the date we could get this one was 2/5/21 and that was not a guaranteed date. We decided to get a refund and try somewhere else, however the refund is where it gets super fun. This is where everything gets super fantastic. We had already paid off the Home Depot card and they froze the account because it isn't normal for people to make a big purchase and pay it off so quickly. I spoke with a manger and he said he would get me a cash refund due to all the issues we had. I was like great this is fantastic. The manager left and 10 minutes later came back and said he cannot give me the cash refund he said he would. It would all have to happen the way we purchased it. The manager also made a comment he would like to see the corporation just do away with appliance sells because his life would be easier if they didn't have to worry about them. This was not professional. My husband was on the phone forever with the Home Depot card to get it unfrozen to accept the refund. Once he got through they said we have to call back in 2 days to see if the refund went through, but the account will be frozen until the refund pushes through. Once the refund is complete it will be 7-10 business days for us to get a check for the refund. They cannot electronically push the refund back to the bank that paid off the card. The communication is lacking. While we were trying to work out options with the store the lady in the front let us know that there has been so many issues with appliances and people have been waiting 4+ months for their appliances to come into stock. Had we known this we would have shopped elsewhere or went with another manufacturer. The lady also said that the delivery/warehouse personnel are a 3rd party provider and they are hit and miss with the communication to the customers and there is nothing they can do about it. I would love to know why they are even selling items they know will not be in stock for 4+ months. Why they are doing business with 3rd party vendors that are known for lack of communicating with their customers? All of this reflects badly on them. They did nothing to make this purchase right. I am out a washer and dryer, I have to wait a week to 2 weeks for a refund. All of this could have been okay had honest communication taken place. Once we get the refund we will be canceling the credit card. My husband is a contractor who has many times gone to Home Depot multiple times a day to assist his customers. Because there was nothing done to make this right he will be using Lowe's now for this daily construction needs. My suggestions for the store to improve: 1. Be honest with the customers. Let them know that the manufactures are being delayed and the purchases can take months to arrive. 2. Do not have sales for items you do not have available to customers. Most of you customers will need the appliances soon otherwise they would not be shopping for appliances. 3. Do not offer a solution you cannot follow through with. 4. Don't blame all the issues on other companies. The people you do business with will reflect positively or negatively on you. If you continue to get complaints do business with another company that can keep YOUR promises.",0,1
The Home Depot,Unreasonable and unhelpful,"Used my billing address for delivery vs home addressand asked to correct the address. I have waited a month for my order. I called to change my street address in the same town and they would not change it. Wanted me to cancel order and reorder putting delivery out 2 more months ! Completely unreasonable and unhelpful! Now my product is being delivered to the wrong address and i have to hire someone to transfer to correct address 2 miles down the road. Ridiculous I will never order home delivery again.

The Home Depot,"I am a long time customer of HD - but very, very Unhappy","I am a long time customer of HD - and have even been a shareholder. I placed an order in November 2020 for an appliance on sale. Since I placed the order, my builder changed the warehouse (delivery) address. I have spent 4 days trying to get 2 lines of data changed to update the address to the new location - 1 mile away. I have offered every type of identification they may need, but they will not change the address. They are currently shipping items for me to the new address - one would think they could make a connection between the orders going to the new location for the same customer?? They say I can cancel and re-order, but I will lose the sale price, which was a great incentive to buy from HD. All of the CSRs have been as nice as can be, but they have their hands tied by a rigid, non-empowering management and policy structure - so they can do nothing. HD wants feedback and asks that you contact Call Customer Care on 1-800-HOME-DEPOT - totally useless! Same run around, time after time -nothing changes or helps. Bottom line - this will turn out ugly with the delivery service trying to deliver to the old address on the order. Its a real shame that a company like HD cannot serve the customer with the same level of service that their ""customer service "" messaging.Unhappy & Very disappointed in GA!",0,1

When i called customer service I was told they would not collect or refund, due to this being ""buyers remorse"".... I literally couldn't believe it, in the end I asked to go through to Management, explained I was following the steps I was advised would be the best option, she then said she will see what can be done but can't guarantee and will take 2 days for her to get back to me?!?! Buyers remorse - how? What about my consumer rights and purely the fact I was following the steps provided by Home Depot staff!! I called again this morning, once again spoke to a rude customer service member of staff, who said ""well why didn't the delivery drivers take the machines"" - really? This is not my problem that there seems to be a major issue of communication and procedures. I ended up being put on hold for a long time and then was cut off. So I am no closer to getting this situation resolved, and have uninstalled two machines and a detached door. I am another level angry.",0,1
The Home Depot,This is going to be a long rant...Back…,"This is going to be a long rant...Back on November 6th 2020. We bought a $800 Samsung electric stove from home depot. It couldn't be delivered until december 30th because of the pandemic. Ok whatever!! We waited till then and on the day of delivery they called and said they couldn't deliver because the truck supposedly broke down. And couldn't deliver till January 6th (What you only have 1 truck for deliveries?) Its now been 2 months since we bought it. It finally came on that day and the driver said ""Oh by the way it doesn't come with a power cord,it'll cost $50 for a cord , we can use the cord from the old stove but that'll void the 5 year warranty on the new one."" What kind of stove doesn't come with a power cord? And why weren't we told about this from the sales person? What ever just charge my card.. by now I'm already fuming. Then they discovered a huge dent on the side of the oven. I'm beyond gone at this point. I told them I didn't want it damaged I want a replacement or my money back. My wife called the warehouse and they cant deliver a replacement until February 3rd (3 months after we paid for it) no just give me my money back. I decided to look on home depot's website and they have the same model stove on display but with a different sale for $50 more and can be delivered on January 13th. Home depot called and said they can refund my card in 2 - 3 days. I mentioned the advertisement they have on their website and was told they cant sell it because I would need the replacement one from the warehouse. If I wanted the one in store I would have to pay twice. Hell no!!! Just give me my money back. I'm done with home depot and taking my business elsewhere.

They said they would return that Saturday, did not show up.Called Home Depot and spoke to Carly a supervisor, explained the situation…she arranged another delivery date.Truck showed up today, once again completely unprepared to unload the frig, much less set it up properly.They had no equipment and and indicated they did not know how to properly install the frig.We have had no frig for 2 months and were eagerly awaiting this install…HUGE disappointment Home Depot.Unprofessional! The men who brought the appliance had no clue, they were not employees of Home Depot, but hired out to make deliveries.The frig now sits in our garage as the guys who brought it literally dumped it there in the box. It was supposed to be installed in our kitchen.We have always had great service from Home Depot in our home state Florida, but here in Aiken! No words to describe the lack of attention to service. We thoroughly explained to customer service beforehand that we had an inclined driveway and stairs, no surprises.We now have to hire some else to bring it upstairs and install.Update: We had to hire a moving company to install the frig. Cost...another $250. Install was supposed to be included in Home Depot purchase.Update:The manager of the Local Home Depot on Whisky Rd offered us $200. off on another appliance we purchased to offset our cost. We were surprised and appreciative. Gave a higher rating because of this, however HD should reconsider their delivery company.Susan Applegate, Bob Small4 Burden CircleAiken, SC 29803",0,3

The Home Depot,Worst Customer Service...,"This place has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I placed an ordered on December 27 and the order went through successfully; I even had a tracking number for the packages. However, 5 days later I get an email that the payment authorization failed. I had used two gift cards and a visa for the remainder of the balance. When I called the customer service line that the email told me to call to give the payment so my order could be processed, I had to give to go around to at least 3 different people just for them to tell me they could not do it and call the corporate number the next day (Mon). On Monday, I called the corporate number and talked to a lady (who was very nice) and told me that it was a problem with their system the day that I placed the order and thats why the payment did not go through. She told me that she cancelled the order and for me to go to Home Depot near me to receive my remainder balance of my gift cards at the store. She reassured me that they would know what to do and be able to do it.......I made it up to that Home Depot (which is 40 min away from my house...) just for the associate to tell me there is no way for him to give me the gift card. He told me I would have to contact customer service AGAIN to get them to give me an e-giftcard (why they didn't do that to begin with is confusing to me). The next day, I contact customer service again to have to give the go around again to FINALLY get the electronic gift card. It was such a long ordeal that could have easily been resolved but was handled in an unprofessional manner.****NOW to make matters worse....I just tried to order the item that they cancelled and it is now out of stock.

They tried to scam us out of 45 extra SF. What would we do with the extra? It would be a waste of money. The carpet we picked out was IN STOCK, I saw it on a roll in the store, but they tried to charge us extra for ""special order"". It was quite a crock. So we went to a different store, their measurement was exactly as ours was, and we only paid for 312 SF of carpet, at a cheaper cost.",0,1

The Home Depot,Soul Sucking Install Experience,"Soul Sucking. I have brought a lot of condo association related business to HD over the past 7 years. However, I have been burned more times than not. Kitchen, baths, product delivery or pickup. I had a regional support manager (upon a project repair call) ask me how my store experience was and my only response, was ""great, when I pick the product off the shelf and pay for it at the counter, otherwise, not so good which is why you are here today"". So no, never again, if I can avoid the place. My long term slider door project takes the cake though. Against my better judgement, I was convinced by HD that I could trust using their install services for a large slider door project (for 8 slider doors) purchased in Jan. 2018 and installed 6 months later in July 2018. Yes, six months later. It is now 3 years since that purchase, with rework done in Sept. '18, and Jan '19, followed by another issue in Nov. '19. That issue on Nov. '19 took until Sept. '20 to get someone here. The most recent visit was Nov. '20. On that visit, the installers came, agreed on install issues and parts needed (they brought the wrong ones) and I have never been contacted me again. If HD had shown ANY level of project management (yes, you ProDesk) it would be a miracle. Poor initial contractor installation, repeated rework, lies from the contractors vs. Andersen support, and lastly NO RESPONSE without threatening action on my part. It's the worst contractor experience I have ever seen because I need to manage all stages of product delivery and support. Save your frustration; might cost more but please don't follow my folly. I'm done with them; I'll try to repair the issues on my own now if possible or pay someone else to do HD's job.",0,2

Got a supervisor involved and was told that he could order us a new microwave, but we'd have to wait an additional 10 days. Keep in mind, this microwave is for a tv production kitchen. No microwave = no show (for this particular topic.) For the trouble, the damage, the headache, and the loss of wages (my husband had to take off work) all that Reno Ramirez (supervisor) said he could do was credit us $81.

The Home Depot,They've lost my confidence over $3,"I ordered the wrong paint sheen. A small 8 oz paint sample. Within 1 hour I realized my mistake but I was informed by a representative that the cancellation window is 45 minutes and that there is nothing she can do.I realize this was my own mistake but this is still very poor customer service. Also, the design of the shopping cart and checkout experience likely facilitated this error as the product details are truncated on the checkout screen. I may very well have caught my mistake if that was designed better.Also, a mere 45 minute cancellation window is incredibly unforgiving. Are their systems so antiquated or supply chain so convoluted that they are unable to cancel an order when it's at least a couple of days before it ships? Would I have no recourse should I make a similar mistake on a larger order? I'm afraid of shopping there now.And why no credit for such a small order amount? The 8 oz matte sample that I needed was $2.98 but I mistakenly ordered the satin version for $4.98. I was nothing short of shocked when they did not offer a credit for the $3 matte sample. This isn't a mom and pop store. This is a giant big box retailer that should be more than willing to issue a $3 make-good to keep a customer happy.

Equally established is the fact LESLIE her actions and the three on-duty managers blatant manifestation of racism in downplaying my concern for a prospective major purchase in its' varied and virulent forms was not surprising. Management officials was notified of this individual actions. The masquerading racist managers conspired with her racist treatment and justified her actions after being informed of her unprofessialism. She had an obligation to consult with a front line supervisor before this issue arouse. However, she selectively chose to engage in HOME DEPOT hallmark of 101 Racism treatment of black customers rules.",0,1
The Home Depot,"""Online only"" product never shipped","I ordered an ""online only"" product. It comes from a third-party vendor who cannot be trusted to ship the product. I received a notice that a label was created for shipping, but it was never shipped. Home Depot told me that they cannot control if the product will ever be shipped because it's a third party vendor, and then told me it's being shipped so can't cancel my order. So Home Depot gets into this logic loop where they won't ship the product or cancel your order to refund your money. Buy online at your own risk. Home Depot will not help you and will not work with you to get to the product or your money back.",0,1
The Home Depot,The WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I just heard , accidentally on the news, that there was a recall for Hampton Bay Mara 54”ceiling fans. I bought one in October and I paid for its installation and now I hear ON THE NEWS that it has been recalled because 47 people complained that the blades got detached, causing injuries and damaging properties. If I hadn’t heard the news on TV, I wouldn’t have known and I would have continued to use my ceiling fan putting in danger my life and the life of my family members.. Home Depot had my address and my phone number. I don’t understand why they never called to let me know so that I stop using it. My husband and I have been very loyal customers to Home Depot. When my clients ask me what gift certificate I prefer, I tell them a gift certificate from HD. Now I am not sure I will ever set foot in any of their stores and will instead start shopping on Amazon and Lowe’s. I just called the customer service line. The lady who answered the phone kept me waiting for 30mn and didn’t answer my questions or offered me any help. I was put on hold for 15mn. Is this how HomeDepot reward their loyal customers? Event at the height of the pandemic, we still went to the HD and bought everything there. We are in the middle of doing over our house and most of the materials we get are from HD. But now I doubt that we would ever shop at their stores or buy online from their website.I have the feeling that Home Depot do not care for their customers. This is why people prefer to shop at Amazon. If I had called Amazon, they would have answered me and would have tried to solve the problem. They would try to appease me. HD completely ignored my legitimate complaint. I will NEVER EVER shop there.",0,1
The Home Depot,"Home Depot Tool Rental, old, tired, broken, equipment","My bad experience, again, is about the Home Depot Tool Rental service (department), at the store on the Coors Road Bypass, Coors Road, Albuquerque, NM. This is the third time that I have rented power equipment that was damaged or did not work. The first bad experience was a beat up brick/tile cutter that had a broken on/off switch, and no guard. It was impossible to get a good cut because the guide did not lock in place, (broken) You had to turn the saw on and off by plugging and unplugging. The next time I rented a floor tile machine to scrape up old vinyl floor tiles. The screws that held the blade in place were not the original equipment, and were rigged. To finish the job I had to find bolts that would fit to hold the blade in place. When I was about finished the machine developed a problem with the power switch and I had to finish a 6' by 6' area by hand.Now, December 30th I rented a paint sprayer that I was told was one of the ""newer"" sprayers that they had. It wouldn't prime, and then I only got two passes with the gun before it clogged up. I spent the greater part of my afternoon going up and down, the ladder, flushing water, cleaning the nozzle, and still it would clog up. I was using ceiling paint which they said was no problem. When I returned the machine, they refused to give me a full refund, and then admitted that their older machines have a hard time with ceiling paint. I have come to the conclusion that Home Depot, aside from having the most ""indifferent"" attitude with customer service, rents old, worn, out junk at high prices. I'm going to Lowes....Lets do this!",0,1
The Home Depot,Wish I could leave  a zero star review,"Wish I could leave a zero star review. I ordered a washer and Dryer on Dec 20 on their website with a delivery date of Dec 30. I received an email with the receipt and confirmation with the delivery date and my credit card was charged and I even took the day off of work to accept delivery. On Dec 29 the day prior to delivery I received a call from them stating that my order was only a quote and it needed to be completed. What a quote?? when you purchase something online and receive a receipt, a delivery date and your credit card is charged how is that only a quote? I called the phone # they gave me to figure out what happened and they were not able to help me. When I got home from work I looked at my order history to find out that my order was ""delivered"" I do not know where they delivered it to as I do not have it. I called back Home Depot Customer service and was on the phone with them for 31 minutes 22 seconds and then I was ""disconnected"" I called back and was on the phone with them for 2 hours 4 minutes and 20 seconds trying to figure out what was going on with my order. I talked with 5 different people including a supervisor and had to explain everything to each person, no one knew what was going on and didn't know why I was transferred to them. The first person I spoke with stated that my washer/dryer is scheduled to be delivered on Jan 8. I asked her why the change as I was not informed she did not have an answer she asked me to hold as she was going to transfer me to someone that could help but instead of transferring me to someone else I was sent to their survey. I called back and talked with person #2 and was told that my order was delivered, I explained it was no delivered and it wasn't even supposed to be delivered until the next day. she transferred me to another person. Person #3 stated that I did not have an order and they could not find when. I stated that I have a receipt and I have talked with other people at Home Depot and they were able to find my order, I was asked to hold on while they looked for my order. I was then transferred to Person#4 and was told that my order was cancelled and if I wanted the washer and dryer I needed to reorder. I told them that it was already paid for so why would I want to reorder. I did ask her if I reordered with her if I would have delivery tomorrow as scheduled she said no. I would have to wait until January 10 for delivery. This was odd since as while I was talking with them on the phone I placed the same washer/dryer in my shopping cart and it stated delivery of January 5. Person #4 kept asking for my credit card # I stated that I would not give it to her and asked for a supervisor after waiting on hold a supervisor finally came on the phone she was very useless and told me that I had to reorder the washer/dryer and dispute the original charge with my credit card company. I did buy these on sale and they are no longer on sale and the supervisor would not even honor the price that i originally paid as the items were not on sale anymore and that the original order I placed and paid for was only a quote (yes they were in stock). I ended up placing my order at Lowes and my new washer and dryer will be delivered and installed tomorrow. I would not recommend purchasing anything at Home Depot especially online, if you must purchase from them go in person at least this way you will be able to leave with the items that you purchase and it won't be just a ""quote""",0,1

The Home Depot,Order From Amazon Instead. The Home Depot Customer Service is Absolutely Horrible and they Can't execute on their promises,"I ordered $1,200 worth of stuff on their website. They didn't deliver part of my order and then told me the only way to solve the issue was for me to return everything and try to repurchase. Blamed the miss on an automated warehouse and being busy. I simply asked them to send the missing stuff and apparently that's not something they ""can"" do. In all actuality it's just something they won't do. After hours days and even months trying to resolve the issue The Home Depot was very proud to offer me a 20% discount on the tool once I returned the incomplete one and re-ordered another one. Essentially $60 for all of my time. Basically paid me $3/hr for a giant headache and I still don't have what I ordered. This is not the first experience I've had like this with their on-line ordering system. They seem to be perfectly fine with this terrible service and not at all bothered by the fact that they simply can't execute what they promise. Excuse after excuse but no real resolution.

About a week later we received a list of what was needed to be moved. We followed everything to a tee. The day of carpet installation was a nightmare. We had 4 rooms to get carpeted. 2 guys show up at 2:30pm mind you without masks on and they start speaking to each to each other in a different language. Then they start taking pictures and left and sat in the van. Someone called us and told us that we had excessive furniture in the rooms and the clothes hanging needed to be removed. We did not have excessive furniture at all. Then they told us if we wanted it done we would have to help move furniture. My husband, myself and daughters spent our day moving furniture. Then someone else called to have us help move the furniture back in. They were still working at 8:30pm when another van pulled in with a lady looking for her crew. We had just had our walls painted and they were knicked and scratched badly in places. The next day the carpet people called and asked us to not fill out the survey until they come to a resolution and then offered us a 150 dollar gift card and told us the marks on the walls were already there. Do yourself a favor and don’t get carpeting here. They offer extremely poor customer service and poor on-site service.",0,1

Lots of bumps along the way but incredibly happy with the finished kitchen. Home Depot had made all the arrangements for the difference folks to come in and do the work.Cabinets, Countertop and finally the plumber.1. Gene came in on Nov 20rd to start taking out the old cabinets and putting in the new. Two cabinets measured incorrectly so had to reorder these and the pantry cabinet was damaged, so a sleeve was ordered to correct that. Gene’s work on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 20…If you do go thru home depot for your remolding, ask for Gene. 2. The counter folks came in on Dec 7th to measure for the counter tops and gave us a time to install the counter tops on Dec 22nd. We had no water in the kitchen for Thanksgiving, but we worked around that, and thought we would not have a completed kitchen for Christmas as we still needed the plumber to come in. The staff at Home Depot went above and beyond to have the plumber come on the 22nd so we could have a completed kitchen for Christmas.3. Chris from Home Depot was great working with us, and incredibly pleased with the outcome. Would recommend Home Depot and if any other projects need to be done, we will absolutely return to Home Depot in Dover Delaware.MarkB",0,5

Witch is I did not even received any early delivery notification or call to confirming that they are delivering you’re package today . I asked them if they have any signed documents or delivery receipt to proof their delivery, they referred me to the shipping company, after 2 days of calling and emailing them no answer the phone and no respond to the email, I did contact Home Depot again because I purchased from them and they need to resolve this issue,they told me they run out this item in their inventory and wants me to call my credit company and dispute the charge, witch is it made me loose that offer and I have to repurchase this somewhere else with full amount,also I have to deal with this for 6 weeks long to they investigate that and remove the charge from my card . I can’t purchase another till this thing get clear from my mind.I knew that it was a delivery company mistake but the Home Depot have to use the better carrier or fix this kind of issues for their customer without any hassle, it was a lots of call and detail in between of this story that I did write to make this review short as much as I can .the latest update for me is ,it was a curb side delivery and they can’t contact to let me know they are delivering the items , they can’t even get a hand Write signed because of COVID , they can’t even asked the person name who they delivered the item to them because of some other non sense reason . They only allowed to deliver the people item in any day of the week without notice, no matter how much is the value of the customer item, don’t care who is gonna receive it . Just put it in drive way and run 🏃🏻 After I checked the shipping company rate and review on google I found they have a really bad review from other people and don’t know why the the Home Depot using this service to serve their customers.

The Home Depot,2 failed deliveries,I have never experiences anything like this before a delivery service that does not care at all about the customers. The first delivery was a success but after opening the box I found out that the water heater was damaged. Called home depot and they sent someone to pick up the box but they said it was not taped properly but it was had a argument with the carrier about it and they said they refuse to transport it back for a return. In Turn we had to call top management from home depot to get anything done or have it picked up. It is a big hassle and would never want to deal with this retailer again. Shipment Number two the replacement we stated we needed it taken to the front door since we don't have a dolly so the carrier refused at the time to take it up for us since it said on his paperwork that it was curb side but in theory we requested front door delivery my girlfriend was home at the time and could not possibly do it. All carriers should go out of their way to make a customer happy and take a little extra time to make things rite especially losing a sale because they can't transport it to the front door. One note to Home Depot if you want to continue losing customers over a shoddy delivery service so be it. But professionally it makes you look bad and in the Mean time I now shop at a different company that is more professional and has manners.,0,1

He was very helpful, courteous, and patient as he investigated the issue. It was discovered that the blind for custom measurement, A1, was not inputted at the time of purchase. He remedied the issue (and now we have blind A1 on the way!) and suggested we request the installation of the blinds that had been delivered on Dec. 17th and only pay 1 installation charge. He then transferred me to customer service to take care of arranging the installation. I was then connected to customer service who spent the time necessary with me to put in the request for installation and happily agreed to charge only one installation fee. She also went the extra mile by calling the installer directly to try and confirm the installation date & time.Both representatives displayed exemplary customer service. Although I would have preferred not having an issue to call about in the first place, (hence the 4 stars and not 5), the hour spent on the phone between the two of them was not frustrating at all and was a pleasant experience.",0,4

That said, I was pretty surprised when my store card was declined today. Especially when I had almost $80 credit on it. The credit was from an over payment, not an item returned.The reason cited was a bankruptcy filing on a bank card 11 months earlier. I imagine since last February, and so many out of work, I'm not the only one.If HD no longer wants my business, fine. I'll shop at ACE. They have better customer service any way.But the decision is hard to understand since I have been a good customer for over 10 years at HD. I have never made a late payment and have generally paid the full amount due within 1-3 months. It would be one thing to deny me from using their money, but my own money? I guess they were using my money for their own purposes as I was told I would get a check next month. They'd already had it for one.That doesn't fix a pipe fitting that's leaking now. and why should my good purchase history with HD be ruined by unfortunate circumstances with a bank any way?

So I reached out to Home Depot to help with my order, all they did is open a ticket to ""investigate"" this further. How about just not use this crappy shipping company any more?",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot has the worst customer…,"Home Depot has the worst customer service. I spoke with 6 people today and the last person who was supposed to be the ""escalation person"" spoke for literally 30 seconds and then the phone went silent as if I was on hold. After waiting for an additional 7 minutes I finally hung up. My issue, I was supposed to have a washer and dryer delivered on Monday and because the dryer was out of stock they called me and left a message saying that they were going to reschedule my delivery until January 22nd. I called to see if I could get the washing machine delivered on Monday since I did not ask to have the delivery rescheduled and I was told that I could not because they had to deliver both of the items together. I made the purchase on November 17th. With that being said I was concerned that if we separated the washer and dryer purchase but the prices would be the same and delivery on the washing machine could be sooner. I was told that we could separate the two if I canceled my initial order and we re-ordered, but I could not get a guarantee that the price would be the sales price that I paid on November 17th. Mostly I was told that delivery would have to happen after the first of the year which are the next available delivery times. So, what this means is because they couldn't get the dryer in a time, which I understood, they could not reschedule me for the original date that I was scheduled for by them and then they were going to possibly charge me more money and delay my delivery until after the first of the year. and I was told that the reason why they could not deliver the washer without the dryer was because they were on the same order and logistically it would be too difficult for them to separate the order. I want to say this again it was logistically too difficult for them to separate their order in order to deliver the item that was in stock. I honestly have never heard that from a company in my entire life. Well after not being able to talk to the escalation person I ended up calling another company which had the washer and dryer in the same predicament with the washer beam in stock and the dryer not coming until after the first of the year. in their case they took my order, match the price, and I've scheduled my delivery for before the end of this year and will come out and deliver the dryer when it finally becomes available. I plan on never shopping at Home Depot ever again because they do not have the customer and customer service as a priority.",0,1

When we buy a live Christmas tree, we are looking for a Christmas mood, a holiday for the whole family, gifts under the tree, and instead we get the tears of a child, disappointment and fear from realizing where else the ticks could crawl in the house. It is terribly unprofessional to sell such trees to unsuspecting people and expose people's health to such a risk without any control over the quality of living trees. I'm not talking about the spoiled mood! Be careful when buying live Christmas trees at Home Depot. It is terrible situation! 😢I can’t describe what my child feels now..",0,1

The one that was picked up has been in transit for over 2 weeks. I trip from Houston to Austin should not take 2 weeks. I contacted LSO today and they say the 1 shipment that they claim to have ""should"" be out today (we shall see).

They did not even notify me that they removed $400 worth item from the order, so I applied $49 worth coupon on $5 worth item to get 60 cents of discount. Talking ti their customer service over phone or IM was utterly horrible. They claim there was never $400 worth item on the order like I was making it up. Even their complaint department was useless.

After placing an online order for a faucet for delivery it was cancelled the following day without reason. When using the text option provided for questions I was repeatedly told I had ordered a towel rod that was out of stock. I was told that I had not ordered a faucet and that Home Depot was right because the order number is all that mattered. The associate refused to check for faucet availability based on the website order and the SKU number. I then contacted the 1-800 number where I was informed that the Internet numbers of the two products were incorrect. The order number Home Depot provided me linked to a towel rod while the Internet number linked to the faucet. They were unable to determine if the faucet was actually available in any of the stores in the Albuquerque-Santa Fe area. This associate was friendly but unable to provide a resolution of ordering the faucet. I then phoned the local store and spoke to the manager on duty. The manager now stated that the order number was pointing to the faucet but refused to check for stock status. He stated that he knew nothing about towel rods but that someone would have already checked for faucet availability before cancelling the order. Even after I explained that I had been repeatedly told that the towel rod I hadn't ordered was out of stock, the manager insisted that wasn't the case and that the order number only pointed to the faucet - although 2 other Home Depot associates contradicted this - he still refused to check for store availability, stating that I could try other Home Depot stores in Albuquerque or Santa Fe. This interactions with these store employees were horrible. I can't speak for other departments but if the manager and ""text"" employee are representative of the values at this store I will not be shopping here in the future.

The Home Depot,Dear reader do not make same mistake that I did avoid home Depot totally.,"Siavash Amani, WichitaDear reader, you my fined this writing not a perfect English. but I am sure, you will find that Home Depot is not place you want to do business with.I needed to change carpets of bedrooms in house I bought recently. First, I contracted a carpet installation with Home Depot on 11/10/2020. At singing of contract asked salesperson, “when do you think carpet be installed?” This salesman (at carpet department hardly would inform you of anything) “in one week or 10 working days someone will call you”. Said.(11/24/2020) 2 days before Thanksgiving I went to Home Depot at the customer service desk. I was directed to come back next day and Talk to a person CHAR (she supposed to be carpet installation expeditor).(11/25/2020) I returned the next day and talked to Char and explained my situation inside my house and asked her help. She got may correct phone number and told me I will talk to installer and will let you know. She never called me. On page 1 of contract, I found “ESTIMATED INSTALL END DATE: 12/10/2020” this mean that installation would finish before this date. I wait to see what will happen.Also, a found that salesperson had two wrong phone numbers on page1 in my name.12/1/2020 I found a phone massage from Carrollton, TX on my phone, massage from some carpet installer asking to call them. So, I called that phone and was connected to a person Mishal, seems to be some carpet installer’s scheduler. She told me I have scheduled you for 12/16/2020 which I disagreed with her, and she sound “TAKE IT OR LIVE IT”. Due to situation I am in, you must schedule for 12/09/2020, totally in disagreements. She had more them 20 days to schedule the project but did not, perhaps had more than she could chow. Any way she is working for different company, no use to argue thing with her. 12/7/2020 I thought It is better to talk to Home Depot Managers. They may be able to help and change the scheduling to 12/9 or even 12/11/2020. What I found Home Depot mangers are not able to do anything for costumer.12/9/2020 since I did not get any result last night, this morning about 11 AM stopped at costumer service desk and ask if I can talk about my case with on duty manger. A woman showed up, I tried to explain my case, “I know about your case” she said, reluctantly, and she took me where Char was sitting at her station. Before I get to where Char was, the woman manger had her moth at Char ear say something to her and pointing at me. After silent talk of on duty manager, Char took me to Service Desk and talked to woman at the desk do something. After a while I was presented by a piece of paper and telling me your work of carpet installation is canceled and this is your refund and you being charge 15% restock, which $329.90 for miss managing my purchase. It was shocking to me, without my agreement she canceled my contract, what I was insisting and asking them to do to install carpet as it was on contract, which totally all of them ignored my request. Contract salesperson wrote WRONG PHONE number con page 1 of contract.Expeditor (Char) decide to cancel my order without my consultation.Charging me for $329.90 for their mistakes, miss management, their conducts, which was impolite and unprofessional.Contract clear says (ESTIMATED INSTALL END DATE: 12/10/2020) which they did not follow.It was my fault in a way, I did not read review about jobs done by HD.I do recommend, avoid doing any kind of business with Home Depot invaliding contract, special order, installations and delivery. If you do you will pay for their mistakes and not getting service.HD punish customer for not getting service they singed for.Instead punishing and dismissing contractor not doing the job is committed to do.It seems this restoking business is better business, there for Home Depot encourage employees in that direction.This simple way is, the way people running Home Depot, if you are not agreeing with them you must go, no matter what, nobody there have time to take care and solve your problems. Do not recommend any contracting business with Home Depot, otherwise you will be punished and pay for you.",0,1

The Home Depot,Manufactured home door,On Friday December 4 2020 I called home depot inquiring about purchasing a door for my mobile home. The person said no problem just get the measurements and come pick out the door from a book we have of doors and when I asked if they install them he said absolutely. So Saturday December 5 my boyfriend went to the home depot and talked to a supervisor about how to measure the door the supervisor told him the owner of the home needed to come in to do all the transaction and they would come measure then order door and install it. Sunday December 6th we both went to Home Depot no one was there in that department to serve us. So today December 7 we went again to order the door have them come out measure it and install it only to be told they have no one at Home Depots to install mobile home doors due to their framing. I was highly disappointed to be mis led by two employees that told us yes they do them. Very poor training !!!,0,1

The Home Depot,An absolute JOKE,"This company is an absolute JOKE! I ordered a wet saw from Home Depot who utilizes this awful company... That was my only mistake in this matter. The driver stated that he delivered my package to my front door on 11/25. Funny thing is I have a Ring camera on my home which shows any activity in the front of my home and guess what... No delivery. Not even any movement at my home within hours of when it stated that the package was delivered. When I contacted FedEx, which was a joke, I was informed that they had to put through an investigation and I would have to wait. I've called FedEx 3 times at this point and last call I waited over an hour for someone just to hang up on me. I finally get a return call on 12/5 for them to say that they are still under investigation and they will not contact Home Depot to get my order refunded until the 8th. Which means that they are doing nothing at all to rectify the situation. I then contacted Home Depot customer service who informed me that they can't do anything because FedEx stated they delivered the package. I now have to go buy another 300$ wet saw as my home renovation is now on halt and just wait to see if they will actually do anything. I will not EVER have FedEx be a sender for anything I purchase in the future. This company is a big scam!!!! I will be adding reviews to all the sites so hopefully others can see how unorganized and unreliable this company really is.",0,1
The Home Depot,What an awful company,I ordered a wall oven. Home Depot set a delivery date of December 8. I needed the oven before Christmas. I invited my family for Christmas expecting them to honor their delivery date.

Why not tell the truth up front. Unlike other companies they already took the charge before delivery.,0,1

Checked my order status on the “delivery date” and it said it was delivered. NOPE! Hubby called and questioned it. They said they were waiting on the bank to clear. The bank was waiting on their system to go through to clear it. Called 6 days later (not getting a single form of communication like they claimed..I have been watching my phone waiting.. that’s a lot of money!! They claimed they called repeatedly) to get the story of their system crashed on thanksgiving and all online orders were messed up.. they should have shut the system down if they KNEW it crashed!! They didn’t and continued to let customers think their orders were processing. Said guy said that in order to “fix” situation, I would have to reorder, and get an additional $764 taken out of my acc, then call customer service rep next day to make sure original order money got refunded. (Yes they already took my $754 out of my account the 30th of November!!!!) I cancelled the entire purchase and now have to call the specialist tomorrow to make sure I get refunded. the guy made the comment “this stuff happens when you order online.” Well, I thought I could TRUST their program!! WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!! They could have at least waived a fee of some sort or something!! NEVER AGAIN!!",0,1
The Home Depot,"Damaged appliances, horrendous customer service that contradicts each other","First off, do not believe the statements online about certain appliances not being returnable. They probably WILL NOT let you return damaged products they send out, but at least make an attempt within 48 hours. If their customer service fails you, attempt a chargeback with your credit card company, AND DO NOT REMOVE THE DISPUTE. The first person at Home Depot convinced me they would replace the damaged unit they sent me once I removed the dispute. Once I did, the next “customer service” people rescinded what the first rep promised.We initially tried going through online assistance and reviews (they reject everything and claim lower reviews don’t meet their requirements, btw, so be suspect of all high reviews). Later, we found out, “Oh, yeah, our website is kinda messed up, it shouldn’t say we don’t take returns”. We weren’t aware that there is supposedly 48 hours to call (online service is a pure joke). Our appliance arrived smashed in two spots. I did not have it placed in the house due to the sketchy delivery people. My husband unpackaged on the porch when he got home. THE PACKAGING WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION BUT HOME DEPOT BLAMED SHIPPING. Typical “blame someone else”.The first young man I spoke with five days later was helpful and said they’d replace the freezer due to the website being convoluted and confusing. Next three individuals, who sounded like they were in the hood, eating, etc. were the rudest people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with - the last woman laughing at me, dead air when asking questions, etc. Anyway, the last few years we have spent thousands with them, including purchasing expensive scaffolding, etc. This was our final purchase. We try to give other companies than Amazon business, but I am at the point that I will be thrilled to help put these horrible companies out of business. The overseas Amazon service may not be the best, but is more helpful than Home Depot’s U.S. service!Oh, also bought a chandelier that arrived without parts. That originally was “call the manufacturer, we cannot send a part”. Paint that showed up OPENED and all over.Really, they just want to take your money and give no customer service anymore. Our local store is usually just like this last online experience. My favorite being when my husband needed several bags of rocks and the nose-ring wearing, tattooed from head to toe woman rolling her eyes, letting out a sigh like he was a burden and saying, “you need that many?” THEN, making an old man do the work! (I suppose all these wonderful staff people are of the “we deserve $15 minimum wage” variety.)",0,1

The Home Depot,Useless Extended Warranty.,"Their Extended Warranties are not worth the paper it is written on.I hadf purchased a Clothes Washer in 2018 and also purchased an extended warranty. In October, 2020, I needed to get my washer fixed. They sent out A1 Service who proceeded to analyze the problem over the phone. They never came out to see it. They than proceeded to order a part to be shipped to my house and told me to call them when it came in.When it finally came, I called them and the person on the other line told me to call back on Monday (This was on Friday). I questioned this and his reply was astounding. He said: ""What do you want me to do about this?"" He then went on that they wouldn't get to it till the following month.I called The Homer Depot to complain and they finally got me reassigned to another service agent. Elmo's Service Repair was assigned to complete this repair.They came out, looked at the machine and indicated that it needed a new computer board. The man than indicated that he would order it and come back after delivery to install the part.The next day, I noticed that the ticket from The Home Depot was closed. This seemed unusual so I called The Home Depot to see what is going on. I was informed by Shelley that the technician found a spider in the back and that it was unsafe for him to work there. Keep in mind that at no time did he indicate any of this to me. The home Depot would not allow me to reopen this ticket until I provided proof that this had been corrected. I talked with a supervisor named Richard who indicated the dame thing. This happened on Nov. 27th.I told Richard to have his manager return my call on Mon. This occurred on Friday which was Thanksgiving weekend. I ended up using Thumbtack.com and got a hold of Georges Appliance Repair. He came out on Monday and installed the part for me. It cost me $120 but was worth it.I finally got my call from The Home Depot and because of all of my troubles was able to negotiate a full refund of my contract fee for this extended warranty. That is about the only good thing from my experience.However, I will never purchase anything from The Home Depot and will never purchase another Extended Warranty.",0,1
The Home Depot,If I could give zero stars I would,"If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered a refrigerator in early November with a confirmed delivery date of 11/30. I received a confirmation of my delivery window on 11/27. On 11/40, the online tracker said my refrigerator was on the truck and that I was behind x number of people for my delivery. As my delivery time frame came and went, I received no call or follow up as to why. When I called to inquire, I was told the truck was running behind but they were still coming. They still never showed, and when I called again they said they had no record of my order, even though I was looking at it on my computer. They told me they would call in the morning because dispatch was closed and they couldn’t call the truck. The next morning, still no phone call and no information. When I called to find out where the refrigerator was, I was told they were running too behind to deliver it the night before but that it had now been unloaded from the truck and they couldn’t get it to me until a week later. All of this happened with NO phone calls from Home Depot to update me on my order. If I hadn’t called 5 different people, I would not have received any information at all. As far as I’m concerned, the refrigerator should have been delivered first thing the next morning - why should I have to go to the back of the line because they couldn’t get there on time? No one seemed to care - I’m just another number to them. I am beyond disappointed in Home Depot’s customer service and am appalled at their lack of communication, especially given that I’m in the middle of a kitchen remodel and am on a schedule myself. I will not ever use Home Depot for appliances again.",0,1

When I called I got a person that told me it had been delivered to my old address where I haven't lived for 6 years. She told me to go there and pick it up. I told her no. It would not fit in my car as the angels were 7 and a half feet tall and the boxes would not fit in my car. She said totell my credit card to credit my card . I told her that would not work and it wasn't my problem or the credit cards problem it was Home Depots problem and they had been paid and I want my money back. I called again and spoke to aonother associate who said she could try to send a carrier to pick it up and then they would refund my money if they could. I don't even know how to get in touch with these people. I asked for a supervisor and they gave me a person that said she could do noting except what I had been told already and if they could not recover the angels they would credit my account otherwise I just lose my money .

They did not stand behind the warranty but sent me to the manufacturer. The handle is only warrantied for one year from original purchase date, not installation. Further, they were having trouble getting handles from the supplier. Six months have elapsed, and they now have them. BUT, Home Depot says the only way to order is to come in person to the store during the worst Covid surge to date. I tried to put a bad review on the Home Depot site, and they wouldn't allow it. That is how I got suckered into this useless door to begin with, because they only show positive reviews. I have a useless, very expensive door that has been propped half way open with bricks holding it in place for 6 months and no safe way to fix it. I have been burnt for the last time by Home Depot.

The Home Depot,Home Depot's customer service is so…,"Home Depot's customer service is so terrible that I cannot find any words to describe it. First time I ordered a washer and dryer the technician did not install it and cancelled the whole order without my approval. I exactly know why and how he did it. My wife is not a native English speaker so it is obvious that the delivery employee tried to take advantage of this situation and they did. We live in a 4 story townhome and the laundry room is on the 3rd floor so I am %100 sure they did not want to carry the appliances up to the 3rd floor. They left a note saying that the depth of the washer and dryer is too large and it should be at or below 30"" which is not accurate because the previous washer and dryer set's depth was 34"". To get this issue sorted out, I have called your customer service line 5 times (where 2 times I was put on hold for 1 hour and 15 minutes) and requested that I would like to receive the washer and dryer not a refund. The second time I ordered a washer (the LG here) the delivery people brought it where one side of the washer was completely banged up (See Photos please!!) because someone dropped it when picking it up with a forklift. So me and my wife declined to have it installed and the delivery people ordered another washer who knows when we will receive it. Now I am on the phone with Home Depot Online and they are telling me that there is not another order under my name and I am about to go insane!!!!! From now on, I will make sure that I cancel my Home Depot Pro account and switch over to Lowe's. I will make sure to address these 2 issues to to your executives both by email and a letter. Home Depot should just terminate its customer service department simply because there are no follow ups, no professionalism and no care. I think terminating this department will save your company a lot of money. Home Depot Online Store is terrible and but the customer service is even more terrible.

However, the workers just put screws to the left side and the right side only. They skipped the work and not to put screws to the front side and the back side. They also took away most of the accessory parts that were included in the washers WITHOUT my permission and acknowledgment. They NEVER asked me if I wanted to keep the parts. They took away a Detergent Dispenser, an Elbow Bracket, two Wrenches, four Shipping Bolts for Mega washer, and all Non-skid Pads. These parts all had a total value of $100.

So I go back to the store (third trip) cancel the order and get my refund. ought dishwasher somewhere else, had it installed in two days. November 25th 7:35am, doorbell rings, someone is here to install dishwasher. OMG the level of incompetence is amazing. They need to fix their systems.",0,1
The Home Depot,I placed an online order for an item,"I placed an online order for an item, they ordered it to another location, I thought the money will be back to the account, if the client do not pick it up, it was less than 20$ , but actually they charge your card and marks it falsly as picked up to collect the item\funds from you ! they should be sued for that ! they did it already twice and every time it took more than a hour to get my funds back !When I told their manager that they can get sued for that, she just put the call on hold for 90 min untill I hanged out and called the store in person ! terrible experience, if someone is going to sau them , i am definitely in !",0,1
The Home Depot,Would give zero stars if possible,"Would give zero stars if possible. Purchased clothes dryer online. Earliest delivery is 7 weeks into future. BUT, credit card was immediately charged so I get to make payment weeks before product is delivered. But, I’m sure that they pay their suppliers when they order rather than after product is received. SURE. Also (probably stupidly) I purchased 5 year warranty plan. Received email the next day stating that warranty period begins on date of purchase. So I got to pay for warranty protection for the seven weeks before I even received the product. What a company. I promise, Lowe’s I’ll never make this mistake again. And, to top it off they make it virtually impossible to make a complaint without playing the phone game, which I refuse to waste my time doing.",0,1
The Home Depot,Another Dissatisfied Customer,"Written on behalf of Yvonne WallaceHere it is less than one week from Thanksgiving and my kitchen cabinets are still not done.As a customer, I did everything right and Home Depot (Store #2401 Portland, Maine) and American Woodmark Cabinets screwed me over.In September, I picked out my cabinets, Home Depot measured and delivery set for early November.Cabinets arrived on 11/16, damaged. Questionable if they even passed any Quality Assurance Department at the cabinet makers.Home Depot nor American Woodmark could guarantee me replacement before Thanksgiving and expected delivery early December but they still could not guarantee undamaged cabinets.My carpenter said he has never seen such a ""mess"" of cabinets. Not talking about a little ding, talking about five cabinets had huge corners broken off and multiple gouges throughout.If a minus score could be used for reviewing my satisfaction, it would be -100.Home Depot is there for the sale and zero customer service.Cabinet company wanted to offer us $400 off for our problems. What an insult.We told them to come get all the cabinets ASAP and credit my account.I will go elsewhere and try to start over.$10,000+ is not a drop in the bucket for this middle class family. We worked hard to save that money for a kitchen remodel.Never again will I step foot into a Home Depot.Signed,Very Dissatisfied customer",0,1

When I called customer service to discuss the new date (a month later) they said they would deliver it the customer service lady canceled my order by her own mistake rather than the delivery date. Was sent to her boss Jennifer in leadership that told me very rudely that nothing could be done and we would have to reorder our oven and go to the end of the list and get it after Jan 24th two month later. There is nothing they can and are willing to do to rectify their mistake for the cancellation. The worst customer service I have ever experienced.

Home Depot gave me a gift card to cover the damages if i accepted it the way it was. I accepted (after all who would see the back of the stove anyway). Little did I know that the dent in the back caused the oven not to function. I called Home Depot and Samsung and they bounced the blame back and forth on each other for a month. I was getting nowhere fast. Then a miracle happened by the name of Sonya Finley from Home Depot resolution dept. She got the ball rolling and contacted Samsung and kept in contact with me to follow up on the process and make sure everything was happening in a timely fashion. She was very easy to talk to and understood my frustrations and helped me to calm down. A few weeks later, I received my new stove and a gift card for my inconvenience. In a world where customer service has diminished greatly, Sonya exemplifies what true customer service should look like! My rating is solely based on Sonya's performance!",0,4
The Home Depot,Beware Buting mower from Home Depot,"In March of 2019 I purchased a GXI Z-Beast 48"" zero turn mower from home depot online. It was $2499.00. I purchased a 3 year extended warrantee with the mower. I'm a maintenance technician and repair equipment for a living and I know my business. The mower was fine until I had only 10 hours on it. I did the maintenance on time and when it was scheduled. At o ly ten hours I could not adjust the blade drive belt anymore. I was out of adjustments. I ordered to more belts and upon getting them they were both too large. And after I installed the first one it ate one of my belt guides. The belts adjusted fully out also around and make so much noise and you cant adjust the belt guides out enough to stop the racket, that when you do the belts jump off! Its rediculous. On top of all this I cannot get any customer service whatsoever. Home Depot qon't help me because it's still under manufacturers warrantee but, GXI will not return me any contact. I'm too the point where I might have to turn to legal action. This is crazy. I will never spend another dime at Home Depot.",0,1

I called customer service and your rep didn’t really say anything, but oh yeah they don’t have it. I told him it showed 5 items available and my tree is cancelled.

Actually kind of rude to me in front of my son. The only one that had a clue or even thanked me for my service was the young cashier and he even tried to explain the VAchoose card to them.

The Home Depot,Shame on home depot,Shame on home depot. I ordered a tool from you guys keep in mind I shop here frequently due to home remodeling y'all could have done better. The other day I non ordered a tool which you showed you had 4 of them so I ordered using E gift cards I got for myself to stay in a budget. The tool was.order and confirmed for pick up later in the day beyond ordered it early in the morning. I got a call six hours later telling me they cannot find the tool they don't have it even though they have four. They go on to tell me I had to come up there and get my money back on a gift card as store credit and I cannot order offline because it is now store credit. So now here I am forced to search for the tool in one of the store call around hoping one of the stors s have it and hopefully its not 50 miles from where I live. I feel when something like this happens it is not the customer fault because I wouldn't bought a tool you didn't have to force myslef to look high and low for a tool that can be 2 hours away from where I live since I have to go to a store because its store credit and I cannot buy using that 216 dollar credit. At this point you would think HOME DEPOT would have tired finding me the tool or upgrading me to a kit because they had the tool with the kit visable but the tool alone no where to be found but you have 4. At this point I'm being honest and tell the manager your employee s are hiding them if your system is still tell you there is 4 of them in the store somewhere. Then they suggest maybe I should buy one similar that is not cordless. That is not what I want and not what I paid for and those are cheaper I don't want to walk away with store credit remaining because then I fell like you stole my money since your already forcing me to store credit. i do under Dewalt yool aren't cheap but you would think as long as HOME DEPOT been around they would have upgraded me to the tool with the kit since its only the tool and battery and charger which they didn't only if I was going to pay the difference. I swear I said I had a budget and giving y'all one hundred and fifty extra dollars for your mistake no.Home Depot in Arizona can do better compromise with the customer and not rob our pockets locking me in to one position only being able to spend inside the stores covid-19 is real and I rather not be in and out of a store searching for a tool. I rate Home Depot careless for asking the customer to search around for a tool drive past 15 miles in a pandemic when I could be at home waiting for the tool to come to my house.,0,1

We order a Frigidare stove from them, just to have the manufacturer, Whirlpool, call the day before the scheduled delivery to say delivery was being postponed for 3 weeks. Three weeks later, they did it again, postponing the delivery for another month. So we canceled the order, and bought a different brand that the Home Depot manager thought was in stock and ready for delivery in 4 days. It wasn't, because 2 days later Samsung called to postpone delivery for two weeks. Who knows if it will actually be delivery on the new delivery date or postponed again. Yet Home Depot keeps advertising they're appliance sale, with no ability to keep their promised delivery dates. Shop somewhere else where you can take the appliance home the day you buy it.",0,1

The Home Depot,Worse Customer Service Experience…,"Worse Customer Service Experience EVER!!! STORE 6530 Rosenburg, TexasPlaced an order online with another store 6561 (Grand Parkway) because it showed that they have the order in their inventory. Scheduled and paid for a 2 days delivery. On day of delivery, called the store and was told Store 6530 (Rosenburg) was the store that would be doing the final delivery. Called this store and the Manager stated there was nothing she could do about my order since it has been rescheduled for the next day and I was just calling at 4pm. Told her I place the order early online (2 days) prior and only called since I didn't get any delivery update from them so It was not like I was just calling at 4pm given the fact I had already scheduled my vendors that would be using the inventory to work on my project for the next day at 8am. Did care a bit. Asked why I was not called to be updated on this delay, NO Responses. Asked to given a window when the delivery will be done, stated between 6am to 8pm. Asked if She could confirm an opening between 6am to 8am, she said NO!!. Told her I would call Corporate and give reviews on all social media about this bad experience I just had with them and hung up. So long story short, I didn't get my order per the scheduled date. If you place an order online with this or ANY HOME DEPOT store, start calling them ASAP just to ensure that your order is truly available in their store (they don't update their inventory rightly per my conversation with the Corporate office), ensure you go pick up rather than schedule for them to deliver cos they don't have the trucks or flat beds, and also their customer service SUCKS!!!They cannot help nor are they bother to help resolve your issues.Its a SHAME you make your customer believe they are getting the right services they paid for!!**Update*** Next DayI was called that my items was on the way for delivery.Delivery guy was given only 20 of my 60 rebars ordered. Said they told him it was 60. We both took pictures and I called back the store, they kept me on hold for 27 mins only to be told they will start processing my 40 items to be delivered the next day. What is wrong with this store!!!!Later called and request for my refund, was told i will be called with the refund info. A guy call from another Home Depot store (completely different and not close to my home) and stated i needed to come to his store to swipe my card in order to get my refund. Asked him how his store got involved since i had nothing to do with his store, he stated they must had wrongly called his store instead of the initial store the order identified when i made my payment that it was the Rosenburg's store's mistake.Told him the same way someone mistook my 60 items delivery as a 20. When will they learn. Their attention to details is sad... Told him I refuse to go into a store for a refund for an online purchase and that they all (making a total of 4 home depot store Grand Parkway, Kings Bridge, Rosenburg and now Katy) should fix their issues and refund my money. I AM TOTALLY DONE WITH HOME DEPOT... THIS IS A BIG SHAME ON YOU GUYS!!!!!! YOU ALL DROPPED THE BALL. Corporate need to ensure they have the right people working for them",0,1

Was told had washer and dryer in stock and would be delivered 19 November. 18 November I never received a phone call and I contacted the Home Depot help line. “Yes the delivery team didn’t call because the washer won’t be in stock till 14 December at earliest.” What a joke Home Depot, I have been without washer and dryer since I placed my order with you 29 October.

She said there's no manager. So she said I'll see what I can take ack. she pick and chose the smaller items and my boss said what about this and that. She said go to those departments and have them each give you a scan code.

The Home Depot,Go ANYWHERE else. Dont buy anything from Home Depot,Bought a refrigerator and microwave from home depot. Paid to have microwave installed above stove in early October. They were delivered October 30th. The refrigerator came as a right swing and needed to be switched to a left swing. The delivery people said that changing the door swing was not on the order. Checked later and it was on the order. I had to spend an hour figuring out how to change it myself. The microwave install looked okay but as I placed dishes back into the cupboard above the microwave I discovered they had installed a large screw at a sideways angle and it was sticking up so bad I kept hitting it with dishes. Just a totally incompetent poor job.Now I've been trying to get them back out here to fix this screw. They were scheduled to be here today so I stayed home all day saturday waiting for them to show up. At 7pm I called the home depot and was told they were on customer 16 and I was #18.

It was the worst day ever I was about to move into my new house 3 weeks with no appliances at all. She informed me cause my order was cancelled and other people had ordered in the mean time Samsung was making sure they filled there orders first. So I had no choice but to get a refund for appliances I did in fact pay for. She did not offer me other appliance nothing other then iam sorry nothing else. So off I go to lowes the next day nov 8 they were so helpful and thanks to them less then a week later I have my appliances so now I can cook in my house have fridge washer dryer no thanks to home depot. We just finshed a major reno in our new house spent a lot of money at home depot pryer to all this if I could I would rip everything and take it all back and shop at lowes.

The Home Depot,I#maytag#allmyassociates,"I#maytag#allmyassociates#HomeDepotdidntDeposit#Sept. 16thRenovation is a difficult task.Upon completing a job I went to purchase the appliances here at Home Depot. Samantha was my sales associate and thoroughly checked to see what items were in stock or on back order. I left feeling confident my items( 5 major appliances & accessories) would be delivered on Sept. 25th only to receive a automatic voice controlled voicemail rescheduling my delivery 1 day prior to my delivery date to/for Oct. 9th (my clients birthday). After this date passes with another automatic voice controlled voicemail rescheduling my delivery Oct. 16th... the same took place at least another 3 times Oct. 30th, Nov. 6th and lastly Nov. 13th all with 1 days notice to the cancel-reschedule. At which time I went into the store(after several phone calls & attempts) only to speak with a variety of employees who knew little about their own merchandise they sold me and delivery. With these same items on the floor on sale to choose from even on today. Amber & another assistant started off to be somewhat helpful but passed me off to Victoria from the appliance department. Only to be like a redundant recording.... ""it's Maytag that you have a problem with not Home Depot"". Only Maytag can make this right.... and only if you don't cancel your order and wait for a partial delivery of a possible 2 of the 5 appliances you purchased to be delivered on Nov. 19th(another promised delivery date) to which I did not have any confidence based on other promised delivery dates. Victoria could sense my lack of faith in her promises of this partial delivery she then goes into a spill of how the items come from China and parts or in a shortage etc... She even made mention that COSTCO has their own warehouse and has inventory to keep delivery dates. Not once was there any empathy to the facts that I have a client without a stove to cook on, a refrigerator to keep groceries, washer & dryer and a dishwasher to assist in the kitchen. She then calls over a manager(assistant manager) Helen. Upon Helen's arrival her attitude was evident there would be no progress any further than that what had transpired thus far - none. She also spewed the same rhetoric with a take it or leave it attitude. A simple I do understand sir would of went a long way. Rethinking a long history of patronizing this company.",0,1

Supposed to be delivered Oct 14. That was pushed back to Nov 14. Just got a call today (all automated by whirlpool btw) and now it's supposedly Dec 14. Called the Home Depot store where we made the purchase. I did not have my order number as the paperwork is in my car and remote to where I was at the time. The manager could not find my order using my phone number or name. I asked how can you not find my order by the phone number at least? Whirlpool was able to call me about it somehow? Trying to get a hold of them is impossible too. I told him I wanted to cancel the order and get my money back. waiting 3 months (or more) is ridiculous. How do I go about doing that? He said well I can't find your order..... Seriously? I said I was coming there with my order form later in the evening, and to have a refund waiting, and asked for his name......he hung up on me! At this point I just want my money back. I don't care if I have to wait for delivery from another company or manufacturer. It's the point we had a contracted delivery date with Home Depot and Whirlpool. I'll buy from someone else.",0,1

Currently I will not even purchase a nail from Home Depot if I can help it. If you have a Credit Card from Home Depot beware. Yesterday I went to purchase a Honeywell Thermostat from Home Depot. The Cashier stated why don't you get a Home Depot card. I thought we had one, however they could not locate it so I said it was ok I would receive a $40 off so I applied for the card. Never in all my life have I been rejected well it happened but the reason was really frightening, instead of my name when I put in my SS my daughter's name came up, she lives with us and is an adult . She has her own credit, how did this happen. Then the man said no you will be approved let's call, I said fine, figured an account would help him. Another 15 minutes later the card was approved, of course when they went to purchase once again there was a block, some one came on the phone said they would send out a code I had to give them the code etc, by now almost 30 minutes was gone. I decided I did not want the Thermostat as the mechanic had left and left Home Depot. I suggest no one shops at Home depot, their credit division stinks and they are dangerous. I came home and we already had a HD card. So their Credit Company needs to be totally shown the door. DONT SHOP HOME DEPOT",0,1

The Home Depot,Their return policy on major appliances…,"Their return policy on major appliances is a JOKE!! You have 48 hours to return an item if it’s damaged. Other than that they don’t give a d@mn about why you want to return it or exchange it. I called corporate and the “representative” that took my called said they in the corporate world call my reason for wanting a return “buyers remorse”!!! I told her to show me where on the store return policy it talks about buyers remorse. My item has not been opened, it is still the original box it was shipped in. The worst part of this whole NIGHTMARE is that one store said yes to the return with a 15% out of pocket but then when they tried to do the return the “system” didn’t allow it and they changed their tune and said for me to go to the store I bought it from because they don’t accept returns from other stores! I went to the original store and they are refusing the return, they call the manufacturers when they know very well it is up to Home Depot management to accept the unopened item. A complete horrible experience with Home Depot where “Customer satisfaction is guaranteed”! Now I’m stuck with the wrong size item and they keep getting rich on our hard earned money!!!",0,1
The Home Depot,Worst customer service ever,"On August 9th I visited the Norristown, Pa location looking to purchase items for a kitchen remodel. Specifically cabinets, flooring, back splash, sink, and a counter top. We asked for assistance and were told that the only person that could help us was at lunch but would be back in 5 minutes. After 30 minutes we asked to speak to the manager. He was EXCEEDINGLY rude. He said that his employees were entitled to a lunch break and that she would be back at the end of her lunch. I informed the manager I had no problem with anyone having a lunch break but wished that correct information would have been relayed to me at any point in my three visits to customer service. When we were finally able to talk to someone, we were told that we would have to physically go to three different locations to pick up the cabinets since they were in stock at those locations and they were NOT permitted to ship them as I had wanted. When we arrived to pick up the cabinets, we had to wait 35 minutes. At first, they only brought out three cabinets. He said one cabinet was on order and we would have to come back another day, which is not what my message indicated. When we then went to the Conshohocken, PA location to pick up 3 more cabinets we were told that they were being shipped from Maryland and not available, even though we were told they were in inventory at that store. At EVERY point of this process, we have received incorrect information. I was interested in opening a Home Depot credit card to save money as the signs all over the store indicated, but was NEVER given that opportunity as I had to purchase the items from multiple locations on separate orders. So far, I have spent over $5,000 so the savings would have been significant. Is this common practice for how Home Depot not only treats their customers but how they operate? My suggestion for shoppers would be to save yourself a lot of money, aggravation and time and go to Lowes!",0,1

The Home Depot,Poor Window Installation - Breach of Warranty,"I purchased 9 Simonton 6500 windows from HD. The warranties vary by windows however, these come with a Lifetime Warranty Installation and Double Lifetime Craftsmanship Warranty so this is transferable to the next resident. The windows were poorly installed initially. We had leaking in a few of the windows resulting in rotted trim. We have continued to contact HD to fix the issues through Installation Services and Customer Care. In April, they sent out two Certified HD Exteriors representatives to assess our windows. They were shocked at the installation of the windows and determined each window would need to be reset, new wood trim around each window to replace the plastic snap trim which should not have been used, caulked and paint the new trim. They determined the proper shims or supports were not used during the initial installation. As a result, one of the windows is sagging or ""smiling"" at the bottom. We are also experiencing severe drafts through the windows and continue to have to reposition the plastic snap trim because it snaps out of place.We were planning to replace the siding on two sides of the house and wanted to coordinate this project with the windows. The HD installers told us to leave the wood trim off around those windows since they would be replacing it. We coordinated the siding project to complete the week prior to our scheduled date with the contracting company for HD on July 28.Our siding was complete on July 21. Duct tape was placed around the windows since the wood trim was scheduled to be installed less than a week out. The old trim was too worn to reinstall. The week the HD contractors was scheduled to complete our work order, the Crew Manager called to let us know one of the installers had been hospitalized with heat exhaustion and they would have to reschedule. Subsequently, their workload was pushed back and the 60 days expiration on approved projects set by HD had been met. The Crew Manager told us he would have to send the work order back to HD for approval. Since August, we have been calling and e-mailing HD in an effort to get this resolved. We have been ignored repeatedly. We even filed a BBB complaint and they denied our request stating we nullified the warranty. These are the 3 reasons given by the HDIS Mgr:1. We painted the windows. I sent pictures of the windows showing that it is caulk smeared on the plastic trim by their installers and not paint2. We needed to maintain yearly caulking. In the warranty, it states caulking is the responsibility of the homeowner. We have applied caulk but no amount of caulk can fix windows missing proper shims or supports which should have been installed during the initial installation. 3. The labor is under warranty for only 1 year. The warranty clearly states Lifetime Warranty on Installation for as long as you own your home in the Peace of Mind brochure and the Simonton Warranty for the 6500 series. I called the HD store and spoke with someone in the windows department. He verified the windows installation is backed by a lifetime warranty on the installation. This warranty is also front and center on their website and in their literature. During the confusion of having the work order approved for the second time, HD sent it to a different contracting company. The Certified HD Exteriors Representative from this company had the same assessment as the first installers who came out in April. So, three representatives from two different contracting companies had the same conclusion about our improperly installed windows. We found out from a HD employee, all of the employees involved in windows including salespeople, were fired from HD in January 2020. This action indicates there are many issues with their windows installation department. I posted on Nextdoor, asking for recommendations to have our wood trim replaced and posted about our unsatisfactory experience with HD. The General Manager of the local HD store replied to my post. He said he wanted to help us resolve the issue.I sent him a detailed e-mail, including photos. It was the same information we have been trying to escalate through Installation Services and Customer Care at HD. In less than week, he told us he was unable to get anything accomplished and they told him to remove himself from the process and he should not even be speaking with us. I asked him if he could at least spot us the wood trim, paint and caulk since we would now need to pay for those items and the installation and resetting of our windows out of our own pocket. He said he would have to think about it and did not respond. Currently, I have duct tape on five of my windows and no resolution with HD. HD needs to remove the lifetime warranty from their website and literature since they do not stand by their warranty on their labor. It's misleading.",0,1

When I got the email to pick it up, my husband went to get it and there were only 10 boxes (which was not enough for her room, so was useless) They said they had no more anywhere so they had to cancel the order (without giving a receipt saying my credit card was credited). They should never have let us order that much they didn't even have it, and they should have let us know they didn't have it and save us a trip to Home Depot.

The Home Depot,The worst customer experience ever,The worst customer experience ever. I wish I looked at trustpilot before placing an order online. Will not purchase from them again. Issues: 1) online order estimate date is not correct. Off by a week. 2) when you call - you don’t get resolution. Reps are rude and poorly trained. Provide contradicting information. Spent 1 hour and 10min without any resolution. 3) can’t escalate to supervisor/manager. Can only create a ticket that gets manager to call you back within 24 hours. 4) phone disconnected for 10min. Luckily I stayed on because it randomly reconnected. I thought the woman was pretending to not hear me so I hang up but glad I stayed on to get re-connected. The rep did apologize for the glitch and said she was “logged out” of the system which is why it disconnected. Most of their products are available on other websites. Definitely not worth buying from them if you can find on Wayfair or Amazon with much better support in case of smth going wrong.

He finally mumbled something to me, and I asked him what he said. He kept on mumbling and when I asked him to speak up he got quieter. This got me upset and I started demanding to see a manager. I had to request this multiple times before he finally pulled another clerk over who then proceeded to chew me out for not knowing that he was asking me to give him a job name.If your clerks are incapable of making themselves understood, then they shouldn't be clerks.

Home Depot would only give us the lower price when we returned it. We actually paid 50.00 more for the more expensive item. So home depot basically ripped us off by 50.00. Also, called another store that they showed 3 in stock of the size we need. They originally said they didn't have them in stock so we had to make 2 calls to find out if they actually had them . When we got there. All they had was broken. Husband and I decided we would never go back to home depot again. What a Rip off store. Poor quality merchandise, and poor quality service.",0,1

If you truly care about your customers, you would do something about your terrible delivery service. 10/31/20 I was to have a refrigerator delivered. The delivery driver called and left a message that he would be there in 30 minutes. As we waited, we moved the refrigerator out and cleaned the area making it super easy for the delivery guys. In the mean time (and without our knowledge) a man from the delivery service walked up to the door up to about 10 feet from our door then immediately turned around and walked to his truck. He did not knock or ring our RING doorbell. About an hour later we wondered where he was. We called and we were told that we would have to reschedule because they were there and nobody was home. Talking to Amber at the delivery service was no help. She was very aggressive with me and could not explain why the driver did not ring the doorbell or knock. It’s ONLY their protocol to call the customer. They are not required to knock. I told her I had a video from my Ring Doorbell that shows the driver walking up and immediately turning around taking a picture of our address and leaving. We received a second phone call from an unknown number with NO message left 3 minutes after our Ring said he walked up and then left. (I have no idea if this was him or not) Our only option was to reschedule. The reason being was because he has 13 deliveries to get done and so he was not going to have time to return. I never received a phone call from the delivery service after that day NOR did I hear from Home Depot. Order Cancelled! Really Home Depot? I have a video if anyone from your management is interested.",0,1

The Home Depot,Do not buy appliances from Home Depot!,"I wish there was a minus 0 rating. I ordered a new fridge and dishwasher in May 2020. I bought additional insurance.

They come in and said nothing was wrong with it and tried to tell me to do things differently. I tried that for a few weeks, leaks again. I call. Samsung comes in September and this time takes it apart. Samsung found a crack they said occured during installation or delivery. They said it was no longer on their ha d and I needed to call home depot. I call home depot and they refer to the department that covers the extra insurance. Those one said no it is Samsung and I call back Samsung said bo. I get both on the phone at the same time, they both agree that the store I bought from should handle it. I bought my devices online though. So I call home depot general 1800 number, they said call your Hamilton Ave in Brooklyn store and talk to the Manager Anthony R. At this point I think Anthony is a fictional character because he never materialized but he has a bunch if minions who protect him very well and give you all sort of divergent i formation. I was told to remove the dishwasher and bring it to the store and pick up another one. Now maybe some people have these skills. I paid home depot for installation and delivery. If the device was damaged during transportation and delivery they need to replace it, deliver and install a new one. No one seems to know what to do and nothing has been done, in the meantime the device is sitting right here. The communication, process, follow through and delivery of decent services are ALL terrible and subpar. Do not buy appliances from home depot. They do not care about your needs, just your wallet. Take your money where you are respected and valued as a customer. Buy directly from the manufacturers if you can. Samsung was great.

You would think that with the proper receipt, unopened package, same credit card, and my valid drivers license that at minimum they would give an in-store credit. A 40 mile round trip, 2hr discussion for a simple return has left me enraged! Wasted another hour on a phone call to be told we’ll send you a form to fill out and get back to you in maybe 2-weeks. Going to contact BBB and fraud dept with WI States Attorney’s Office over a simple return. Ridiculous. 1 star rating because it wouldn’t let me leave 0 or negative stars.",0,1
The Home Depot,I purchased an extended warranty plan…,I purchased an extended warranty plan in November 2019 on my fridge. My refrigerator broke on 10/27/20. I had two appointments for them to come out because they kept canceling each appointment come to find out the extended warranty that they sold me nobody excepts it so they are trying to find a service center or a company that will come out and fix my refrigerator. its going on a week that I’ve been without a refrigerator. When i call Homedepot to ask what is going on they keep making excuses. Saying they’re trying to find somebody to fix it but they’ve been trying since 10/27. All I want is a working refrigerator. I was just told it could take up to another three days for someone to contact me about the situation. Very frustrated with Homedepot.,0,1

Great, my son flies home to help me install them. we call on 10/23, they aren't there. maybe just not received in yet. So we go on Saturday, Dan tries to find then, they aren't there. Talk to Hannah in customer service. she calls the vendor, they tried to deliver them , but the store was closed (among the first of several lies, I since have been told the store is nearly 24x7 for deliveries. )......was told they'll be there on Friday 10/30.....10/30, no cabinets, truck didn't arrive (second of several lies)....ask to speak to the store manager,. they gave me Mike, who really had a very poor attitude about it.....nothing he can do. So Saturday I go to the store, talk to Dan, he cant believe it. I either want my cabinets or a refund. Melissa says better call Mike.....Mike comes, turns out hes not the store manager, (another lie)the store manager is Matt. I ask to speak to Matt. Mike told me hes not in( another baldface lie).

I offered to drive and pick them up. Hell, get me a truck, I'll bring a whole load back.....I turned to leave and who is there but another young man, wearing a orange apron with the name of MATT and STORE MANAGER on it.....Mike lied right to my face !!!!

They only installed our fridge by plugging it in without turning on the water line. They shoved our stove in. They didn’t remove the old dishwasher or washer and dryer. The new appliances are sitting in our hallway. They said they couldn’t install the microwave because it wouldn’t fit because of our backsplash. We took the template out and it would have fit perfect. They said they couldn’t install the dishwasher because it was double walled. We pulled the dishwasher out and it’s not double walled. They said they can’t install stackable washers and dryers because that’s not what they do. According to the supposed general manager that we talked to, they do it and should have done it. The two delivery boys were rude, cussing and obnoxious. The so-called manager, named TROY from the Bay City, MI store, was also rude and sided with the two delivery guys. He also basically said we lied telling him about the confirmations from those 3 people. He then basically said Have a nice day before he hung up. We called back and will be going over his head unless he makes this right. We now have a dishwasher, microwave, washer and dryer sitting in our hallway and even though we paid to have them installed and the old ones removed, the so called manager says too bad, not our problem. Haven’t resolved this matter yet but we will come hell or high water. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING ANY WHERE ELSE THAN HOME DEPOT IF YOU BUY APPLIANCES unless you can pick them up and install yourself. BTW: we also bought all our tile, flooring and accent tiling for the remodeling of our two showers from this store so I would say we’ve spent some major bucks there.....but never again.",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot Consumer Credit Card hassle,"2 weeks ago I went to my local Home Depot to purchase a new lawn mower. When I went to check out i was talked into applying for the Home Depot Credit Card by the clerk and if accepted there would be a significant discount on the mower (cant remember what it was). I applied for the card got approved with a 5k spending limit and walked out with the new Lawn Mower. I received my card in the mail and went online to register the card. The website would not let me register the card and I was asked to call the phone # for HD Consumer Credit card services. They said I had to verify that I was who a said I was. During this conversation about verifying myself i got the feeling that the rep. was not believing that I was who I said I was and that I was running some kind of scam. She said "" we have to make sure that you are who you say you are and that you are not a scammer trying to apply for this card using someone else's identity. I asked her why are you saying this and that I have several credit cards including a Lowes card in my name. She would not explain here inquiry and at the end of the phone call nothing was confirmed and my HD Consumer CC is currently frozen. I have worked for years to fix my credit since my home was foreclosed on back in the 2000's. I never make a late payment and I rarely use my cards. Currently, I have an outstanding balance for a lawn mower that I have no way of paying off because they wont verify me to have this credit account. I understand that in today's world we need to be vigilant in protecting identity but this here makes NO SENSE.",0,2

The Home Depot,Bad Customer Service Policy for ONLINE Store.,"This is a review about the ONLINE store.If you buy from the online store, don't expect great customer service if you have problem this is more about the policy and less about the people.In short - they do not take responsibility or offer any resolution to make sure the delivery gets to me.I ordered a lawn mower, it got shipped with UPS. They didn't deliver on time, and I checked and saw they couldn't verify the address. After multiple calls over a few days to UPS, product still did not get delivered (It got shipped to a different state! what..?) and eventually got returned to home depot. I called to ask them to reship it - home depot said they cant, and I have to re-order it (and get refund for the first order) The rep said something to the effect that they cant really communicate with the carrier. Okay. I reordered, and this time called their service to make sure they follow up to see it actually gets to me - so i don't have to babysit the UPS tracking number.The reaction I got was: we cant really communicate with the carrier. So if the customer cant communicate with the carrier (Cause i tried multiple times on the first order and it didn't work), and the seller can't communicate with the carrier - who is responsible here to ensure the product gets to the customer?At some point the rep said it was up to me to be in touch with the carrier.To me this is a pretty bad shaking off of responsibility - especially since I complained that despite my communication efforts last time, product still didnt get delivered. I expected that on my *second* attempt to buy an item, and after giving home depot another try, they would do their best to make sure the item arrives on time (and at all!), instead of telling me they cant do anything and its up to me.This was pretty bad customer service (again, people were mostly nice except for the supervisor, but the policy is just wrong). They should be taking more responsibility over their orders, and if the carrier isn't doing a good job, use a different carrier.This is very odd to me that a company this big just easily shakes responsibility and offers no resolution.",0,1

On the third attempt the delivery team refused to turn the machine so they could fit through the door and instead left it in my GARAGE.

The Home Depot,Delivery is TERRIBLE.,"I bought a washer and dryer from Home depot about a week ago. The salesman was courteous and helpful. This review is not about that, its about the delivery experience I have had TWICE with them, which is, to say the least HORRIBLE. We scheduled delivery to take place today. My wife received a text that they would arrive between 1:30 and 5:30 PM. I took a day off from work to be here. Well, 5:30 came and went, we received a call that they were ""running late"" and the delivery would be after 6 PM. Ok, I was miffed but I understand traffic, etc., can make this happen. so Finally at approximately 7PM, they arrive, two delivery guys, neither one wearing a mask, which bothered me, but I kept social distance, then they proceed to tell me that the knob on the washer is broken. So I could not take the delivery. Two things. ONE check items to make sure there is no damage BEFORE loading them on a truck. And TWO, don't overload your drivers with too many deliveries so they are perpetually late, it gives the perception that management at home depot could care LESS about their customers experience. I bought a dishwasher from them a couple years ago and the delivery was late by several hours for the same reason. I do not blame the drivers for this, I blame BAD MANAGEMENT for this. I almost quit home depot as a customer that time, but decided to give them another chance. Well, you have now lost me as a customer. I wonder how much money your apathy is costing you?

When asked if there was anything they could to to compensate us for the increased cost (contractor putting in the few cabinets we had, paying for missing cabinets that were not even ordered in the first place, and having to eat out), inconvenience and stress, I was told that since we returned the cabinets and got a refund, there was nothing they could do. Nothing? Really? I've filed a complaint, so we'll see where that gets us. #homedepotsucks",0,1
The Home Depot,STEER CLEAR,"The absolute WORST customer service. We paid over $26k to Home Depot for cabinet refacing and new countertops. The countertop work through their subcontractor was fine, but the cabinet installers screwed up and it took nearly 5 MONTHS for them to fix the mistake. Half of that time was due to their installation office not getting our paperwork “into the correct hands,” so 6 weeks went by without our materials being ordered. I had to waste my own time following up with them repeatedly just to get a response. We asked for compensation due to the length of time, some damage, and having to delay other work and we haven’t heard a peep. They are totally ignoring us now. We will never spend another dime with this company. We live closer to HD but will drive a littler farther to give their competitor our money.",0,1

The Home Depot,HORRIBLE!,"HORRIBLE!I just purchased my first home and bought a washer and dryer unit from home depot with delivery and installation. The first time they came to deliver, the delivery guys took dimensions in my stairway and everything was good until I inspected the unit and it was completely dented in the front. I refused the delivery and they scheduled a redelivery a week later. Second delivery comes and the guy looks at the stairs and immediately says this is not going to fit, I have to call my supervisor to ""see what's going on"". Long story short, I had to refuse that delivery and file a chargeback with my credit card as they wanted to just drop off the unit in my LIVING ROOM. This is ridiculous. I wasn't offered an apology or credit and the home depot person on the phone was rude, and hung up on me. Ended up at Lowes 2 hours later and purchased a $2k washer/dryer set with delivery 4 days later. No issues, paid more but received decent service which I'm happy to pay for. WILL NEVER USE HOME DEPOT EVER AGAIN. MY BROTHER IS BUYING A HOUSE AND LOOKING FOR ALL HIS APPLIANCES, HE'S GOING TO LOWES BECAUSE OF THIS. Screw you home depot, you lost multiple customers for life.",0,1
The Home Depot,KITCHEN HORROR STORY!!,"Got a kitchen designed by a designer at Home Depot in Duluth, MN. I gave them the right measurements. The designer put in the WRONG measurements (without my knowledge), and designed the kitchen with the wrong measurements. The design he drew up looked passable to me because I’m not a friggin carpenter/interior designer. We just thought we could leave it up to the professionals to get us we wanted. Anywasy, the cabinets were ordered and the contractor we hired started to install. He noticed irregularities with the design. Our sink is completely off of the center of the window and our dishwasher doesn’t even fit! We’ve got wall cabinets that needed to be placed elsewhere and one that couldn’t fit at all and needs to be taken back. After noticing these problems, we compared our measurement to the measurements the designer used. AND THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG!! So I went into Home Depot to try and have a decent conversation with their kitchen design team, but of course they wouldn’t listen. Who would admit their own mistakes these days? They telling don’t think they need to fix this problem. The mistake they made, they’re not taking responsibility for. I don’t normally get upset about things, but this has me losing my s**t. I will never go to Home Depot for services, large orders or anything else besides stuff I can buy right in the store. We spent a lot of money on these cabinets and they’re not even willing to fix their mistake.",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot Delivered Damaged Goods.  Buyer stuck with it.,"July 4th, 2020 weekend, we purchased a 4 piece appliance package; delivered about 1-2 weeks later. No known issues as boxes appeared to be in good shape upon arrival. They were stored inside our main home as the backyard guest home was still in construction. Two months later, our builder dollied the appliances out with my wife present. The refrigerator box was removed and there was an 8-10"" significantly crushed-in area of the refrigerator. The dishwasher had mild blemishes on the front surface as well.We immediately let the Spring Cypress (Cypress, TX) Home Depot know of the refrigerator issue and their response was, ""Sorry it's been over 48 hours. Nothing we can do."" They then said, ""Call Samsung."" And, ""At delivery, you have 48 hours to register any concerns."" We never were advised, informed, or told by anyone at any time, that Home Depot has a 48hr return appliance policy upon delivery. We never signed anything nor was it ever presented to us that that was their policy with appliances. We were made aware of their appliance policy after the fact when we saw it on their website. Very disappointed by Home Depot's gross omission as it should have been clearly stated to the buyer very easily. It wasn't though.That day, my wife drove to the store, spoke with management, and after 2 hours and a few more hours spent on phone calls trying to resolve this major issue, Home Depot said they would take the refrigerator back by charging us a 15% restocking fee and also charge us $79 for picking up the refrigerator! That is unconscionable. It is unreal that Home Depot summarily blew us off. As though we were an inconvenience. After lots of time and energy on my wife's part, they grudgingly allowed the return less those fees. All we wanted/anticipated was a replacement of the same product. After all, it was an unused, brand new refrigerator, delivered damaged under their entire control. How does this billion-dollar company get away with screwing people over like this? It is a brand new refrigerator, which we ordered in good faith, they took the money, delivered the product, and then washed their hands of any responsibility. It arrived crushed and yet we are penalized and blown off by management. Had we known of the 48 hr policy, we would have removed all the boxes immediately upon delivery to inspect the product. Nevertheless, Home Depot is shameless and demonstrated its easy ability to take advantage of their small customers.",0,1

The boxes were delivered by UPS and we're left on my driveway as if they were trash. There were a few boxes that were opened so not sure if any pieces fell out etc called the company The Stow Company to let them know how bad their shipping standards are and I was told it's Home Depot fault for using UPS and not a freight carrier like they recommend. Called Home Depot requesting a refund and place a new order of the same system and I was told I had to physically return them myself or have UPS pick them up but if any boxes are open UPS won't pick them up. I explained to Home Depot that I physically can't return to the store or tape boxes up because they are heavy and I'm very limited on what I can do. I was told nothing else they could you. I've learned my lesson no more big box stores sticking to my local owned stores from now on.,0,1

Then I left the store forgetting one of my bags at the store. I returned the next day to find it safely tucked away behind her counter. Great experience on a forgettable day.",0,5
The Home Depot,Owner of 2 Propane Tanks Now,"I went back to the store to return an empty propane tank and found out that I was stuck with it.

FedEx considered the package delivered. When I contacted Home Depot they basically said it was not their problem and I should contact my credit card company and try to cancel the charge. Home Depot made no effort at all to put things right. Let's not even mention the Home Depot website offers no easy way to contact them and I had to hunt about for an 800 number.

Home Depot now tells me that I will have to hire an electrician, at my own expense, then pay Home Depot to have the dishwasher installed, WHAT???

I went to the store and was able to cancel the online order but when I went to buy a matched washer+dryer set in the store was told they had none for sale, just displays. The salesman told me I was selfish, caring only about my problem when ""people has lost their homes to the forest fires.""

The Home Depot,What's up with the delivery guy's attitude?,"I had a new fridge delivered a few weeks ago. There were no issues with the fridge itself or timing of the delivery, all that stuff was fine. But one of the two delivery guys was a bottom-of-the-barrel individual with no respect for anything. He shouldn't be customer-facing and should stay at the warehouse.I usually try my best to avoid cantankerous people that lack the mental capacity to keep their mouth shut when circumstances deviate even slightly from the way they want them to go. Unfortunately with situations such as appliance deliveries, avoidance of this sort is generally impossible. One of the delivery guys was OK; the other looked like he just got out of prison and was looking for every possible way to avoid bringing the new fridge into the house. I am usually stumped as to how people like this ever get hired in the first place.So the worse of the two delivery guys says the new fridge is too big to get through the front door and up the stairs in a raised ranch house. The fridge is purposely made just slightly smaller than the 36"" access points so there should have been no issue. The only issue I could think of is that this delivery guy didn't want to have to struggle in the least; I am not sure what else he'd expect with the type of job he chose, which was bringing a 388lb. fridge into my house. While still outside preparing the new fridge to bring in, the worse of the two guys was complaining and cussing in such a way that he wanted me to hear him - ""people don't understand what it takes to do this *expletive*"". I suppose in his opinion, I must be too stupid to understand how tough his job is. Well he couldn't be more wrong. I get it, it's a tough job. But hey, he chose it; either deal with it or quit.After all the hemming and hawing this guy did, it literally took them 60 seconds to get that fridge through the door, up the stairs and into the kitchen. That guy stood around complaining for much longer than that and wasn't smart enough, or didn't care enough, to be out of earshot while mouthing off. All that complaining would have saved him 60 seconds at best, that's worth it!!Once the fridge was inside, the worse of the 2 delivery guys stayed outside, thankfully to not come back inside my house or be seen again. The other guy did minimal setup, claiming due to COVID, basically all he could do was plug it in and leave. They were supposed to have a ""required"" water line kit, of which he had no intention of setting that up. I didn't have any issue hooking it up myself and had planned to do it later but after they left, but I discovered they didn't leave me the new 12 foot water line I paid for. They probably never even had it.I am thankful that the delivery was on time and undamaged but I guess the ""price"" I have to pay is dealing with a substandard element of society. I will almost certainly shop with higher-end retailers in the future if I need anything delivered, maybe I’ll fare better. That's no guarantee but I'd hope there would be a lot less of the type of person I had to deal with for this delivery.",0,2

The Home Depot,Its is unfortunate that in order to…,"Its is unfortunate that in order to write a review you have to at least give 1 star. HD without a doubt one is one of the worst stores in history. After my last nightmare with them when they totally lied about the delivery of my washer causing me to have to wait 6 additional weeks after waiting 4 months and having to order it from somewhere else, I thought ok how bad can it be if I am at the store buying something, how bad can they screw it up. Let me tell you if HD went out of business tomorrow they would be doing us all a big favor. Their customer service is is non existent. It is obvious that they have no regard for their customers nor do they care. On Saturday we ordered a fire pit and paid extra to have it assembled, we waited at the customer service desk while the worker took approximately 30 minutes to write up the order because she was too busy taking calls from her friends and not concentrating on doing her job. Finally when she was done she told us it would be ready on Monday at 2:00, I called on Monday to verify and was told to be there at 5:00 instead. When we arrived and went to the customer service desk there were 3 women standing around eating, gossiping and making fun of customers walking by, like a bunch of high schoolers, seriously who does that and does that loud enough for people to hear. Fortunately a nice man in a wheelchair helped us, went and checked on our order and when he came back we were informed that it was not assembled nor would it be since the assemblers were not there on Mondays. Once again HD lied to us - seems to be the way they treat their customers is to lie to them. There is one good thing that came out of it, I got my money back from HD and went to Lowes where I found a firepit that I liked even more, they assembled it for free and right then and there and it was less money. Save yourself the aggravation go to Lowes or any other similar type store and stay away from HD, they are nothing but a bunch of crap.",0,1

The Home Depot,Do you purchase or not by picture,"We are seniors and we purchased a tarp #304342392 . Hub spread it out on the driveway and I helped put on boat. When He got it on the boat several areas you could see daylight (so he has to take a ladder and put grey tape over holes) He called and she said he had to take it off of the boat to get his money back. He explained what he put the tarp on a 20 ft. boat all day to do, senior and disabled. So she gave him credit for $5.00 on a $50 purchase. So some tarp items could be challenging like ours to take off and return. When you spread the tarp out it looks good and you can not see the thin areas where light shines through and will leak...It does have plastic grommets to hold down the tarp that was nice a good feature for a tarp.",0,2
The Home Depot,Building storage shed from scratch,My husband and I are building a storage shed and we knew that our local Home Depot would be so helpful and have all the necessary things needed to build a shed. We did not need help from employees placing the word onto the carts we didn’t need help with questions about what we needed until we got to the metal roof. So we asked a gentleman who was there and he said that he was busy but he would get the guy for us so we waited for 45 minutes and he never showed up. My husband and I got what we thought we needed and got out of there of course extremely unhappy come to find out that the J rails were to be put on step previous and if we would’ve known that we would’ve saved ourselves from Drilling into the railing so we were unable to bring two of them back and the roof vent that we thought we had was the wrong thing so we got to looking at our receipts and realized that we never paid for it it was not on a receipt and so my husband and I loaded it up took it back to the store and when they scanned it they said that that product was not even Home Depot‘s so we left it with the girl because we’re not thieves. Come to find out that if we would’ve just had somebody talk to us for a couple minutes we would’ve figured out what we needed the first time without wasting money. The joke that my husband and I have that if you’re at Home Depot watch because their employees will try to hide from you because obviously they don’t like to help anybody. I have been there and there is very few employees that are helpful and courteous the rest of them will not make eye contact with you and walk by as fast as they possibly can.

The Home Depot,"Marney Davis, Montlimar location, Mobile, al","Today, I called to confirm a Saturday delivery on an order which had been postponed several time (Aug 5 order), understandably due to covid. Fast approaching and no word except the delivery date on my home depot account on line, I was met with a woman who was beyond rude and inadequate at her job in customer service. She repeatedly asked my information (name. Phone. Order number) and never would pass me off to another more experienced customer service rep or the manager as I requested. The most insulting part was that she continued to talk over me. When I asked her to listen, she just continued rattling on, almost shouting. At one point she transferred me to a man who was even less qualified to answer any questions. He lied, at first, saying he was the manager and after repeatedly asking his name and not being given it, he said the manager was on break and call back in an hour. Then HE HUNG UP ON ME!!!! I called another HD, (schillengers rd in mobile, al.) and spoke with manager Anthony who immediately explained that, once ordered, I would need to call the manufacturers number, which he quickly provided. Next, he explained, I would be prompted for my HD order number. Simple. Anthony might have saved a customer for you. A customer, who, I might add, moved over after 25 years from Lowes! I'm willing to try HD, his, once more. However, I will never shop in the Montlimar location again unless I can be assured these clowns are on no more than stock duty.

Customer service at The Home Depot placed me on hold so that they could ""talk to their delivery company,"" then BOLDLY LIED about talking with them. When the workbench finally arrived ON THE 29TH, the logistics company informed me that no one from The Home Depot ever contacted them until THAT DAY. I paid $159.00 to have the workbench delivered to the room of choice (garage). I understand there might have been some delay due to the Holidays, but it took almost 3 weeks...not to mention AFTER Christmas. If you must purchase something, do NOT have it delivered.

I have asked an employee at the checkout area why this is and was told that they can't/won't force customers to wear a mask.

The Home Depot,This is the WORST Home Depot EVER!!,"Park City, UtahThis is the WORST Home Depot i have ever been in. First off, there are 5 people who work in customer service, including the manager, Derrick, who was standing back there and NONE of them would answer the telephone. They just let it ring and ring and ring for over an hour and a half without ever answering it. It NEVER stopped ringing. There were long lapses with no customers where the staff were just talking to each other and playing with dogs and the phone continued to ring off the hook. When i tried to rent the truck, they said someone had it out till 3:30pm and to call back then to see if it had come back. I called for an hour and a half. It just rang and rang and rang until it disconnected us. Why do you tell customers to call you when you know you never answer the phone??? Is it just to get rid of your customers? Well, you're going to get rid of them permanently. I will NEVER EVER purchase anything from any Home Depot again in this lifetime and I will be sure to let all my friends and family of the very shabby way I was treated. So the truck was supposed to be back at 3:30pm according to the contract. After waiting an hour and a half for the return, which was over due, I asked Derrick, the manager, if he would call the customer and ask if he had a new estimated return time. Obviously, I know you cant demand a customer return the truck but you can at least ask the customer when he thinks he might return it and let him know that there are other people waiting for it. Could he at least do that? No. He told a staff member to call the customer. The staff member did but didnt ask for an estimated time. The person with the truck just said, ""Ill see what I can do"". Thats not helpful. The person with the truck also lied and said he didnt puck the truck up till 2pm. We were here at 1pm and he already had the truck out. Another staff verified that yes, he had it out before 1pm. I tracked down the manager and asked if he could assist in reminding the customer that the truck was contracted until 3:30pm. He said no, as he continued to walk past me with the issue unresolved. I work retail. We have to answer the phone before the 3rd ring, even when we are checking out customers. Letting your customer service phones ring off the hook, especially when you are not busy is totally unacceptable, especially when you have 4 to 5 staff, including the manager, behind the counter the majority of the time. Its been an hour since the person with the truck was called and he still has not bothered to return the truck. No one here seems the least bit concerned that Ive been trying to get my carpet home since Wednesday and it is now Friday at 6pm. Another thing. The store is supposed to have 3 trucks. They have lost the keys for 1 truck. The 2nd truck isnt working but is sitting in theit, not getting repaired. So all of Park City and the surrounding area is left to use 1 truck, that the staff refuses to schedule. Is it really that hard to schedule a truck for a 2 or 3 hour block of time or longer if you think you need it? Its not hard. Not hard at all but Home Depot doesn't care about serving its customers. I truly think they don't care about anything at all. Just punching in and punching out. Thanks God for Lowes and that we have an alternative to this very poorley run store.",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot Inventory Management Needs Improvement,"I go to Home Depot at 12275 Price Club Plaza, Fairfax, VA 22030 quite frequently. While I can normally find things at this hardware store that I need, store management needs to properly manage and improve its inventory. More recently, I have had to go to Lowe's to get some items because this store didn't have what I needed. Among other things, I looked for liquid lawn fertilizer and weed control and found just one or two bottles available even though the on-line system stated that there were many more items on the store's shelf. I have also observed on many different occasions limited or no mulch, plants, lawn soil, etc. Customers shouldn't have to waste time driving to this or any Home Depot store expecting to find what they want by checking in advance on the official store website only to be disappointed with an out-of-stock or limited selection situation. This is a problem for me and I expect many other shoppers who go to this and other Home Depot stores that are not effectively managing the inventory, including taking old items off the shelf. I have also observed many times old items that appear to have been on this and other Home Depot store shelving to be old and dusty. Home Depot senior leadership and store management need to ensure that their inventory of lawn weed and feed items is current, well stocked and available in accordance with its on-line system.",0,2

If he is just rude or m.b. he has some personal problems? I can not find the answer of his strange behavior. M.b. it is my age of 75? Did Home Depot instructed their employees to be polite, non discriminatory in any way and try to behave in most civilize manner?",0,1
The Home Depot,Poor customer service,"After 4 calls that were hanged up (40-45 minutes waiting time), waited again more than 30 minutes on the phone to finally answered they couldn't help. I call international customer care #. They routed the call to PR even when I told them that they never helped me (that was the reason I called to the main customer service). I had visited and called uncounted times to the local stores here in Puerto Rico for the last two months and it had been really hard to received a good and proper response. Need to work with the service to the customers. Trying to buy a riding mower had been impossible on HomeDepot. This had been my preffered store for many many years. My first time giving a review, but I'm really dissapointed.",0,1
The Home Depot,We bought a Maytag washer and a…,"We bought a Maytag washer and a warranty from Home Depot about 2 years ago. It started malfunctioning about 1 month ago. We informed Home Depot and our warranty was put into effect. The warranty company told us they would call us and never did. They even stated that they were no longer the warranty company for Home Depot. We called our local Home Depot and they have not been able to help us at all either (Elk River, MN store). In the mean time we have been without a clothes washer for a month. Home Depot and whoever their warranty company is really could care less. I talked to a manager at our local store where we purchased the washer and she stated she would contact the warranty company. I asked that the local store manager call me back as well...he did not think it was important enough to care so this is why I am writing this review. If you are going to take our money for warranty coverage when we purchase a new appliance then any company of integrity would surely follow through on their promise. This has not been the case. Home Depot's house is in major disarray and nobody seems to care. We demanded a new washer replacement if they were not going to honor the warranty they sold us and, again, we have not heard back from anyone! My next step is Small Claims court. I would caution anyone purchasing an appliance from Home Depot, and, especially an extended warranty to rethink your decision. They do not stand behind the products they sell, and, are only too happy to sell useless extended warranties and take your money. The customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced, and, I will NEVER purchase another product from their store. I am telling everyone who will listen about my experience with Home Depot. I will forward this writing to the Better Business Bureau and the MN State Attorney's Office as well. Very disappointed and angry for the way we have been treated!",0,1

I was told the rest was on its way but it never showed up . After calling and calling they finally answered and I was told they would call me back . The next day they called me and said it would be 4 days before they will deliver. The really sad part is that I had a crew of men there the first day I was to get my cinder block so that we could get the job done that day . Now I have to bring another crew back to finish which because of there poor management it is costing me money but they don’t care . Will never order big quantities of materials from they again.",0,1
The Home Depot,"Ordered size M, received L, have to return at the store... Horrible experience.","Ordered two Milwaukee heated jackets in medium with batteries and chargers. Upon receiving the package I discovered that both jackets sent to me were size Large! Both jackets were brand new but the boxes with accessories were visibly used, moreover, the traditional size sticker that usually goes with all Milwaukee clothing was missing from the protective plastic bag inside the box, also, the part where the size is listed on the box wss crossed out with a black marker.I don't know what to make of this but, based on my previous shopping experience with both home Depot stores and their website, I can only assume that the jackets were returned, refurbished and then put back into wrong boxes. Tried to return the purchase but, unfortunately, no matter what, in order to return anything you purchase from them online you have to go to one of their physical, local stores! After getting nowhere online I attempted to reach them over the phone and e-mail but the experience was just as miserable as it is in one of their stores, however, despite the uselessness and/or rudeness of their customer service reps, I was able to understand that, unlike Amazon, Lowes, BedBathandBeyond or, well, literally ANT other company that sells goods online, the Home Depot clearly doesn't care about the comfort and/or wellbeing of their customers, moreover, they don't seem to know or don't care about the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic... A miserable experience, to say the least. The only mistake I made is giving the Home Depot my money but, instead of jackets, I received additional expenses! I don't drive so I have to spend close to $50 on a cab, money that the Home Depot will not pay me back. What pisses me off the most is that we are, in fact, in the middle of a deadly viral outbreak, what are they thinking? Who does this? Sends wrong items and then demands for the customer to deliver said wrong items to a store, on their own dime? After doing some research I realized that nearly all products sold by the Home Depot, sans Ryobi, can be purchased from, like, ten other places and for less money, places that do free online returns and not only when they are the ones clearly at fault but, like, all the time. It's also safe to say that I have had enough and shall never, ever buy anything else from the Home Depot ever, ever again. EVER!!!Come to think about it, they might actually be the worst company I've ever dealt with and I am not exaggerating, I mean EVERY WORD.",0,1

The Home Depot,I purchased fencing from home depot in…,"I purchased fencing from home depot in August. Told it would be delivered on September 3rd. Did not receive the delivery until September 11th and all home depot can say is sorry for the inconvenience, it was due to COVID. The store manager in their St. Charles, Missouri location, their customer care team, specifically Cierra Smith and the district manager all have the mentality that they are above sticking to their agreed upon promise of the delivery dates. If they don't deliver on time, they don't care and they do not want to hear how they have inconvenienced their customers. To them, one dissatisfied customer is small compared to the many other shoppers coming in their stores.Someone needs to do a class action law suit against them for the many, many dissatisfied customers due to their delivery delays. There customer service is extremely poor and their lack of concern with promised delivery dates is ridiculous. I will never shop at home depot again and will write as many reviews on as a many sites as I can to let everyone know how horrible their customer service is.",0,1

The item arrived with the box banged up with no outer box, and I opened the box during COVID-19 to find that the item that I bought as new had been previously opened as if used and repackaged with tape rewrapping the entire item...and in fact the remote packaging had been opened...Very disappointed. Customer service was dense and offered that even after speaking with their ""management"", they could only offer me $7.50 off. Not worth the aggravation and time to discuss. Returning the item. Will not have the item when needed. Will not be using them for anything if I can help it, and cancelling an order for counter tops.",0,1

The delivery guy said he will take pics and get a new one delivered. I did not sign and asked for the copy of delivery papers showing I did not sign, as HD told me to do if it does not work. After two weeks and three seperate calls into the 800 #, I talk to a ""resolution representative"" at HD named Joshua, would not give me his last name or any identifier. He told me that he has a copy of the signed delivery statement. I said does it have my name?, he said most people just scribble, so it doesn't exactly have my name on it. He says nothing HD can do, ""it's he said vs. she said""...........is this really happening in customer service these days. Joshua was downright rude talking over me, not listening, and after an hour of him reading the manual to me, he says, he says, ""Oh, the lights are just out, but it's working, its not HD's responsibility. I have a contracting business where we spend about $300K a year at HD.....not anymore. If anyone at HD in management cares, and this would be a good story if resolved, but after 4 calls to the customer service dept., I seriously doubt it.

The store showed they had 23 boxes @ $19.97/ box. This matched the best prices I saw online so away I went. They had the screws but they were priced about 20% more than their site advertised ($24.97/box). So I asked the clerk about it as I went to checkout and she said that the store doesn't honor online pricing. It was her stores website that I got the price from and the quantity they had in stock. I don't know what they call this, I call it bait and switch. It used to be and probably still is illegal. More importantly I find it extremely disappointing that they treat me, a loyal customer for years, in this manner. I didn't have to buy it, but I did. Left though with a feeling I had just been screwed.",0,1
The Home Depot,A Lemon and Won't Refund Credit Card,"This product arrived broken, a LEMON, a Nature’s solar generator. I ordered this online, and went out of town. My understanding was that Home Depot had 90-day return policy. I didn't know that this specific product has only a 30-day return policy. Due to CV-19, my return home got delayed. So, I asked my husband to open the box. The product DID NOT WORK, a lemon. So, my husband went to Home Depot, to return it. Home Depot at first refused to return it, because it was about 36 days after online purchase or delivery. Finally, the HD manager agreed to give my husband a $2163.92 gift card. But, the card could only be used at that, ONE store location. After many calls to Home Depot, we were finally able to get them to give us online store credit. But, we simply wanted our credit card re-credited. But, HOME DEPOT CONTINUES TO REFUSE TO PUT THE RETURN BACK ON OUR CREDIT CARD, OF THEIR LEMON PRODUCT. I called again and spoke to Home Depot Resolutions, today. They STILL REFUSE TO REFUND OUR CREDIT CARD. If it were $100., I could accept this. But, it's $2163.92! And, we will not risk buying another one of these potentially, lemon generators from Home Depot. And, we don't have $2163.92 worth of other products to buy at HD. Ironically, at HD, they had limited hours due to CV-19. Yet, HD is not understanding to customers, regarding CV-19, nor when they are simply trying to get a refund to their credit card on a product that is faulty, a lemon.",0,1
The Home Depot,"How not to get warranty help from home depot, 101.","~10-17-19 I bought a $1000 new, floor model GE dishwasher, with extended warranty at home depot. I didn’t know it was a 2016 model. The unit worked for about 3 months and then stopped draining out the water on 12-23-19. The first repair company was out five times. The last time he said, I don't know what to do I have changed all the boards and cards, I am going to ask my manager if we can just replace the dishwasher. He also asked me to call at the end of the week and ask them to replace it. I called and the manager didn't know anything about it. He advised me to contact GE service. I called GE and she changed the repair company on ~6-20-20. The second repair company was out three times and once again changed the cards and was waiting for the circuit board to arrive so it could be changed again. It is now nearly October and I am getting, please renew your warranty emails, because it has been nearly a year. We never received any paperwork from any of the repair people that came to the house. So, I have nothing except about 25 emails like ""Here's how to get more help"" and ""please rate our performance"". Once the GE lady started helping me, I thought she would be the one to fix this, but she didn't and the person that she pawned me off on wanted to start this nightmare all over again. It’s now 9-22-20 and I am considering hiring a lawyer to help me.",0,1
The Home Depot,I love it,"I see many customers reviewed the store as bad. That is the case where I am going against the public opinion of majority. I don't know company in the US with better customer service than Home Depot. Of course, there are some disadvantages. There are bad and sometimes even rude employees (mostly novices). However most of my visits to this store were more than great. No problems with returns, no problems with parking, no problems with restrooms, no problems with variety of tools available. Again, there are some disadvantages, but let's compare it with other stores. Lowes is overpriced, Walmart is persecuting its own customers (e. g. Walmart blocked my account without reasonable explanation), ACE is harassing customers just because of parking. Home Depot is the store I really love. Among competitors, it is the best. I wish the best to this company.",0,5
The Home Depot,Almost 6 weeks ago,"Almost 6 weeks ago, I ordered a dishwasher to be delivered and installed. I was given an install date. I took the day off work, since you have to be home for it. 3 hours before my delivery window, I received an email saying install had been delayed. Bothersome, but not the end of the world. They schedule another date, via voicemail. I take ANOTHER day off. The delivery window comes and goes, I call and they tell me that they don't know what I'm talking about, that they don't have an appointment scheduled for me. Now, I'm ticked. I get on the phone with Home Depot corporate, they're super apologetic and assure me that they will get it installed and compensate me for the second day of work I lost. They schedule a THIRD install date. The installers arrive and at first, they don't want to install it, saying that the electrical outlet at the back of the dishwasher area is dangerous ( WTH?!). I tell them I'm happy to turn off the breaker, but I need the dishwasher. They refuse. I said fine, bring the dishwasher inside please, I'll do it myself. They refuse to do this as well, so I directed them to get their supervisor on the phone. 25 minutes later, the installers finally take the dishwasher off of the truck and tell me that it's damaged and oh, so sorry, we didn't notice. Um, buddy, the door is practically bent in half. Obviously, they dropped it and didn't want to cop to it. Another day wasted. I call the woman who assured me that I would be compensated for my time and request a refund, because I don't want to wait another 6 weeks for a dishwasher, return is processed and then she tells me that there will be no compensation, because I returned the item. Now, they're telling me that my purchase won't be refunded until the manufacturer receives the damaged item. I have been on hold for AN HOUR AND A HALF trying to get this resolved, with no end in sight. This in addition to the three days of my time that The Home Depot has already wasted. I am beyond furious at the way this company treats their customers. They should all be embarrassed at the way they treat their customers and consumers should take their business elsewhere.",0,1

The Home Depot,"More pain, No gain: Home depot’s standard for their customers","I wish I could give them negative stars. Being a female, it’s a shame to see another female being downright rude to you, apart from being unprofessional, and empathetic, unknowledgeable. If this would be a case of a return or a fault on my side, I would still understand. I usually do not like to complain about customer service representatives as I am aware that their jobs are difficult and having work as a customer service agent myself, I know that It can be challenging having to constantly listen to complaints. It also means that you get to help and resolve issues of day-to-day customer issues who are helpless and at the mercy of your knowledge and empathy. Home Depot sent me a bathtub instead of a sink, a kitchen sink. I was shocked to see that Giant tub sitting outside my garage, blocking my driveway and (worse!) delivered by nonstop delivery service, an equivalent of a bad company as Home Depot. They sent me a wrong product instead of a kitchen sink. I immediately called the agent and asked to resolve this as it was blocking my driveway. Instead of helping me out, she chose to just put me on hold and make an excuse of contacting someone and never got back. I contacted another agent, another female picked up and similarly should refuse to help me out by saying that these things happen. And the streak continues. I called next one called Ashley. She started off as someone who had frustrations herself and the minute I told her that I have been given no resolution she just stop talking to me. I kept asking if she is there and she just stop talking! It is both saddening and frustrating that women don’t help out another women. It is also saddening that after being thousand dollar for a kitchen sink you’re still at the mercy of a customer service agent who is supposed to help you get out of the mess created by their company. Instead they’re leaving a big mess for you and not prepared to do anything about it. This was my first Time buying this big of an item from Home Depot and will be the last. Neither will I buy Nor would I recommend someone to shop for anything from Home Depot online.Was i aware that home depot has an anti feminist culture? No. Now that I do, it only sets tone as what kind of culture they really have! I guess home depot truly Believes in “More pain, No gain”",0,1
The Home Depot,"Home Depot Video Doorbell Bait N' Switch, What A Stress and Waste Of Time","Three days ago, my family needed a video doorbell for our home security. We saw the product Secur360 Video Doorbell on their website. 17 in stock at the Texas Grand Prairie South location.3 in stock at the Texas Mansfeld location.3 in stock at the Texas Arlington location.5 in stock at the Texas Cedar Hill location.I purchased one at the South Grand Prairie because their website said they had 17. When I got there there was only one and the package was open. I bought it anyway and as I installed it I found out the ""Power Module"" was not with the package. The next day I went to another store that I was told had 4 of them in South Arlington. Their website said they had 3 in stock at Arlington. When I arrived there they had ""0"". I returned the incomplete Secur360 Doorbell and went to the Mansfield, Texas Home Depot that said they had some in stock. Customer Service Order Pick Up said they had it but they could not find it. They said the guy in this department could find it for me.. He said he knew the product and was going to buy one for himself that evening. He said it was on a ""Wing Display"". As soon as the guy saw there was not any in the doorbell section he left to go ""check on something"". He came back again and said he was still looking. I decided to see if it was at the end of the aisle; nothing. There was the guy yapping with another Home Depot employee both on their cell phones doing a whole lot of talkin'. The guy said I need to go check another place. I waited as I saw him walk down a ways and then he finally came back and then he said he didn't know where they were. This was a complete waist of time. And there was no offer to find it anywhere else. They had 3 listed but now they say they have none in stock. What a remarkable coincidence.So I left and went to the Cedar Hill location where ""5 in stock at Cedar Hill."" is advertised on their website. There was nothing there. I went to the front where they checked in the cage of their most shoplifted items are and they said it must be on the truck. I said why would you then advertise it as being in the store? They then said it must be on the top shelf. They began to look up there and then another cashier with fluorescent green mohawk colored hair employee with psychodelic white glasses came over and said to the other two employess ""if you can't find it it ain't here."" They stopped looking. I said thanks alot.Don't waist your time with the ill-quality and disheveled attitude of what most customers regard as a ""Best Seller"" video Doorbell from Secur360 at Home Depot.I say its the old Bait N' Switch for the more expensive Google Nest and Ring Video Doorbells.

I was told when I moved to call and since I paid for installation they would come and hook it up at my new place apparently that was a lie now I have new appliances that I cant install myself and don't know how to. they manager at the store said he doesn't know who told me that and they couldn't do anything. I was transferred and hung up on over 4 times before I even got to him and he was no help and didn't care.

The Home Depot,MISERABLE shipping experience,"MISERABLE shipping experience. My (50$) package got lost in the UPS system. The only reason I caught this was because I constantly monitored the shipping - Home Depot just stopped communicating. For DAYS I attempted to get in contact with Home Depot to fix this - all their phones led to a computer, not a person. They do not have an email or Fax #. I attempted to contact them via Facebook messenger, and the two associates were very unhelpful. They basically pinned the fault on UPS and said they couldn't do anything on their end. Finally I ended up calling the local Home Depot store just so I could talk to an actual person! She was unable to reach UPS and we are now trying to contact the direct supplier (no answer yet). Its been almost 10 days since my package was supposed to get here, and the only reason anything is moving foreword is because I've been calling every number imaginable. Communication is TERRIBLE.

You are probably only here because you have had a bad experience with Home Depot. Well, after spending over $50K with this company on a remodel in the last three years, at least I can say that I feel your pain. No reliability with basic customer service. No reliability with stock counts online. No reliability with large materials orders placed. No reliability with rebate promotions. No reliability with getting a store manager involved to assure what is promised will happen. No reliability with filing a written complaint with the store or at the cooperate level. The only reason Home Depot is still in business is because they are so big and have pushed out so many smaller neighborhood stores, that none of us really have a choice. They don't have to care about customer satisfaction.All I can suggest is expect the worst and maybe you might be surprised when Home Depot actually comes though...",0,1

The idiot contractor never picked up the parts never showed up to install never called to reschedule. Everything has been paid for a month ago and no work has been done the screen door still sitting on the back patio and Home Depot can’t figure out what to do!!!!!!!!!!! That’s just because no one’s in charge over there no one cares no one knows what they’re doing no one is a professional and you’re at the mercy of all those horrible contractors they farm out.

The lady flat out rolled her eyes then dramatically goes “they’re right here” and as my mom started to say that wasn’t what she was looking for the lady ignored her and walked away. There were two male employees right next to us who saw the whole thing and neither of them offered to help or apologised on that lady’s behalf. Never going there again that was so awkward and rude and that lady should be fired immediately,0,1
The Home Depot,Bad online delivery and customer…,"Bad online delivery and customer service.Online order scheduled to arrive Monday Sept 14th. On the 11th I get a call from a driver that he has my order now in front of the door. We were away for the weekend, he said he will take it back and some one will contact me to reschedule. Surely some one did and rescheduled for the 14th as it was supposed to be. No delivery done on Monday. After a 30 min wait on the phone to speak to Customer service, they said they opened a ticket and now I have to wait 3-4 days for some one to call you to schedule a new date. I complained that’s not acceptable. He said he will transfer me to a resolution specialist or supervisor which turned out to be to a dead extension with no one there and no space to leave messages. The whole conversation and wait time took about 1 hour.Called again, after 45 min wait, I was transferred to online resolution specialist who told me there is nothing to do since that’s the process because I missed the first delivery (seriously?) And the first person who rescheduled last Friday didn’t open a ticket, and the “Process” to get a reschedule call is and I quote is that I have to call first and complaint and open a ticket then I get another reschedule call. And yes that might take a couple of days. So basically Home depot delivered on the wrong date, didn’t do a proper reschedule. The fact that I bought something and it's pending delivery doesn't prompt HD to try to deliver it on the right date on their own or even follow up. And the end result is the customer has to wait to hear back sometime in the next few days to reschedule and who knows when that delivery window will be. When I complained again this is not acceptable, I was transferred to the same dead extension. Another hour wasted. How can you even call this a process?I shop alot at Home Depot and i got Pro Xtra so i am a loyal HD customer. Usually I shop at the store or pickup my online purchase from the store and it's fine. This is my home delivery experience with HD and both were just as Bad. Please read the reviews posted about you on Social media and actually do something about them.",0,1

Customer service indicated that they couldn’t change the delivery status, even though I can’t even retrieve the items until the 24th of September from the store, saying that my items are already shipped. 🤔 Then advised that I could cancel my order, then reorder again, then wait for the other charge to drop off/be re-credited to my account...basically being charged twice in the meantime...leaving me at an inconvenience to go and get them!!!Home Depot has commercials running every time I change the channel, but yet, their service is extremely deplorable. Maybe instead of paying for back to back advertising more money can go back into the business for mass organizational training and the revamping of certain procedures!!!!!I will NOT shop here again, and I will not dare get anything else from them, even if it were free!!

The Home Depot,Disillusioned Renovator in IN,"I recently purchased a home and am replacing the flooring throughout - just over 2,000 usable SF. After A LOT of shopping around, I decided on Home Depot for their installation services, product selection, and moderate quality and prices. Now that I am one this side of it, with my flooring half installed (self-i stalling with material from a DIFFERENT retailer), dealing with Home Depot has been the biggest speed bump and regret to my remodeling process. I’ve given them $60 essentially for wasting my time, and am now 2 weeks behind my move-in schedule. I was a serious potential customer, and spent $40 on the samples and $20 on the measuring deposit. Arguably a justifiable expense, and I wouldn’t be so annoyed about it if they hadn’t wasted over 2+ hours of my time to get the quote figured out. I tried to do it over the phone, and their call-in costumer service was next to useless. I was told I would have to go to a physical store to get a quote. So I went to the closest store - 30 min away - in a pandemic, and sat for 2 hours as the person went back and forth on the phone with the same people at the call center I had tried to work with, Then the quote finally came - $18,000.... and the material I picked has a SF cost of $1.19...It was the most absurd thing I have ever seen. The quote was also almost entirely time and materials - the demo was ‘free’ except for a couple small areas of tile. They reran the quote for a different flooring product, and it still came back almost double what it should have been, in my opinion. Now I’m halfway through my flooring project, I can see it will take around 120 man hours to do everything start to finish. Using their labor total, it works out to $75/hour (per worker, per hour) in labor costs. Since a flooring installer makes $20-25 and hour plus maybe $5/hour in overhead costs (assuming Home Depot provides their installers healthcare coverage, etc), that is an enormous amount of profit going to HD just for the labor. And arguable that number is actually even higher because a practiced crew could work faster and more efficiently than a group of amateur DIYers.So to summarize, the core of my issue is that Home Depot seems to WAY overvalue their time, and they are, in practice, ascribing negative value to my time that they wasted several hours of. They also do not seem to value to my money either, since my negative experience led me to purchase all the materials and equipment from different companies. After this experience, I am very disillusioned with Home Depot as a company, and will now actively avoid shopping there.",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot Never Again,"Please don’t make the same mistakes I did By expecting good service from Home Depot. I purchased a GE $4000 microwave wall oven combination From Home Depot on 8400 Westheimer In Houston, Texas. I bought the oven as well as installation and delivery and haul away. Delivery went fine and the delivery service told me that the installers would be hauling The old oven away. The installers came and the install went fine until They had completed it and then refused to haul the old oven away because they said they didn’t do that. After arguing with me for a while They finally agreed to haul it away. After they had left my wife and I noticed that the oven door was setting a quarter inch to the side of the oven. I called customer service and they agreed to replace the oven. When they delivered the new oven to my house the delivery service told me that the installers would be hauling it away. When the installers got here they said they would not be hauling it away And that I would have to call the store to get it hauled away. After they left I called customer service at Home Depot and they agreed that it should’ve been done differently and will pick up the oven on the following Saturday. Today is Saturday and no one showed up to pick up the oven and I was even told two hours before the end of the day that I was still on the list for the pickup. I now have an oven sitting in my living room and who knows when it will be picked up. I wanted to buy a refrigerator and a dishwasher from Home Depot for my next purchases. I will not be doing that now nor buying anything else from Home Depot. Folks Save yourself a whole lot of aggravation and don’t shop at Home Depot.

The Home Depot,Terrible service,"This review is for the bad service of the delivery company named Tibco(?) (crap) and Home Depot. My delivery and install was scheduled today at 1:30PM to 5:30PM. The delivery dummies arrived at 12:50PM, 40 minutes early. I was not home at the time, but one adult was home. The adult at home told him I was at the store and that I would be back soon. The delivery guy left shortly after and didn't wait for me to arrive. He left well before the scheduled 1:30PM. The adult at the house told him he could call me, but the delivery guy told him not to call me and that he would call his boss. I didn't receive the delivery guys calls because it was marked as ""spam caller"" by my phone. Anyways, this wouldn't have been an issue if they would have come at their scheduled time!!! If they needed a longer delivery window, they should have told me to be available from 8AM to 5PM and I would have been there! I tried calling the delivery company (which was a pain to get to a human) and then escalated to the ""manager"", but she was no help at ALL! They couldn't come back to my home because they were on to the next delivery. I asked, why they came early...they said, ""Oh maybe they finished early on their previous delivery"". I was like... if they are early, why can't they circle back to my house and at least drop the product off (without installation). Zero help. Next, I called Home Depot ""complaint"" department and they were nice but were not able to get my product delivered today or the next day. The next available delivery date was a next week! Terrible service by the delivery company ""Tibco"" and bad on Home Depot for hiring them. I returned the product and will be buying it elsewhere. Thanks Home Depot and Tibco!",0,1

The Home Depot,I am very disappointed with Home depot…,I am very disappointed with Home depot today i have been coming here past 3 years and have written positive reviews in the past. The associate Yolanda was on self check out made my wife and i feel very uncomfortable. As i was was approaching to check out there were two other customers checking out their items. She did not over watch them or screen them in any way they were able to enjoy the comfort of checking themselves out but i did not receive the same courtesy. She immediately came to us and went through my cart pulling apart the crates and asking if i counted and checked things out then did it again when i requested a military discount. I understand that not everyone is honest and may use self check out to take things but i have integrity and she did not do the same with everyone i felt singled out and felt very uncomfortable with the manner in which she did it. Lowes is closer to my home i honestly just enjoy Home Depot alot more more i really hope someone can speak with her or just not have her there. I trust this can hopefully be resolved so that customers dont have to feel like this again.,0,1
The Home Depot,Very Poor Company Policy on paid cash to get cash refund!!!!!,"We bought a refrigerator and on the day that it was delivered it turned out that the refrigerator had been damaged, the delivery company said we would get a call back within 2 hours to let us know when we would get the new refrigerator, never received a call and it is a week later, the very next day, we called Saturday morning only to be told they couldn’t help us and for us to call back on Tuesday, went to our Home Depot where we paid cash for the refrigerator this same Saturday. We kinda got some answers but they would need to check and call me back on Tuesday, Tuesday came and went. Went to the store yesterday and was informed that it looks like it will be delivered on the 17th. Yesterday while I was out and about I found a refrigerator that we were originally wanted and to be honest we also are saving money! We went to our Home Depot store yesterday to cancel the refrigerator and get our cash refund back, after all we paid cash ( keep in mind delivery on the 17th was going to be confirmed on Monday the 14th.) We were then told that we have to wait 24 hours to get our cash refund and we were told this a few times 24 hours!!!! When I asked why was told it’s company policy and that they don’t also kept that kind of cash available for refunds.I placed a call to corporate and spoke to a guy named Chedder, during my conversation with Chedder and I wasn’t agreeing to what he was saying, I then asked to speak to a supervisor, Chedder absolutely refused to transfer me to Supervisor, he transferred me to a Appliance Specialist. I explained all of this to this person. He was very friendly and very helpful!!!!I had another appointment that I needed to get to, so we agreed that I would call back after this appointment. I placed a call back after my meeting around 3:30pm. I wasn’t able to reach him, but the 2nd rep I spoke to looked at the case notes and said that everything was completed and that I could go back to the store to get my cash refund, we just arrived at the store when we were told this. Went into our Homedepot store and explained the conversation I just completed. We had to wait over 20 mins for someone to get back to us after reading the case notes. Seemed very much like we were being made to wait on purpose! We left to go pay for the other refrigerator! Meanwhile while in route to the other refrigerator, I placed another call to corporate and re-got the first original appliance specialist and explained everything to this point. He himself was very shocked at how this were being handled by our HomeDepot store! He was showing everything had been canceled after all he made the callers to the vender and the delivery company!After waiting for him to complete his re-research, it turns out that Home Depot install new software a couple of days ago that keeps from getting your cash refund for 24 hours. This is extremely poor customer service, a software system that stops you from getting your cash refund cause the system is still in pending status and every human involved to this point knows that it has been canceled and the new software doesn’t allow overrides!Placed call today to see when I would be able to pick up my cash refund from our store were we paid cash!!! Was informed that it would be sometime today! That the system is still showing pending cancellation!! That the store manager will be checking periodically for the completion. I explained that we have been told all along that we had to wait 24 hours both by corporate and our Home Depot store, I was then informed it’s 24 to 48 hours!!!! I joke you not! Never in all the conversations yesterday did I ever hear corporate or our store location mention 24 to 48 hours. They have all along this whole time have said 24 hours. I explained this to whom I was talking to at the store location. I also explained that I canceled the order that I haven’t received nor is it in transit to us, that I canceled the order yesterday at 1:50 pm time stamp by their paperwork and that 24 hours would be 1:50 today!! I told the caller I would be calling back at the 24 hour mark!Ohhh btw after sharing my story with others !!! Found out that this is happening a lot!!!",0,1

No one answers the store phone no. You can choose all the options the message provides, but no one answers the phone. Your 1-844-770-5328 no. is equally bad. I had ordered closet doors in July, and I was trying to find out the status. I understand the delays due to COVID-19, but not answering the phone is not an excuse for staff working at Terminal Avenue. This is not the first time that I had to do this. Finally, I had to call the Cambie Store, one of the staff there picked up the phone in less than 3 rings. Your management needs to advise the staff on Terminal Avenue about the importance of answering the phone. Someone in the store should be responsible for informing your customers about the status of the order. In the future, I would rather go to the Cambie store to get better customer service.

The Home Depot,I ordered a upright freezer and it was…,I ordered a upright freezer and it was scheduled to be delivered 09/08/20 between 7:30am and 11:30am. It is now after 9pm and I still haven’t received my freezer. This is such a inconvenience because I planned my day for this. As a paying customer I shouldn’t have to guess when my delivery will appear. I expect to receive what I ordered the day and between times Home Depot gave me. Customer service is impossible to contact. I want to speak to a person not a recording. I will definitely not purchase anything else from Home Depot. I’m very disappointed in the lack of communication and lies.,0,1
The Home Depot,Once again Home Depot steals defeat…,Once again Home Depot steals defeat from the jaws of victory. We placed an on line order and were told delivery would be two weeks. We attempted to find out why but after talking to 3 idgits decided to wait to see if the order showed up. It did not. We called about order status. We were told it was delivered. It was not. We were told to call the store from which the order was to be delivered. We were told its coming but we don't know when. You would think I would learn from experience Home Depot is horrible and now I order from Lowes. Perhaps I'll learn this time. Do not order from Home Depot on line. Its a never ending rabbit hole.,0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot  curbside service what a joke,"Home Depot offers curbside service but unfortunately their website won't allow you to put that information in at the end. This is the third time I've tried to use this service and it doesn't work the website doesn't work about 75% of the time and then when you go into the store you have to do self checkout anyway,so why even bother opening your doors if you don't want to serve your customers.",0,1

They are very consistent. Took my 20 calls to even talk to anybody at home Depot.",0,1

The Home Depot,I seldom write reviews and I believe in…,I seldom write reviews and I believe in being fair to companies and not embellishing bad experiences but my recent experience with The Home Depot has been simply terrible. We have a fridge that needs replacing as the repair man says it is beyond repair. We placed our order at the home depot in May and waited 2.5 months for delivery despite them saying it was in stock and always reassuring us the delivery was only a week or two away. I think the pandemic was to blame here. But when the delivery finally came the delivery man said he could not drive down or driveway since a few tree branches would touch his truck and this is not allowed per the home depot. We reassured him that larger and taller trucks have driven here without a problem many times but he said it was store policy. We then tried to arrange for the Home Depot to deliver in a smaller truck but they said that they were unwilling. We spent hours and hours on the phone with the home depot customer service and they were increasingly rude and arbitrary. It's simply hard to understand how they aren't able to deliver a fridge in perfectly good weather with a perfectly good driveway. They simply didn't care and were rude to boot.,0,1
The Home Depot,Ordered appliances 2 months ago which…,"Ordered appliances 2 months ago which were apparently on back order. Our salesman Matt was great & was very helpful. After 2 months of waiting finally the merchandise was about to deliver. According to the policy we were expecting a call a day before delivery & were told about 30 minutes prior to delivery. No call a day before, 5 mins notice before delivery. Was at work & made arrangements for my neighbor to be at home. No show, no call. Extremely inconvenience as half of the stuff from refrigerator went bad. Ended up throwing most of it. Second delivery scheduled after 2 weeks. Finally gave 39 min window before coming. Just plugged the appliances & left. 2 boxes with dishwasher & microwave weren’t opened & left in the garage without me inspecting it. All the packaging inside & out in refrigerator & stove was left. Definitely wouldn’t recommend Home Depot with poor service",0,1
The Home Depot,TERRIBLE CURBSIDE SERVICE AT UNIONTOWN HOME DEPOT!,"My wife and I are over 70 years old and because of the Covid-19 virus we avoid crowds and don’t shop anywhere that we can’t get curbside service. Yesterday I ordered and paid for some items online from the Uniontown, PA Home Depot and designated that I wanted curbside pickup. I waited for their text message advising me that the order was ready to be picked up. Drove to their store and parked in the stall designated for curbside pickup. I notified Home Depot as directed by the huge sign in the stall where I parked. No one came out with the products that I purchased. I notified them 2 more times... no one came out! After waiting 20 minutes I went in the store. I assumed that they were swamped with customers, but when I arrived at the customer service desk there were two girls there and no customers. I asked them why they didn’t bring out my order! They stated that the Home Depot curbside notification system wasn’t working!!! I didn’t believe them because without asking me for my name or order number, they just looked at the computer and went and brought out my order so I asked to speak to the store manager. She was sitting at a desk in the same customer service area. I asked her why she didn’t put a sign outside in the curbside pickup area stating that their curbside notification didn’t work instead of letting me waste my gasoline for 20 minutes and then have to come into their store and be exposed to whomever was in the store at the time! All I got was a blank stare! Terrible to non-existent customer service at the Uniontown Home Depot! Won’t be shopping there anymore!",0,1
The Home Depot,Veteran disrespected,"I have been shopping at this Home Depot at Edgewood for five years as an African American veteran and have received nothing but the utmost professional service from all of the representatives there except for today. Purchasing a small item I went to the self-check area and waited for the representative whose name is Maria to finish talking with a customer. As a Veteran, it is best to let the cashier or sales rep know in advance that you are a Vet and be prepared to show them your identification in order to get the percentage discount, which I always use when shopping at Home Depot in-person. (You cannot receive a discount if shopping online). Once Maria was finished the customer since I was standing in front of her with my wallet in hand with ID to show, I expected to let her know I was a Vet and needed assistance. When approaching a cashier, I let them know I'm a Vet, they ask to see my ID which I always have ready and they make an adjustment in the cash register and usually show me what my discount is. Then a Caucasian male approached her and abruptly she serviced him and explained he could use any register that was available. At this point I immediately felt disrespected because I was respectfully standing there waiting my turn. I then caught her eye and mentioned that I was a Vet and get a Veterans discount showing her my ID. Maria then states ""bring it here let me see it"" Her tone and mannerism was rude, arrogant and acted like I was lying about my ID. I asked her if she was going to make the adjustment so I could get my discount? she said ""just scan it and someone will help you"" Then she walked away saying nothing else. If I would have continued with my sale to checkout, the discount would not have been calculated without the cashier's entry. I waited for her to come back and realized she was not, and communicated with another cashier who I often work with. I explained to her that Maria told me to scan my item and someone would assist and the cashier said that is not the way it is handled and made her entry. Long story short, if this is how Maria will treat customers of color, she does not need to work at Home Depot or any other customer service entity. When I got home to make sure I had Maria's name correct, I called and was able to speak with Manager Bryan who agreed that was not the process for a Veterans Discount, apologized and his apology was accepted.",0,2

In my eyes Home Depot with the vendor because Home Depot issue I paid not the vendor. So that was not acceptable to me. The second option was I would actually have to purchase and pay for a second grill. They would arrange a delivery of a time I was totally unaware of. The grill is currently in an enclosed garage which I asked the UPS man to place in because I couldn’t pick up the box it was so heavy to bring it from the outside environment into an enclosed The customer service so-called wrap and actually the supervisor as well during a three-way conversation tell me to put the box outside and cover it. Indeed, how would I have done that since I can’t even pick up the box, should I cover it with a queen size comforter? Never order from Home Depot go to Lowe’s go to wherever you have to go to but stay away from Home Depot. I actually found the same grill on Amazon for $200 cheaper can you imagine that? I immediately purchased it. I tried to cancel the remaining items on my order that would associate it’s just a cover that would fit the grill I ordered, and multiple other accessories. I told him to cancel the entire order I did not want to deal with them any further. The response I got was I can’t cancel the order I have to return the items I don’t want. I currently in the solo caregiver of a paraplegic sister I can’t leave the house but did they care, the answer to that would be no they did not care.

The Home Depot,Store number 4737 located in Covington,"Store number 4737 located in Covington, WA. has one of the worst Contractors Service I have ever experienced. I was lied to by one of the cashier stating only phone sales are processed in Contractor Sales.

Lots of customers and a few employees working with NO MASKS. Home Depot is the place to go if you would like a nice case of Covid 19. They are a disgusting bunch of nitwits and before people talk.

The Home Depot,No Masks at Home Depot,"My husband just returned from the Home Depot in the Forum Center of Fort Myers.

The Home Depot,I thought after 10 years,"I thought after 10 years, that Home Depot would have resolved their installation issues. The company lures you in with great deals and employees make lots of claims of ease of installment. Then the delivery and installation occur and Home Depot refuses, yet again, to stand behind their installation. Not only that, but they also refuse to give you the contact information of the install company to try and get the problem resolved. I knew I should not have ordered through them, but I did again...after all, it has been 10 years and still the same issue. Do not trust any delivery and install as Home Depot does not stand behind the 3rd party companies and their customer service rep supervisors (I had to escalate the matter) are unhelpful.

When someone came for the ""final"" cleanup and installing the caps that cover the screws on the windowsills, they are the wrong caps. Three weeks later, still no caps.

The woman from home depot online that I spoke with, at length after a 12 hour workday, assured me that she would expedite the order and send me an email. Fast forward 4 days. still without an email, I call again. After the requisite 4-5 disconnections that happened every single time I called the ""service"", I speak to another woman who states that the package has not been picked up by the carrier and she has no idea why my order was not fulfilled. 24 days after I ordered and paid in full for my order it still hasn't even shipped, despite emails telling me it has and is on it's way. I then tell the woman to cancel my order and she states that it's beyond the window to cancel the order. I told her to cancel the order and that the service i received was ridiculous.

The Home Depot,Damaged goods and possible fraud,"Ordered a refrigerator, stove and dishwasher. Had to wait almost a month to get it delivered. Upon delivery we had to refuse the stove due to a huge dent, we also had to refuse the dishwasher. Not only did the dishwasher have a huge dent like the stove but it was missing parts. The delivery man said they are known to pack refurbished merchandise as new. We called the next day and they said it would be over a month before they could get the new appliances to us. My husband told them never mind just refund our money and we will go elsewhere. It has been 8 days and we still do not have our money. The first time my husband called them they hung up on him when he asked where his money was. Then he finally got someone and they said we would have it tomorrow or the next day. Now that its been 3 days later, they claim there is a glitch in the cloud. There was no glitch when they took over $5000. Now they claim it will take another 3 to 5 days. I guess we are going to have to contact the attorney general and file a fraud case. This is unacceptable. Don't ever buy from them unless you want damaged appliances or someone to take your money.",0,1
The Home Depot,placed an order through the pro desk,"placed an order through the pro desk. A small thing but we needed it badly. For the most part the employees were acceptable and sometimes even kind and uderstanding, However the item was ordered on August 24 qnd the original confirmation said it would arrive on August 28th. I made arrangements to pick it up. When I checked tracking the arrival had been changed until Sept 1st. Made arrangements again and when I called the store I was told that it would be here ""that day"" and they promised to call me ""one way or another"". No phone call ever came. On the second I must have called the store three times. Again promises to call me ""one way or another"" but no return call. Tracking says it is on the truck and ""out for delivery"". This time I spoke with a manager to see if by chance it had arrived. A very nice man who promised it would be there by 9:00 pm. and that he would call me one way or another. No call came but a computer message saying that the original date for delivery was September 1st. Wrong and I can prove it. They said it would arrive today (Sept. 2nd). When I checked tracking again (the 3rd) it says it is still on the truck sitting in New Castle....same as it said yesterday morning...and was ""out for delivery"". ...but at almost 11:00 am it still isn't here. This time I called pro service at corporate(?) and they promised to refund me $150 for my ""inconvenience"" but said I would have to contact the store to have it sent directly here. After sitting on hold, which I expected, Pam the Manager at the store picked up and said I would have to pay $79 more to have it shipped here. She was unpleasant to put it nicely (by the way I wasn't exactly kind myself) and refused to do anything but offered to cancel the order. I have had employees waiting three days with promises from the store that ""it was coming today"" and no return calls I am supposed to give them $79 to send it here! In fact she said that it wasn't her problem. And that it was up to me if I wanted to stop using Home Depot or cancel. She really didn't seem to care one way or another. She even blamed me for having trucks and people ready to pick up the cart, then she blamed FedX and Covid. It is interesting that I placed 3 other orders with different companies on the 24Th and all arrived with no problems. I understand that Covid has slowed things down BUT if other companies can get things delivered why can't Home Depot? And secondly don't make promises to call and not do so or promise that it will arrive before the store closes and not keep the promise made to call if it didn't arrive. I have built two houses and used Home Depot. All I asked is that the store ship it here when it finally arrives and not blame me for making arrangements for it to be picked up. So I will never again use Home Depot. You are loosing a builder because of $79, unkempt promises, and a difficult manager.",0,1
The Home Depot,2 months and still waiting for delivery.,"On July third I ordered a 4-piece washer dryer set with pedestal sidekick washer, which included install and haul away of my old appliances. I was to take delivery of this purchase on July 29th; however when the delivery driver unpacked the washer it was visibly damaged, so I could not accept delivery of the washer. I did receive the other 3 components, the dryer was installed; the pedestal washer was left in my garage. After spending over 60 minutes on the phone we were finally able to reschedule delivery of the new washer to September 3rd.September 3rd the delivery driver arrives at 9:15am and proceeds to unload the washer. As he’s rolling it up to the house, I ask him if he’s got the hoses he needs to install as well, to which he tells me he’s just “dropping off” he wasn’t prepared to install anything. I explained that dropping off the washer wasn’t what I needed; I paid for install and take-away of old appliances. He refused to perform these additional tasks, so I was forced to refuse delivery.Now I have rescheduled this delivery & installation again for the third time. I’m not certain why this has gone on as long as it has; but I’m not hopeful that it will be resolved in the near future. Fingers crossed that when they return on the 11th, they’re prepared and capable of accomplishing this difficult task.WG10851803",0,1
The Home Depot,Great service!,I went to Home Depot in Maple Heights to purchase replacement wood for my deck. The associate working in the area name Mark was very knowledgeable in helping me to pick out what was needed and cut several pieces of wood to size.

The Home Depot,Many appliance deliveries running late,"We ordered a refrigerator and a dishwasher about a month ago with an in store employee and set up our delivery date accordingly. Scheduled date was last Saturday - we waited all day and the truck never came. We got a call after the window of time passed that it needed to be rescheduled. The woman (very nice) told us the driver had called us, we hadn't answered and had left a message. Said our appliances were on the truck but the driver turned around. We had no calls and no messages. None. We rescheduled for Tuesday. Same experience. Got a call AFTER waiting all day. Told that since the refrigerator was ready but not the dishwasher it needed to be rescheduled. We rescheduled for today. Same experienced. We waited all day. After 6 pm, the window had passed and I called local delivery dispatch. They said there was never a delivery scheduled for today-- although we had the confirmation texts yesterday and today about it. She said our appliances were never loaded on the truck. We rescheduled--4th time!!!!- for a week from now. We sincerely hope to find appliances available elsewhere and will cancel our purchases if so. Be warned. It's probably all stores right now as Covid has delayed the pipeline and inventory is way low. But hopefully other stores are telling their customers the truth with realistic delivery times. This is crazy making.UPDATE- After yet another botched delivery date passed, waited, no word from HD, with yet another delivery date set about a week out. Ugh. We decided to process a return on our 2 appliances. We've found 2 brand new replacement items elsewhere and installed them yesterday. Be aware-- Getting a refund is tougher if you paid by debit card, which we did. (crazy right? We paid with cash in full and are penalized with a waiting period). What I've learned? There are appliances in stock elsewhere, ask by specific model #s and you'll find one. Waiting 3 months is not necessary. We didn't have time to wait as this is to get a rent house rent ready ASAP.",0,1

The Home Depot,I share your oven story and you should…,"I share your oven story and you should be glad you dodged a bullet. Home Depot is the worst. I purchased an oven; it was delivered 5.23.20, and the gas company was called 5.31.20 as the CO detector in my home went off, and never used the OVEN (only top burners), when I did use the oven, I had to called the gas company again 6.27.20 and they shut the gas off completely as the range was producing high levels of PPM, as soon as the guy from the gas company walked in my home, his meter start going off as it was that much carbon monoxide in my home. Then the replacement process was awful. As there are too many 3rd parties that Home Depot deals with. Now, I have no gas and can't cook, can't even boil an egg, as the gas was shut off on 6.27.20. Now for the good part, the replacement was to arrive 7.27.20 a freaking month later. It did arrive, but it wasn't new, had dents and scratches all over. Now, I went into Home Depot on 7.27.20 the day the jacked up replacement range was delivered and received a full refund... do you know they (HD) still haven't come and picked that defective oven up, it's still in my garage. The reason it was defective, they sent a company called Unique Repair to try & repair it, and was informed that the gas valve wasn't seated properly into the burner venturi, which means whenever I used the oven, all of the gas was coming into my home and not the oven. I preset the oven at 350 and it took 45 minutes for it to beep at let me know the oven reach 350 degrees. When the oven ignited it was burning the back of the bottom drawer. No help from Home Depot in anyway, not even after their gas range almost killed me. No accountability what so ever. Home Depot suck.",0,1

The Home Depot,Watch out for Londonderry NH Home Depot. Covid Spreaders.,"I went to my local Home depot in NH and found several employees walking around with either no masks or the masks were around their necks. I spoke to an employee wondering why some of their employees were not wearing a mask and MANY customers had no masks at all. The employee said that they do not enforce the wearing of masks, yet in the same town, I can't get into Walmart or any of my grocery stores without wearing a mask. I will no longer shop at Home Depot and I suggest anyone worried about Covid should NOT go to my Home Depot. The manager should be fired or demoted for letting his employees wear masks around their necks. They also had many customers walking around with no masks at all. To all the customers that don't care about others, Hope you learn the hard way. No more Depot for me.",0,1

Paid $8.45 each, but got Angelus blocks instead that cost $1.10 each and don't even weigh 20 lbs. each. When I called the manager of the local store, was told that CHAT and their HOME DEPOT store are two different companies and local manager would not honor the promises made in CHAT. Local manager said if I made another order, MAYBE it would be delivered in two weeks, delivery guy could pick up the worthless blocks. How do I know I'm going to get the right product in the next order? Are they going to honor my payment for the more expensive blocks?

The Home Depot,Home Depot refuses to honor promised discount,"We signed up for a Home Depot credit card on July 26, 2020 in order to purchase an air purifier online. We had several options for this purchase, but specifically chose Home Depot because of an offer on the Home Depot webpage of a $50 credit off the purchase for opening a new card. We immediately had several issues opening the account due to problems with the Home Depot website, which required several telephone communications to complete the card and the purchase. These problems continued to occur, preventing us from paying off the balance immediately, as had been our intention. The problems included Home Depot's inability to provide access for payment due to our lack of a card security code. One representative provided us a temporary code, but when that failed another representative told us we would have to await delivery in the mail of our actual card. During each of these communications we asked when we would receive the $50 discount we had been promised, since we did not wish to pay more than we actually owed, and the promised discount was not being reflected on our purchase statement. We were given various assurances, ranging from the discount being provided upon initial payment, to the discount not being available for two to three billing cycles. While this did not address our immediate concern of paying more than we owed, representatives for Home Depot never at any time disputed the amount of the promised discount, which was indisputably and by their own confirmation $50. When we went to pick up the purifier, we were unable to access curbside service because the local Home Depot's WIFI was down, and we had to enter the store during the height of the Texas Covid-19 outbreak.Today (Aug. 31, 2020), in the course of yet another problem regarding this same account, we were told that we would only be getting a $25 discount, and that the $50 credit only applied to purchases of $300 or more, as reflected in the current ad. This is the first time any representative for Home Depot had ever disputed the original $50 offer. We pointed out that the current ad was entirely different from the one we had relied upon in our initial applications, that the ad we responded to did not include a minimum purchase, and that every one of their representatives we had spoken to in previous conversations had confirmed and promised delivery of the original $50 offer. The Home Depot customer service representatives we spoke to today insisted that the offer was only good for $25 off our $244 dollar purchase and refused to honor their original offer. We told them that we would happily rely on the records of the previous conversations we had with their representatives and asked them why they would not be equally willing to rely on their own records. In response, we were told that it did not matter what those other company representatives may have confirmed or promised, and that they would only honor the terms of the current ad, rather than the offer made at the time of our purchase. We spoke to several company representatives during the course of what was more than an hour long phone call. All of them gave us the same story. They ignored our requests to examine their own records and recorded conversations, said they would not be held liable to any previous statements made by their own company representatives, and refused to offer more than the $25 credit offer currently online. We told them that in our opinion this represented a classic bait-and-switch, and was the very essence of a deceptive trade practice. This is less about the money for us than it is about the principle involved. We were promised a specific discount -- $50 -- for opening a credit card. We chose to purchase from Home Depot rather than some other retailer based entirely upon this specific offer. We subsequently endured countless problems with the account itself, and are now being denied half the amount of the promised discount. That is the essence of our complaint, which I just sent off to the consumer division of the office of the Tx AG.",0,1
The Home Depot,Pathetic!,"We ordered-online, a cook top to be delivered to our home from HD. After it arrived I opened it and it was shattered. (Next time, I know, I’ll open a delivery before signing off for it). So an hour later we took it back to HD. The clerk told us it wasn’t downloaded in their system yet that it’s still showing out for delivery, can you bring it back tomorrow? “For real”? 🤨 “Nope not doing that”. So a supervisor had to over ride their system! (And just to compare... we had a delivery from Lowe’s a half hr before HD, and I instantly had an email confirming the delivery. Why is HD so slow with their downloading?!)So we left HD and not even a half hour later, they called and told us we needed to come back & pick up the broken cooktop, for the delivery service will only pick up from where the delivery was made! 😳 OMG WHAT!So now we have a broken cooktop - purchased from HD, but not able to return it to HD - sitting in the basement and who knows when they’ll be picking it up. HD told us it would be in 7 days. Ohhh so is that when my acct will be credited? I have to wait a week (or probably more) for this to be returned?! SMHNeedless to say, We are no longer doing business with Home Depot! We Re-ordered the “same” cooktop at Lowe’s, actually at a much lower price, and from now on... will only do business with Lowe’s! So much easier! 👍🏻",0,1

Now, the day of delivery I call Homedepot to check the status and Iw as told, we're sorry...but the entire order was cancelled. And we didn't send you an email to let you know. I spoke to their resolution department...they admitted in their notes, it clearly says CANCEL WASHING MACHINE ONLY. And yet, they canceled the entire order.

They said it's back ordered for another month and a half...I demanded some form or restitution- they said they could give me a Home Depot gift card to purchase a ""dorm fridge"" for a few months...for a family of 6.

There is NO law that says we have to wear a mask and with a 99.6% survival rate and the CDC claiming masks don't prevent against a virus why is this this CEO going along with the Public Health Officer when they don't have to? Mandate means a recommendation - a choice. I would never take my granddaughters shopping with me because pedophiles love to congratulate when there are children who have parents who get easily distracted. All it takes is a second and your child is gone via the back door, And when you call the police how are they ever going to find this person wearing a mask.

The Home Depot,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RELATIONS,"I recently purchased an Integra pergola from Home Depot. I hired contractors to install the pergola on my home. During the time of installation, there were 8-10 bent lattice pieces for the top of the pergola. The contractor was able to fix all but 3 of the lattice pieces. I called Home Depot numerous times and was advised that they could not get the vendor to respond to their requests for replacement parts. Home Depot's solution was to send me a new pergola, dismantle the one that had been erected and return the old one. I had expended almost as much in contractor fees as the cost of the pergola, and to remove the existing pergola and install the new one would have been cost prohibitive. The only solution that was provided was the remark that Home Depot would mark down the pergola $150.00. This is frustrating and totally does not solve the problem. The customer service person kept asking me what would be the proper solution for me. I stated that the proper solution was to have the parts I needed. I do not have the capability of performing the work to remove and return the existing pergola and the fees to do so would absolutely be prohibitive for me.

The Home Depot,Terrible experience.,"We purchased an outdoor sectional from Home Depot online. The item is missing major parts or features and cannot be used the way it is. We are missing the cushion guard covers which protects the foam. I’ve tried emailing and calling Home Depot and they didn’t seem to not care nor could tell me where the rest of my product was. I even asked for the part of the product we received to be returned and are money refunded. It is currently a expensive piece of non used furniture being stored because we can’t use it. The sectional was shipped from Home Depot to a shipping facility and sat for 3 weeks waiting for the 2nd package (they told me they would wait to ship them together), they ended up delivering the sectional without receiving the 2nd package. 2nd package being the cushion guards. 2nd package just says ordered and schedule unknown at the shipping website, they never got it. Home Depot Website just says on its way. When I called Home Depot I was told all she could see was the shipping label was created and wouldn’t assist me further. Either they need to send us the Correct cushion guards or they they can come pick up their product and give us our money back. We like the local stores but online buying from them is a nightmare. This isn’t the only issue we have had with them.

The Home Depot,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE BUYER BEWARE,"Unfortunatelly there are no 0 stars which would be a bit more than I would give this company. I placed an order for a generator and was told expected date 8/20/20 thru 8/31/20 I had made plans to stay home and wait for my delivery and have someone on dates that I could not. The order was delivered 3 days early so thera was no one home. I did not get a call or an email indicating that the dates had changed. I get a text message showing itam was delivered. Surprice Surprice when I got home it was not there I tried tracking my package and got a pop up from the web site saying to wait up to three day to then contact them. After several attempts I finally get a rep. who tells me she does not show it as delivered in their system. Latter comes back to the line and gives me the name of the company who made the suppossed delivery she indicated that they told her that they had authorization to leave the package without notifing meor getting a signature. I asked who would have given that authorization and she said I would have had to do that because HD does not authorize them to do that. I then call the Delivery Company and they said yeah we left it and HD gives us the authorization to do that because it would delay things if we had to call everyone. I call HD back and was told I now neededto speak to a Resolution Manager, the nastiest person I have ever spoken to. NATE, told me that I should contact the financial institution because they could do nothing. I was not happy with her response and I told her that it did not seem right. She said that the only thing that they require signatures on is Major Appliances and it did not matter that this item was just as expensive she latter proceeded to tell me she had had items taken from her door. BUYER BEWARE. HORRIBLE COMPANY......",0,1

Why wouldn't their website have that information? The website indicated it was in stock and the first email i got confirmed it would be delivered on time.. I already paid for it and went without a fridge for several days. Then im being forced to decide if i should go without a fridge for another 2 weeks or cancel my order and start the process all over again. Its extremely frusterating that home depot takes no responsibility for this and offers nothing in compensation. Just a heads up, if you need an appliance and care about how long it takes to get it, buy it in person, at a store. Preferably not Home Depot.",0,1

The Home Depot,Nightmare order,"I’ve been having the worst online purchase experience of my life and the nightmare is still going on.I purchased a bathroom vanity on May 30. When the estimated delivery date passed, I called HD and was told that deliveries are delayed due to Covid. So after weeks with no updates, I noticed that I started getting several tracking numbers online. I called customer service and Monica told me I was not getting that item because it’s on back order. I asked her why am I getting these tracking numbers and she told me to ignore them bc their computer info is more updated. So I decided to place a new order with the same vanity but different color which they had in stock. The VERY NEXT DAY, I received my original order. I immediately called them to cancel the new order (bc it can’t be done online btw) and was told that they COULD NOT DO IT until I get a tracking number (what?). I asked her to call the warehouse so they can stop the processing but she said they are unable to contact their own warehouse! Really???More than a month later, I finally get a tracking number AND also the other vanity (the one I was trying to AVOID being delivered to my house). Now the problem is, I can’t get the delivery people to pick it up. I’ve called many times and sent several text messages but get no response back. To the Home Depot CEO : Please call Jeff Bezos and ask him how to run an online business successfully, even in difficult times without getting the customer frustrated and pissed off! This whole experience has been outrageous and using COVID as an excuse is totally pathetic! And also, good luck trying to speak to a manager. He/she is always on a meeting, even at lunch time. Tried to leave a negative review online but it won’t take it due to “technical issues”. If you’re buying something they have it in stock at the store then HD is fine. But buying something online is another story. What you get is red tape, chaos, and the lousiest customer service on this planet.UPDATE: it’s been two months and the vanity is still sitting in my garage. Pick up people send a text message saying they’ll be in the neighborhood and will pick it up, but never show up. Can’t contact them either. Nobody answers back.",0,1
The Home Depot,6/22/20 unhappy senior-Please be aware!,"6/22/20, I purchased a -4-suite of Samsung appliances from the Stapleton(Denver,CO) store. I requested and paid for Black Stainless Steel Appliances. I was assisted by 2 on the floor sales persons. The earliest delivery date was 8/19/2020. The delivery person brought the order and begin with installation o f Range,then dishwasher. I was told the refrigator could not be installed because the water shut-off was not directly behind the old refrigator. I was told i would have to get someon else to shut off the water or call a plumber to move the connector. They left it and said I coulld call back within 30 for new appt. to install. This was the first time I saw the appliance. I immediatly informed the guys that I ordered BLACK STAINLESS STEEL and NOT REGULAR STAINLESS STELL. hE STATED the sales person must have errored when entering in computer. He called the Corp. Office to inform them. He allowed me to speak with the person on the phone. She said she would make the notation and I should contact Home Depot. At this point,the Dishwasher and Range had been installed. he said ,If I did not want the STAIN STEEL that had been installed, he could not reonnect my old appliances. When the delivery guys showed up they didn't ask me to inspect before installation. They further advised me that they could now install the ORM over the range microwave until I could have the old one remove. I went to the STApLETON STORE for assistance. I was told by Carrie, there was nothing they could do and couldn't take appliance back. I asked about the sales person who messed up my order and they said nothing only INITALs on sales receipt. I am a 75 year old woman with health related issues. This experience has caused me extreme stress and increase in BP. I have shopped here for many years and never treated so poorly. I LEFT THE STORE AFTER BEING TOLD,SORRY NOTHING THEY COULD DO. The mistake was made by their in experience sales staff . I paid a lot on money to be this unhappy with my appliances.DAHervey",0,1

Little is done to show confirmation of order details at the time of placing an order. Once the order gets shipped, you cannot change the shipping address. Your only alternative is to cancel the order, get a refund in 2 to 3 days, and reorder. Many orders are currently taking 3 to 4 weeks. In my case when I ordered for in-store pickup, they split the order and sent the largest piece out for ""free"" delivery to my old address without giving me any warning that they were doing this.

I had a receipt for $92, of which $17.84 was store credit and I was returning 19.96. Apparently, we are only allowed a few returns no matter how much we buy. I went through this with them before and ended up boycotting the store for over 2 years until they ended their stupid policy. I told my daughter who said, ""Mom, they think you are a thief."" Yeah, Grandma turns thief at 74 years old. The last time HD did this, the Lowe's manager said to come get her and she will go with me to Home Depot to get my return done.

The Home Depot,Return Policy on brand new product,"I am a 63 yr old single woman. I purchased a generator in May 2019 in case I experienced a power outage. It sat in the box in my living room until 2 days ago, when I did experience a rolling power outage due to the extreme heat in Southern California. With the help of my ex-husband who retired as a mechanic, we unpacked the unit, followed the instructions and filled with the proper amount of oil and gasoline. Followed the instructions to start the unit before we decided to plug anything in to it. The unit started to leak oil. So I took it back to the Home Depot that I purchased it from. They told me that their return policy would not allow me to return it because I purchased it in May and it is now August. I took the brand new box with everything that was packed in the box along with me so they could see that I had just unpacked it. Not a speck of dust on the generator, box or anything else. It would be obvious to anyone that the unit was brand spanking new. The only thing they could do was to take it to their repair area and I would have to wait for their repair man to look at it and I was told that it could be 2 weeks. We are experiencing a heat wave right now and I am very disappointed that I was not told when I purchased the unit that I could only return it within 30 days. I am disappointed that not one of the employees at Home Depot would let me speak with a manager. The manager would only relay information to the employee to relay to me. The unit is brand spanking new! Why would someone not honor a good customer with an exception due to the obviousness of the brand new item? I was so disappointed that I left with the generator. I will contact Briggs and Stratton myself and see what they will do to rectify the situation. I realize that sometimes even brand new things don't work the way they are supposed to and I have had to return brand new things many times. Unless I receive a response from Home Depot, I will no longer be doing business with them. Lowe's is much closer to me and has friendlier people working there anyway. Shame on you Home Depot. Shame on you for not helping an old woman. Not one person that I spoke with at Home Depot was understanding of my situation. I will share my experience with everyone I know and work with. Shame on you.",0,1

The Home Depot,WORST retail experience EVER!!!!,"WORST experience EVER in dealing with a retailer in 66 years! I Purchased a folding table needed for an event in 2 days; it was defective…parts missing and wouldn’t open. Because I’m disabled, I needed to make special arrangements to have it picked up and a new one delivered. Spent 45 min. on the phone, talked with NINE different people, including one who disconnected me, another who—even though I told her to connect me with repair dept. (as directed by previous person)—connected me to some other dept. who couldn't help me.The forth or fifth person tried to make me call yet one MORE number. I asked to speak with his supervisor, so he put me on hold; I waited ANOTHER 10 min., listening to ads that sounded like it was just a general store number, not a manager. Got fed up, hung up, called back, followed speech prompts, and LITERALLY got hung up on…telling me--at 2:30 in the afternoon--to call back during store hours!!!!!! Called again, just in case I’d pressed the wrong speech prompt number…same thing…hung up on again. GRRRRR!! Called the main Customer “Service” (what a joke) number AGAIN and immediately asked to speak with a manager. Nope. There were “no managers available.” She’d leave a message for a manager to read TOMORROW. Thankfully, after some convincing, she did connect me directly to the manager of the local store, whom I'd not been able to get to. Local manager said he’d check his schedule; MAYBE he could find someone to pick up the defective table and deliver a new one before the event. MAYBE??? Told him he’d BETTER find someone due to the time factor. “Well, I can’t create a person,” he said. (Or add a stop to the delivery schedule??????) Told him again he’d BETTER find someone, even if he, the manager, had to put a new table in his car and bring it out himself (a mere 6 miles/8 min. drive; the table folds up to 2' x 2'). He gave some excuse I couldn’t understand. Then, couldn’t I just bring the defective one back myself? !@#$%^&()_)(*&^%$#@#$%^& I'd already explained that the whole reason I needed pickup/delivery was because I’m disabled. He told me AGAIN that he’d check his schedule to see if MAYBE someone could deliver a new table and pick up the defective one…and call me back. I asked him to confirm that he'd call me back yet today. He confirmed that he would do so.How long does it take to check a schedule? And perhaps summon an employee to make the trip? That was THREE hours ago.I’M STILL WAITING!!!!!!!!Update: It’s been 22 hrs. now. No phone call. Apparently, he just wanted to get rid of me and lied in order to do so.

Order was delayed repeatedly in the mail until it was finally out for transit to be delivered on the 29th. Never received it or got another update from it. So it’s lost in the mail at this point. Here’s where the most frustrating part comes into play...my fiancé who placed the order kept attempting to call to see where the order was but COULDN’T GET PASSED THE AUTOMATED MACHINE TO SPEAK TO A REAL PERSON. Obviously the “track your order” wasn’t going to work because it was lost so we needed an actual person’s help. He attempted to call the store closest to us for help but they couldn’t and directed us to another 800 number! So yesterday (AUGUST 15th!) he called another 800 number he found and kept going through the automated messaging again trying to get to an actual person. It finally put him on hold for FIFTEEN minutes before it automatically HUNG UP on him. So I call the actual store again to complain and they give me another 800 number!!!! I’m on the phone for 20 more minutes through this automated messaging before I speak to an actual person and tell them how frustrated I am and her solution is to cancel the order and place a new one, refunding the first one and charging me that $4 again. Oh this time she said the store has the products and I can pick them up in an hour....so I tell her I want to speak to someone else about my experience. She puts me on hold and transfers me to customer service to place a complaint. My complaint is that their phone system is jacked and it shouldn’t be that hard to get through to someone that could have helped me weeks ago and come up with a simple solution. And at this point I don’t even want to pay that 4$ after all the trouble. So this woman transfers me to someone else in online services to help me! The next woman tells me she can either take 10% off that $4 or can apply 10% off my next order if I call another 800 number to have it applied....THATS YOUR SOLUTION HOME DEPOT?! Are you that cheap that after so much of my time wasted for a $4 order, you couldn’t even just give me the $4 back. YOU’LL JUST TAKE 10% off?! Hell no, I’ll take 10% off my next order but now I sure as hell don’t want to order from you again. This is the worst costumer service I’ve ever received and their cheap solution to the problem sums them up as a company.

Have been given 5 different stories, and delivery dates, have had them fail to call me back when they said they would, have had to chase them down, had one manager laugh at me, and not a single offer for a refund or free installation, instead they want to charge me more to have it installed.

The Home Depot,Unhappy Avid Shopping Military Customer,"My husband and I get a military discount in store and online at Lowe's. We primarily shop at Home Depot as they are closer to our home by about 2 miles. Since Home Depot doesn't know how to give military members a card, or a number so that they can shop online, and still receive a military discount, you can only get the discount in the Home Depot stores. This is very frustrating as we are trying to do most of our shopping online with all retailers to be cautious due to Covid-19. We only go inside the local Home Depot when it is absolutely necessary, as people are not social distancing in some of the Home Depots, and we've seen customers in the VA Beach/Princess Anne store without masks on, or with their masks below their nose. It is very frustrating during this time for everyone due to Covid-19 but not being able to use our military benefit of a discount online has forced us to move our business to only shopping at Lowes and other retailers online and we will now move all of our business to Lowes. Thank you Home Depot for not being a supporter of the military in all methods of shopping. You have lost another customer, and I will be sharing this through all my social media, and will be advising everyone of Lowe's military policy of allowing online shopping with the a military discount. You just lost an avid Home Depot customer.",0,1

I called customer service regarding the billing, and they said it takes 7-10 business days to get the cards. But how in the world do I get a bill for a purchase made on 8/4/2020 & 8/3/2020 this quickly. He said the billing begins on the 4th of the month. This is not why I am giving Home Depot 1 Star. Here is the reason for the one star. My husband, and I took our receipt to the local Home Depot to get the credit for the military discount that we qualify for, and get every single time we purchase at Home Depot, but the young man at the Princess Anne Home Depot in Virginia Beach, was a little rude to me, and said we can't get that discount for online purchases, but we have been given that discount numerous times in the past for our online purchases when we show our receipt. I do not understand how you can tell us we don't qualify for the military discount online, when we are trying our hardest to social distance, and not go in person as much as possible due to Covid-19, but we are going to be penalized our discount for making an online purchase? Seriously what is wrong with Home Depot. If we shop online at Lowes we use our military discount all the time. What the heck is Home Depot's problem. When I called and addressed this with the credit dept. the man said he couldn't help me with that, and that it's up to the store whether they will offer military discounts in store. That's bull crap. My husband has given 28 years of his life to the military and yet Home Depot doesn't want to honor the military discount online, and the local store that we always get the military discount from, the rude young man wouldn't honor that for us. I would not be giving this rating to Home Depot, as we shop with them more than any other local hardware store, but to not get the quality service that we expect was wrong. I would really appreciate a courtesy call or email from Home Depot regarding this problem with the VA Beach/Princess Anne Store in Virginia. Sandra & Will Baxter",0,1
The Home Depot,My unending appliance nightmare,I was warned about Home Depot's horrendous service before I placed my order. Nonetheless I placed an order for a kitchen appliance suite. After 2+ months of delays and excuses it's been delayed one more time. Home Depot claims to have no information about the order status and portray themselves as victims of the worldwide production system. In other words it's not their fault and they can't do anything to correct the problem. Can't say I wasn't warned. But some of us need to experience something personally before it sinks in.,0,1

The Home Depot,Flooring Nightmare,"STRONG RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT USE HOME DEPOT FOR YOUR FLOORING NEEDS AS THEY USE A COMPANY CALLED ""USIG"" FOR THEIR FLOORING INSTALLATIONS. I will shorten my story as best I can. My nightmare started in May, 2019 and ended in July, 2020.We contracted with Home Depot to have our existing Pergo and tile removed throughout the house, and then have all that replaced with new Pergo purchased through Home Depot. The cost was in the thousands. Home Depot uses a company called USIG to do their floor installations, and have used them for roughly 20 years. Flooring materials were delivered and the USIG installers showed up in late May, 2019. Only one could speak any English, and that wasn’t much. They removed the existing flooring and installed the new Pergo throughout the house and it looked very nice. The work was completed in June, 2019. However, the USIG installers had not checked the cement foundation to ensure it was level before putting down the new flooring. They should have. The contract stated that the floor would be brought up to specs if it was needed. Within a month after the new flooring was installed, the floor began to creak and squeak throughout when you walked across it. I called and stopped in at Home Depot to complain and asked that someone come out and fix the problem as both labor and materials were under warranty.Communication from/between Home Depot and USIG appeared poor or non-existent from the beginning of this effort. Fast forward to January, 2020. Over the next few weeks, several inspectors came out to inspect the flooring installation - 1 independent, 1 from USIG, and 1 from the manufacturer. Home Depot and USIG received a report stating that the floor was not prepped correctly - that the floor was not flat when the new flooring was installed. Eventually, Home Depot and USIG agreed that USIG would come out and correct the problem (whatever effort that would entail) so that the floor did not squeak. In late May, 2020, a USIG flooring guy came out to start the fix with the mindset that it would be an easy and quick fix - i.e. - taking a few floor boards out here and there, filling in the low spots, and then reinstalling the floor boards. He removed boards and began to pour product on the floor to get it to self-level. As he progressed, he realized the problem was much bigger than originally thought. He discovered that when the original USIG installers did the work, they had not done the necessary prep work to level the floor where needed. After three days, USIG called and told me they might have to replace the entire floor. They would get back to me. Half of our floor had been pulled up down to the cement; furniture and appliances had been moved; our refrigerator was in our living room; our home was in disarray (and it stayed this way for two months). I tried to get updates several times from USIG about next steps, but I got no information or updates from them. I kept escalating until finally Home Depot got someone from USIG headquarters to call and work with me. Only then did things finally start to move forward. It was agreed that USIG would pull up the entire (new) flooring, level the foundation where needed, and redo the whole floor with new product at no cost to me. Product was delivered and USIG sent out their best local installer and by mid-July, 2020, the job was completed. The floor looks great and as of this writing, there is only one place where there is a squeak.In the end (after a year), we got the new floor we wanted with no creaking and squeaking (except in one place so far). But I would not wish this nightmare and process upon my enemy. My advice – do not use Home Depot for your flooring needs because of their relationship with USIG.",0,1
The Home Depot,I placed an online order to be picked…,"I placed an online order to be picked up at a store. I was told the item was damaged in delivery. And then things went into a black hole. Every time I called for status, I was told the order was being delivered . When it did not arrive and I tried to cancel and get a refund, I was told that was not possible because it was being delivered. Customer service was terrible and just kept sending me back and forth.",0,1
The Home Depot,Ran out of paver sand half way though - HD lied to us all the way,"Ordered paver sand on-line when we ran out of sand halfway through project (we bought 4 bags at our local HD). The store recommended this when they could not tell us when they would get it again. Ordered Sat for Monday delivery. Easy. Unfortunately, did not appear but we were told delivery attempted. Odd. We are home all day and never saw a truck. Called Tu and they said it was on the truck being re-delivered. No delivery. Called Wed, told it is unavailable anywhere in their system and that they have not had it. Told them we bought it from Roxbury store four days ago. They refund $. All of this involved over an hour on-hold to various people as their reps tried to call local store. Waste of time. Try again on-line, told another nearby store has it in stock. We pay for it and then try to call store to confirm they actually have it. After trying calling in on three separate phones (and being on-hold for over an hour!!!), we are told on-line system is wrong. They do not have any. Finally ordered from Amazon. And then vowed to give up on HD, Lowe's has better more responsive service. At least you can get through o a human quickly. Enough is enough. Never HD for me again. On-line system unreliable, unwieldily phone systems reverts to hold all the time and when you do get a person, they simply transfer you to another line where you again sit on hold forever. Lousy Lousy service.",0,1

Created a case, advised to wait to see if they could retrieve the package, etc. 2 days later nothing. I was then told by Home Depot, they can't refund my money or send replacement because Fed Ex says it was delivered, (obviously not my home) and told to dispute the charges with my bank.

The Home Depot,Fantastic Delivery,"I have shopped at Home Depot for decades. They didn't have some lumber I needed, so I tried ordering from their competitor. It was a complete fiasco lasting three weeks, cancelled deliveries, wouldn't answer phone, etc. and culminating with my canceling the order. I then ordered from Home Depot on Lawrenceville Hwy in Decatur, GA and they scheduled delivery for the next day and delivered on time. Their competitor likes to blame their incompetent delivery system on the pandemic but this is the second home delivery I've gotten from Home Depot during the pandemic that has been on time.

The Home Depot,If I could rate this a zero star I…,"If I could rate this a zero star I would. I have been going to my local Home Depot in Miramar, Florida for some time now. Usually get good service except recently with the Covid virus the employees are less willing to help you. Just today went looking for a 1/4 inch line for my ice maker to extend it so I can pull out my refrigerator to get to the back easier. There where two guys that work at the area for plumbing and fixtures just talking and doing no work. I asked them where I can find one about 6 to 10 feet long. He immediately said we don't have any. I asked can you show me where I can get then 2 smaller lines to connect together. He responded by saying you have to look for it yourself on the next aisle. He then went back to talking to the other employee. I went to next aisle and found within 2 seconds a 10 foot line specifically for ice maker connections. Went back to the guy and said thanks for the help next time you should know about the stock in your area that you are supposed to know about and take care of. He didn't even flinch. He went back to talking to the same coworker again. I would not have been so upset if they where talking about work that they had to do but they where talking in spanish about their personal lives. I knew exactly what they where talking about since I am latino myself. This even made me more upset. They just didn't care and where getting paid to stand around and talk. I will be calling the Manager at that store and letting him know about my experience also. So be aware when you go shopping at 3183 SW 160th Ave Miramar, Florida Home Depot you are on your own to find things.",0,1
The Home Depot,Worst service ever,"I have used this company for many years. I have bought everything from sod, appliances, flooring, etc. I have never had an experience like I did today. I bought a refrigerator, never got it, and have to wait more than a week to get a refund. Can't speak with a manager, got someone walking by the phone, and then another idiot ""Nancy"" who was just as equally use less. I would hope if you spend hundreds of dollars maybe you might be considered a customer. Also, if I ask for a refund, you have the ability to process it. Not, well we have to cancel it (knowing i didn't get it) and THEN we can give you your money back. Thanks Home Depot, that's the last time we will buy anything from your company.",0,1

The Home Depot,Utter disregard for customer welfare.,"Today Aug 8 I needed several items that I needed, not wanted. I had to go to the Wake Forest NC store to get the four items required. As I entered the building I chose a cart that was located inside of the store thinking that it had been wiped down, good luck with that. The greeter did just that greeted me, very friendly, welcome blah blah. Carts were NOT sanitized, and by the way there were four doors that I could have entered through, absolutely NO entry control. I could NOT find wipes to clean it myself (I carry sanitizer so I used mine to clean it). 2. Even though there are signs REQUIRING the use of masks IAW NC state rules. Again no entry control. Many people not wearing a mask. BUT, in their defense employees were wearing masks.3. Distancing was non existant except a registers. I don't know if the register areas were being cleaned. I was in the building about for twenty minutes. I can't speak to the rest of the day.I don't know if it's H.D. corporate having the belief that they are to BIG and important to observe covid19 state rulings or they just don't care about the health and safety of it's customers or is it local management that think that following state directives does not include them.Hello Lowes, good bye Home Depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,Refused to Perform Installation,"First I called after the materials, vinyl flooring for the master bedroom were delivered by Home Depot. Their scheduler from the Venice office, Ken was too busy to assist me and told me he would call me later in the day. I called around 3:30 and he firmly told me that he would call me at the end of HIS day which was 6 pm. He did call me before 6 pm only to inform me he still did not have an opportunity to schedule me. Finally, by mid-morning he called me and said an installer would be there the following day. Prior to this install, I was told that I would have to handle any electronics and mirrors. I agreed. The installer showed up, I showed him the room and all the materials delivered. Next I get a call from Ken who tells me that everything has to be removed from the room. I told him that was impossible and no one said this was a requirement. I told him they installed a new floor in the spare bedroom in June and the furniture was just moved to one side and then the other as the floor was installed. I also informed him that I had friends who did not move all their furniture from the room prior to installation of laminate. He continued to argue with me. Next I knew the installer left without saying a word. Due to issues with Home Depot I waited almost 5 weeks for this floor. Now I have a partially disassembled bedroom, no installation and unsure what is going on. At no point did anyone from Home Depot or your company ever inform me that all the furniture had to be removed otherwise I would have went with a more reasonable company because moving all the furniture out is NOT an option. Plus I didn't have to move the furniture from the spare bedroom. I feel completely disrespected by Ken and his installer. They made no effort to work with me. One just made demands while the other didn't even have the courtesy to speak with me. I have a call in with the local Home Depot manager in hopes something can be resolved. The manager, Stacy called and told me everything that had to be done in order to reschedule the installation. None of this was told me by either the Home Depot store associate or the rep who came out to measure the floor. So I agreed. Then the morning of the second scheduled date, an elderly couple came to my home. Once again after being on site for less than 15 minutes they left. The boss, Ken called once again telling me the carpet was too dirty. I told him furniture was just moved and the carpet was over 20 years over. I offered to vacuum it but he said there was nothing that could be done. The Home Depot manager, Stacy also washed her hands of it. So I was left with product and a completely disassembled room once again. I contacted American Trust Wood Flooring who came out and did the job without moving any furniture from",0,1

The Home Depot,Covid State Mandate being ignored,"Our state requires masks in public places. Home Depot has this posted outside. That's the end of them even considering the general public's safety. Walk inside on any day, and you'll see people without masks. When I questioned a few employees, they told me they were not allowed to tell customers they have to wear a mask. I understand not having a min wage employee confront some angry 'it's my right' customer about our state rules. However- hire a security guard like other businesses have done. One employee told me 'ultimately, it's their personal choice'. I DISAGREE!! It's a state mandate, and it's about ALL of us, not just the stupid ones who think no rules apply to them, and they risk everyone's safety.

The Home Depot,HomeDepot.com Will Rip You Off! Ripp-Off Alert!!,"If you're reading this, you most likely already had a terrible experience with Home Depot. If you are being proactive - Do Not Order From HomeDepot.com! It is hard to believe in this day and age, and a company as large as Home Depot, but they simply take your order and have no intentions of following up, as far as actually delivering your items - whether it is being delivered to your residence, or to the store. Once your order is placed, that is it - no delivery, no nothing. I ordered a lawn mower, waited about a week past the delivery date and began calling frantically to find my mower. It was to be delivered to my home, but they completely lost it in transit. After calling several trucking companies I was able to locate it sitting at a local cartage company, waiting to hear from Home Depot. Home Depot was adamant that they weren't going to help me and began avoiding my calls altogether. They would place me on hold and not come back to the phone, or just let the phone ring without answering. Unfortunately I didn't learn my lesson with that order, so I placed another order, for a grill this time. It was supposed to be delivered to the store and I would pick it up. Two weeks past delivery, I called numerous times but no one was willing to help me out. It turned out the manufacturer never supplied the grill to FedEx and it was never delivered to the store. I had to cancel the order - and they were not happy about the cancellation. I could not imagine a worse shopping experience. Judging by all the negative reviews, I feel sure Home Depot will be soon wondering why online sales are declining tremendously. The question is will they actually try to fix the issue (not likely).",0,1

The Home Depot,Disappointed 6,"On July 20,2020, I had placed a order of some tiles and masonry stuff with home depot in store at Quincy total $3,600. I have received an email stating that the tiles of 68 boxes was on it's way, the received date was July 30, anyway the masonry products was not prepared for a schedule delivery, which I paid for. I called the Quincy home depot several times spoke with 2 managers Stephanie and Chris about my order and Chris had tracked my order and said that the tiles is in Pennsylvania and I had stated that I would like the masonry items deliver so I can start my project. Chris was kind and made arrangements for a delivery, I called the store to make sure my delivery was allset and was told that It is being fulfilled by another home depot and was told that I should call them, I requested a phone number and was given 6174790707, which I called, after several attempts and staying several minutes on the phone, finally someone picked up the phone name Scott, I give him my order number H2670-129495 and he said that the masonry order will be at the loading dock and that a outside contracted company does the delivery and that my window is from 6am to 8pm, I Express my concerns for waiting around for so many hours for a delivery. Until now I did not recieved any of my order item and I am greatly dissatisfied with the service, hopefully a the Home depot management team will trace and see where my orders are and customers should not be doing all the foot work after spending their money. This is not the first time, that I had issues, next time I will have to explore other avenues. Highly disappointed",0,1
The Home Depot,"I wish I could give a ""0"" rating","I wish I could give a ""0"" rating. I have been trying to order an outdoor patio set from Home Depot since the beginning of July and I still can't get the order completed. I ordered a set and the chairs came without the table. I reached out to Home Depot and they advised me to refuse the delivery. I tried to reorder the same product and was told that it is no longer available. I ordered a mix and match set with a table, a set of two chairs, and a set of four chairs. The set of four chairs came, the table followed and the set of two chairs never came although it stated that it did on the order status. I reached out to Home Depot again and the customer rep placed me on hold to contact the fulfilling company. He was told that due to Covid-19 there is a back up and I should wait until the initially indicated delivery date. Keep in mind that the order status stated that it was delivered along with the table. The agent told me to wait till August 3rd, then wait 48 hours before contacting them if I don't get it. I didn't get it and when I reached out to Home Depot. I was refunded and given the option to reorder. I accepted the refund and placed an order for a completely different set of chairs and when I got the email confirmation for my purchase, I noticed the agent reordered a set of chairs that I previously ordered and received (the set of four chair that made up part of the mix and match order). All this after I provided an item code and asked her to describe the product to me just to make sure. I called Home Depot again and finally got an agent named Orlando who seemed to know what he was doing and I placed my order. I thought I could cancel the previous wrong order, but I was told that it couldn't be done and I would have to wait for the product to be delivered and then I would have to refuse it. I have never experienced incompetence at such a great degree from a big store like Home Depot. I am absolutely frustrated and disappointed, and will never order from Home Depot online again.

The Home Depot,Never order from Home Depot on line again,"I ordered kitchen appliances from the Home Depot on line and it was the worst experience I have ever had. First of all they rescheduled my delivery about 3 times and once they finally gave me a delivery date 2 months out from my original date they sent two of the worst delivery guys ever. They drove my steps when they brought my refrigerator into the house. They scratched my paint and the wood trim beside the refrigerator. They dented the new refrigerator. They moved my old refrigerator to my garage. In the process they took the doors off the old refrigerator and they removed the door to my house claiming they couldn’t get the refrigerator out unless they did so. I ordered a refrigerator, stove, microwave and dish washer. I paid to have everything installed. They didn’t install the microwave. They put the dish washer in the opening but didn’t install the brackets so every time I open the dishwasher door the whole dishwasher comes out from the space. They took my old refrigerator to the garage and left the doors off and left the door to my house off the hinges. Told me that they were going to take the new refrigerator back to the warehouse in Baltimore because they damaged it trying to bring it into the house and they were going to get a new refrigerator and they would be back in about an hour. After waiting 3 hours I called the phone to the Baltimore warehouse and was told that they didn’t have another refrigerator and that I couldn’t get a replacement until September which is about a month away. I then had to reinstall my door to my house. Put the doors back on the refrigerator in my garage to try to salvage the food that had been sitting out for several hours only to find that they had broken my old refrigerator so I now have no refrigerator in my home and they are saying there is nothing they can do. I am so frustrated right now. I will never do business with them again.",0,1

It was hidden and it was very difficult to see what he was doing. I called a neighbor. They were not available. A family member suggested that I take it back to Home Depot to get someone there to assemble it. I did on Monday, August 3rd and after asking a crew member where do I go to ask, he directed me to Paul, a Home Depot associate. I explained my issue, Paul thought I was returning it.

The Home Depot,I purchased a drafting stool from the…,"I purchased a drafting stool from the online store on June 10, 2020 with an expected delivery by July 6. On July 6, I received an email that my order would be delayed by 2-4 weeks. I have since waited more than 4 weeks with no further notice on my order. When I have contacted their customer support, it is an automated system that allows you no way to report that there is a problem with the order. They leave no chance to talk to an actual person. They have no system in place to leave messages on their website and replying to their emails goes nowhere as these are automated and they don't monitor responses. I do no think it is unreasonable to be upset to pay $125 and receive NOTHING after two months with no way to contact the company and talk to a person.",0,1
The Home Depot,Buying an appliance,"Buying an appliance? I'm an idiot, I guess. I bought a new LG washing machine at The Home Depot, Southlake, TX on 10 July 2020. Delivery scheduled for 04 August 2020 (delay due to Covid-19, of course). The delivery folks would not remove my old washer from its pedestal nor install the new washer on the old pedestal. The Southlake store says they told me this was the case when I bought the new machine. I guess I'm stupid, and so is my wife. We do not remember being told this, and it seems if I were told this, I probably would have done something about it at the time of purchase. Now, I've got a new washer on the floor and I've got to figure out how to get my existing pedestal underneath it.Make sure, dear consumer, that when purchasing an appliance at The Home Depot that things like this are clear and you understand what's going to happen at delivery before you buy your appliance. If you don't, you're going to be stuck with resolving the problem yourself. You'll get no reasonable resolution from your friendly Home Depot folks.",0,2
The Home Depot,Home Depot Warranty,"Out of all of the things I've bought from Home Depot, the first time of trying to file a claim on an item that no longer works, was a very, frustrating, and one of my worst experiences dealing with a company. I tried to file a claim for a generator (won't start anymore) and uploaded my receipt THREE times. Talked to several representatives 08/03/2020 and nobody acted like they wanted to help or work. All I received was ""we can't see your receipt"". I told them I uploaded it 3 times. Then then told me that I would need to speak to someone in the Claims Department so they transferred me. Spoke to a guy in the department on 08/04/2020 , same sorry outcome. First he tried to tell me that I didn't purchase a warranty until he looked at the receipt. So I asked him, how is it that you can see the receipt and the other 3 reps that I spoke with couldn't? He told me that they are able to see the receipts all they have to do is enter in the information. He looked into it further and came back to tell me that my warranty ran out. I told him no it did not, I've already checked everything, that's why I'm trying to file a claim. He argued me down as if they didn't want to honor their warranty. So I told him that if you guys don't want to honor your warranty then you should just say so. I'm tired of being sent it circles and landing no where. It appears nobody wanted to help me with my claim and passed me on to the next person. I guess I'll be seeing more of Lowe's than Home Depot. They're glad to take your money but don't want to honor their warranty. I see them totally different now and will relay this information to my family members who also shop there alot. The generator has a 3 year warranty (which I bought on March 4, 2017) on it and also purchased and additional 2 year protection play with Home Depot which kicked in after the manufacturer warranty ran out. Therefore, I'm still covered until March 4, 2022.",0,1

When I finally spoke to a human being (I think) that person referred me to Kohler. I called Kohler and they referred me back to Home Depot customer service who I initially called. Rather than waste my time I called the credit card company to place a hold on the payment until they resolved this issue to my satisfaction.

After multiply calls to assurance and home depot i still have had no come and look at my refrig and have not been reimbursed for my food loss as stated in my contract. I have also complained to LG about it and have gotten nowhere. Beware Home Depot sells many appliances but be ready to be blindsided when you need it repaired even with ext warranty. Buy from a appliance store only then at least you will able to have it repaired if you have problems. I worries me because i purchased a washer and dryer from Home Depot 3 years ago and now hope they don't break down because i probably won't be able to get them repaired.,0,1

Upon delivery I was told that the dishwasher could not be installed and the old one oils not be taken out because of “corner cabinet access preventing installation”. I don’t know why they were so surprised to see cabinets in the kitchen. The guy who installed the previous dishwasher had no problems doing it. I am very surprised and disappointed with Home Depot. I hope they will return the money for installation and disposal of the old dishwasher. The suggestion for the Home Depot would be to reconsider hiring criteria for their delivery staff,0,1
The Home Depot,"""Not our fault"" = No Longer Your Customer","My wife & I (disabled vets in our late-60s) bought a toilet on a Friday afternoon at Home Depot #1504 in Colorado Springs. No help was available during the hour we spent looking and waiting for it, so we dragged the open carton to the Customer Service desk, and asked the employee to have someone make sure all the parts were in the box before our handymen picked it up. Despite assurances on Friday, it took Home Depot three tries on Monday to put an UNUSED toilet and complete set of hardware into a box. My labor bill for a two-man crew spending five hours on three trips to Home Depot (plus one toilet installation) = $767.50. Their ""management team"" response? ""I can't do anything about your labor bill because you didn't use our crew. But I can give you coupons good for discounts on materials for future projects."" My reply: ""What future projects?"" Eventually, they tossed in $250 and a free toilet to see how little it would take to get me shopping again. Of course, their legal department won't let them apologize or admit wrongdoing. But it would be nice to talk to someone in a leadership position with integrity who understands you can lose 40 years of customer loyalty by treating people this way just once. I wrote to HQ in Atlanta, saying I'd settle for a $500 check made out to my local Habitat for Humanity chapter, especially if the money came from the paychecks of store employees who should have kept this from happening. I'm still waiting for a reply 13 months later.

Wednesday rolls around and guess what... now delivery says Friday. Why? Oh one store didn’t have it and now another store needs to deliver it. Ok fine. Friday. What’s my delivery window... 7 am to 9 pm. Are you kidding me? I know we should be at home but you expect me to sit at home for 14 hours? Is this some sick joke?Now I called 3 times before Friday to get a straight answer as to where my freezer is. I am told I will be told the day before roughly when they show up. This never happens.Come Friday I wake up early and make sure the phone is on me. I wait till morning as I get no calls and I ask roughly when the product will come and I told most likely early afternoon. I am assured they will call 30 min before. So again I sit at home waiting. 5 rolls around and nothing. I call again and am told well you’re window is till 9 and the guy did take it to deliver it. Ok... I wait.8:45 rolls around. No call no freezer nothing.Now the store is closed at 8 even though the delivery is to be made by the store till 9. I check the status of the order - delivered! Really? Nope. Says it was delivered around 7. I look around our building 3 times. Nothing! I now have to call the main line who tells me to hold for a supervisor. 85 min go by on hold. 85 min!! Are you kidding me? No check ins on me. I hang up and I’m done. All I want is my freezer. How hard is it for a retailer to deliver a product they said they would deliver on time? I didn’t give them a problem with how I paid - I didn’t make it a hassle - why are they putting me through hell?! I will NEVER order anything from Home Depot online nor will I visit this location ever. This is a disgrace! You would think people care about their jobs and making sure I.

The Home Depot,Home Depot and t and credit card specials,My experience is not about the Home Depot store but online shopping. It is so frustrating when you order something on line and then just a few days later you get a notice via the mail giving you 10% off your online order via your Home Depot Credit Card. At the time of purchase there were no specials or discounts if using your credit card. When I called customer service one rep said it should not be an issue. Never got through so called again and was told flat out NO. I think this is very unfair. I don't see any reason customer service could not change payment status and honor their 10% off.

The Home Depot,Major problems with Home Depot Online,"This review is not for the product I purchased, , it is for the logistics for delivery by Home Depot's 3rd party shipping service. I tried to find the link on Home Depot website to submit feedback, or submit a complaint, or file a review form, none of that was available. I ordered a Galanz fridge a few weeks ago, with standard paid freight (not scheduled freight). I called about 4 days ago, since I have not received any update on the order, or when it will be delivered. After waiting for a long time on the phone, the young lady on the line told me it should be delivered in the next week and for me to wait to hear from them. She said I will receive a call 72 hours in advance warning about the delivery. This afternoon at 12:25 p.m., I get a text on my cell phone with a photo attached, that showed the refrigerator was dropped off on the side of the road, where our subdivision driveway meets the main road, our house is another 100 yards up that subdivision driveway. There was also a text with the photo that says ""you freight has been dropped at your driveway due to no access for trucks at your place"". First of all, that is not our driveway, it is a shared driveway to our property, secondly, we never received a 72 (or 24 or 48) hour call, we would have told them to bring a smaller truck, thirdly, the driver could very well have walked up the road to knock on our door to let us know they are there, and we would have shown them how they can navigate up to our house. We were left with a fridge on the side of the road, what to do? With a great deal of difficulties (my husband and I are senior citizens), we dragged the fridge into the back of our SUV, and drove that up to our property, then again with a lot of difficulties, we managed to unload and bring that into the house. This is just one example of Home Depot's online order problems, we have so many others, including a sink that my husband ordered and waited for weeks for delivery, but apparently they couldn't track down the order, no idea where the product was other than that it left the warehouse, they couldn't find it, and wouldn't let us cancel the order. We had to call the credit card company to dispute the transaction, and we finally got credited for the sink.",0,1

Oh vender did not gave items to FedEx I can't help you. She hands up. I was failed to communicate with her I asked for a manager she put me on hold forever. It's two and a half hours still holding for a manager. They are failing home depot. I am a regular every week customer.

You can only have assitance by SMS. Really ? Try to give a call to 1-800-759-2054, you will finish to drain your mobile battery. Last time that I'm buying from HomeDepot. Stay local, with bussines ownwers that take care of people. The worst, when you go to a HomeDepot Store to buy an applicance, the only thing that they do for you is filling the forms and passing your credit card, but if you have issues, well call to 1-800-759-2054 and pray to have an answer.

The checker listened to me, acknowledged my concerns and then took some money off the price. I wasn’t expecting her to do anything. I always shop at Home Depot.

Took me calling Home Depot which says there’s nothing they can do and I have to wait another week for the vendor to cancel my order. Two weeks holding the money without cancellation or refund to buy another one. Watch using their third party vendors and honestly Homedepot.com remember your one person like I was told were a world wide company so my order is truly not important to them. Home Depot should value their customers and when their told the order is cancelled refund the money immediately. Bad Customer Service.,0,1

I asked them to contact the store and they said we do not do that. I asked about the fuel and time (hour and a half) and the first person disconnected the phone. called the next morning and they said the same thing and I asked for their superior and was told no one is there, I asked them to ask this person to contact me with no response, very disappointing.

The Home Depot,Terrible experience similar to the many…,"Terrible experience similar to the many reviews listed. I bought on line which was my first mistake. I paid for installation on both dishwasher and microwave. When the workers arrived they proceeded to tell me that they could not install my microwave and I needed to get a handyman to do it. Then went over to do the dishwasher and they said they could not install that because I had a water softener system installed previously and that I needed a plumber. Then said that by the end of that day or next a plumber would call me. I called Home Depot and explained that I would be returning microwave. When I returned the microwave, they charged me $25 for no reason other then ""there is nothing wrong with it and Whirlpool won't take it back."" Oh and there is no plumber. We can put it an order for someone to call you that does that sort of work. So now I have a dishwasher sitting in my living room and no microwave. They did refund my installation on both since they didn't do anything. Needless to say, I will NEVER use Home Depot again for anything. I simply don't trust them and still want my $25 back. Buyer Beware.",0,1

Also, they wouldn't refund me and wouldn't send me a new one. Was told I could place an order for a new one and pay a second time on the website, and return the duplicate item if it ever showed up.End resolution was my package never showing up. July 16th I received an email saying my package was officially lost (even though I told them that June 26th, thanks customer service).

The Home Depot,DO NOT BUY APPLIANCES,DO NOT BUY APPLIANCES I bought a dishwasher June 9. Now July 21 and it is still not installed. It took 2 weeks for delivery. Their policy states you have 48 hours to report a problem. They scheduled the install for 2 WEEKS after delivery. The installer found a mechanical problem. Home Depot told me too bad. Your problem now. They also claimed the manufacturer wouldn't help. I called the manufacturer and they sent someone to do repairs yesterday. Today the installer came and found yet ANOTHER mechanical issue. One of the hoses is missing a clamp. Again Home Depot refuses to do anything. These are issues that a typical consumer would not be able to find. By not doing the installs on delivery they are then getting themselves out of problems with the items they sell.,0,1

Which I did the person I spoke with said that they would cancel it manuallyThe next day my credit card was charged for the purchaseI called back and was told that I they couldn't do anything because it was coming from the manufacturer of the patioset I then received a online message saying that it was being picked up from a home depot warehouse by JW logistics.I called customer service once again and told them about all the different things about canceling the orderShe said they refer the to the home depot warehouse and vendor as the same thingI asked about the cancelation a she said there was nothing she could do. I asked what the first person said that could cancel itShe gave me some more excuses cancel it once the carrier was contacted Now all I get from JW logistics is to wait for 3 days for delivery updated informationFrom the beginning of this order till now all I get is excuse.This is the worst customer service and I will never buy anything from this rip off company again,0,1

The Home Depot,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Buyer Beware...they just don't care!,"I truly wish I had the ability to give them a 0 star or negative star. I will never purchase from Home Depot again and as someone who coaches 1000s of real estate investors I will definitely recommend they go to Lowes.So what's my story:I purchased a LG microwave and gas range on June 22nd. I had just purchase my new home and it had an electric range which meant that I had to do a conversion (cost $1500) to change from electric to gas. It was an investment I was willing to make since I love cooking...back to my story. I was told that my appliance would be delivered on July 11th. Perfect because the gas company and electrician was coming on the 13th and they would be able to hook up my appliance.Unfortunately on the day of the deliver, I did not receive my appliance nor a phone call as to where it was. I contacted the delivery company who was clueless and proceeded to contact Home Depot on Sunday only to be told that the appliance company/LG were closed on Sunday and I had to call back on Monday. I called back on Monday and after waiting on the phone for over an hour and multiple drop calls I finally spoke to someone from Home Depot who stated that the item is on backorder which is why they didn't delivered. LG policy is to only deliver if they have all products. Her suggestion was to call LG (why should I called them...when Home Depot took my money). In any case, I asked her which item was on back order (microwave/range). It turned out that the microwave was on back order until Sept 30th. So basically I would not be able to get my range that I paid for until September 30th and it's July 13th...and did I mentioned that I had no stove since I had the electric converted to gas. My question was can I cancel the microwave and just receive the stove. Well I need to cancel my entire order and then I order the stove and the soonest they could get it to me was July 17th (which made no sense to me since the stove was supposedly at the whse to be delivered). Finally the day arrive for me to receive my stove. The delivery guys are outside taking it out the box and my husband said ""Let's go inspect it"" Note: Home Depot has a no return policy on major appliance and if you find damage after the fact you are basically stuck. When we got outside my husband noticed major damage on the back of the range it look like someone dropped it. We refused the delivery and the deliver guy try to reach LG only to be told there was an over 10 minute wait. He decided to just give me the number so he could continue his day. So I contact LG was on hold for over an hour with no response. I contact Home Depot Online and the lady confirmed that LG has been difficult to get ahold of. At that point, I was boiling because it is excuse, passing the buck and blame game everytime I speak to someone. She finally was able to connect with LG who informed me that my range is now on back order until Aug 29th. Seriously!? So the decision was made to refund the order and have me purchase a comparable item and they would give the price that I paid for the range. Sounds like a plan. She transfer me to a local store and when I get on the line with the person in appliances she stated ""I hate when they pass the buck"". I was told that the store manager could reduce the price and this person put me on hold and told me that she will check with her store manager. When she got back on the phone she said that her store manager refuse to do that and that I needed to go back to online to get it worked out. What the name of your store manager ""Steve Thomas Wallace"" He apparently has no customer service skills and simply don't care. This has been an epic fail.I went back to online and basically they were trying to push off some subpar item that would still take until July 29th to receive...this was option one. Or option two is I can wait until August 29th and they would compensate me for the issue. What does compensation look like? I don't know said the resolution specialist. They gave me a $75 gift card which was nothing considering I have to eat out for two weeks. And it's for their store so how is that helping me. After all this back and forth, the resolution specialist determine that my order was indeed cancelled and she couldn't even order the item because it was on back ordered.What was my solution? I went to Lowes and the store manager and the amazing associate Philip didn't bat an eye. They gave us the price we paid for the range at Home Depot and express that they would expedite my order to get us the range as quickly as possible.I will never purchase any appliances or a lightbulb from Home Depot again. The lost a customer for life with a really big mouth and very influential...just saying!",0,1
The Home Depot,I wish I could rate this a minus 5.,"I wish I could rate this a minus 5.We ordered a glass top oven/range because our glass top broke.

We waited all day, no stove. We check the website again, it says ""Ordered"" as if we just ordered it today! I was not happy having my brother call (I'm deaf), and they gave him the run around so I stepped in and told them it was promised the 15th, website said on it's way, where is it. Their answer: Order is pending.How can the order be pending if delivery was the 15th?They said it's backordered. Why is it backordered now, and no one told us or called us??I went to the website and found out it's no longer on sale, they're selling it for $400.00 more than what we paid. I bet that July 15th oven was delivered to the person that paid $1,100.00 and just bought it yesterday instead of us who paid it a month ago!

The kind store rep said she’d contact the installer. After another week of no response, I followed up again, complained and mentioned taking my business elsewhere. She said she recently tried again but didn’t hear from them and would try again. 4 weeks later, I have no door measurements or doors.

The Home Depot,A few positive comments for Home Depot,"A few positive comments to share. One time I had a gallon of paint in the bottom of the shopping cart. I had forgotten it was there when I loaded up my truck. I returned about a half hour later but it was gone, obviously someone took it. The Home Depot manager had the paint dept. make another gallon for me, no charge. I was thankful. Also, at another HD I had purchased an item within a month, when it went on sale, the store manager honored the sale price resulting in a credit for me. So, I have to share that I had 2 good experiences with HD.",0,4
The Home Depot,Horrible Shipping,I ordered a faucet. They shipped it with the box all messed up and banged up. They had to tape the box up just to hold it together. I posted a review on their site with pictures and they emailed me to tell me it didnt fit in their online posting guidelines. What I wrote here was exactly what I wrote along with pictures. I questioned how it didnt fit into their guidelines. I never received a response. I believe people need to know that when they order online it might come all mangled like mine. Very unprofessional.,0,1
The Home Depot,Gloucester Va. Paint Department …,"I would like to commend the Gloucester Va. Store paint department, in particular Obi. We were trying to match a paint color on our porch railing. We had no information to match it up by. We brought in a spindle to color match. It was extremely busy that day, and we were behind a couple with a large order. We were patient. Obi did a superior job helping us get what we wanted in a helpful professional way. I don't usually purchase from Home Depot, but Obi is such a valuable asset that may change at least for paint. Thanks for a job well done during a very stressful time.",0,5

The Home Depot,Deceiving and pathetic military discount,All in all I used to like Home Depot. But since Lowes offers year round military discounts I generally give them my business. The last time I went to Home Depot on July 4th I tried to use my military discount and the cashier said it wouldn't apply to building materials. About the same as a discount at a grocery store for non food items. Give me a break. You couldn't offer a more worthless discount but they don't hesitate to advertise it.

The Home Depot,A Nightmare,"I am writing because I received an email from the General Manager stating that the installation Department installed my rug and they wanted me to take a survey as to if I was satisfied or not. The rug was never installed. For the past eight months or so I've been having nothing but problems with getting this rug installed. From coming at the wrong times to the rug being defective, it's just been one thing after another.The workers were supposed to be at my house the end of the day and workers would be showing up at 7 in the morning 8 in the morning 8:45 in the morning. Does that sound like the end of the day? I scheduled all my other appointments so that I could be home for them to install the rug at the end of the day .this has messed up my schedule too many times it is unacceptable.I don't know how the girl in the office keeps her job , she does not know how to schedule and must be getting me mixed up with somebody else. I am very disappointed and disgusted with the service of the installation department and I canceled my order and did not have the rug installed I brought my business elsewhere, where I got prompt attention and we will have our rug installed immediately. I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars as a customer for years at Home Depot but I will no longer be purchasing anything from Home Depot Overall if I was to rate the installation Department I would give it a zero not 1 star but there was no option for that. I would tell others why I gave it a zero but I don't have to do that because I just looked at the reviews and they were all horrible, they say it all. If I had known this before I ordered the rug fromthem , I would never have ordered it.",0,1

They then say they cannot deliver it because we've been removed from the delivery list. Unbelievable. I call customer service who then tries to contact their contracted delivery service. She then patches me through to them, who were worthless. One hour, 15 minutes later Depot's customer service gal came backon the line. She tried again to contact the delivery company in Indpls and was unable to. She gave me their direct phone #. I called it and got the same woman I had talked to briefly previously who stated her supervisor said the delivery people have been told to go back to us to deliver the refrigerator. It is now 6 hours later and still nothing. Our Depot delivery shows it was delivered, which is wasn't. I cannot get any help on this and I am livid.",0,1

The Home Depot,DON'T BUY FLOORING AT HOME…,"DON'T BUY FLOORING AT HOME DEPOT!!!!!!!!!!!!On June 3, 2020, I went to Home Depot for laminate flooring. All the signs said ""8 Day Delivery if Not in Stock"", so I assumed that the flooring would be delivered within two weeks. The flooring has to stay in the house for a few days before it can be installed, then two or three days for the install. Even with a week extra, it fit my timeline and I paid for flooring and installation.The sales guy was very helpful, and I got a phone call updating me on what would happen. It all seemed good.Two weeks come and go. No flooring and no word. I call. They say they will get back to me. I call again. They finally get back to me-the flooring will arrive on July 2, 2020. (Four weeks from the order date.) The installation will be a week later.Two days before the delivery they call. The delivery window is 8 AM to 6 PM. They did not tell me that the ""delivery"" would be to my yard. If I had known that, I would have had someone on call to help me. I did not know that, so I had to unload a full pallet of laminate from the yard into the basement all by myself OR leave it in the yard for someone to steal. At age 62, I unload a full pallet of laminate from my yard to the basement.So now, today, we are at week five. The installers are set to arrive between 8 AM- 10 AM. They arrive at 12:05.Twenty minutes later, the installers say the floors are far to unlevel and there is no way to install them. They pack up and leave.Five weeks in and Home Depot is telling me ""Oh, well, these things happen."" I said ""You sent out a guy to measure and assess! He told me the floors were level!!!"" The customer service person says ""Well, he really can't tell, the installers are the ones who can tell...""WTH!?!?!??! At no time during this 5-week ordeal did anyone mention that they might not be able to install. If I have known that, I never would have paid them thousands of dollars on June 3.UPDATE: I had a contractor friend come in to level it. He says there should be no problem, it's just a couple of places. He says those guys probably did not want to carry the laminate up from the basement.UPDATE: I asked the installation company how they determined the floor was not level enough. They sent me the installer's notes and photos. The notes said the floors had more than 1/2"" variance. The photos showed the variance. But the photos were of the FLOOR IN THE BASEMENT! The job was not in the basement. The job was in the living quarters. An unpleasant experience all the way around.",0,1

They must have discovered their mistake. There was no way we were going to take it apart again at this point.

So when I spoke to the manager named Allison she was very rude, didn't even apologize just kept making excuses on how I still got a ""coupon"" but that coupon was given to me since the beginning and they did refund me the cord that I drove 30 minutes to get myself that the installation crew broke.

The Home Depot,7 RESCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES,"NEVER order major appliances or contract Home Depot's home improvement services. The minimal savings on the front end or ability to use your store card is not worth the shameful lack of proper service you'll NO DOUBT suffer from on the back end!! This is my 2nd time in about 4 yrs and both times were nightmares! Their appliance delivery department is an astonishingly, shameful mess! They must still be using paper files with a dept only staffed by unpaid, part-time interns to track appliance orders.Customer service is an endless loop of extremely long hold times, being transferred to the wrong departments, apathetic or uknowlegable customer service reps who each give you different answers AND THERE IS ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY from the lower level reps to upper management! I typically wait to order major appliances around major holidays so I can maximize on the sales. I ordered 4 appliances on May 18th. Today is July 7th and THEY RESCHEDULED MY DELIVERY 7 TIMES!! The last 2xs they waited until the delivery time frame to give the same dog ate my homework excuse of ""THE DELIVERY DRIVER HAD AN EMERGENCY AND THE DELIVERY HAS TO BE RESCHEDULED!!!"" AND I already had to cancel 2 appliances from that initial order and reorder from a different brand because one of the many reps I spoke to believed those 2 were the reason for the delays. Clearly he was wrong! When the 2nd order was delivered we couldn't even accept the fridge cause it was visibly damaged! So in total 1 item has been delivered to date!I have FIVE KIDS that includes 2 toddlers and I WORK FULL TIME at a demanding job. My husband is in the MILITARY so he is GONE a lot. We rent out the house he bought when he was stationed at Fort Bragg. We purchased these appliances for a family of four whose lease began on June 1st. Due to this debacle we had to rent 2 appliances from Rent A Center so the family can cook and have a place to store perishables. If we didnt do that this family would have no appliances in the middle of quarantining due to the pandemic! There are companies that are just as big that have fail safes in place that prevents customers from getting lost in their huge customer service maze. Clearly this company does not. IT BOILS DOWN TO THIS since THEY ARE THE MCDONALDS' OF HOME IMPROVEMENT they do not care if they lose customers due to poor service because they'll make money off of all the others who have yet to know their fate.Home Depot's standard store card typically only gives you 6 months interest free anyway. So you are better off having a regular credit card that you keep at a zero balance so when you need to make a major purchase you will probably have an offer for 12 or 18 month interest free once you add a balance.So go to an appliance only store or a company that only focuses on the home improvement service you need and put it on that credit card. Home Depot is only good for quick in store purchases. (Even with that good luck finding a store clerk willing to help!) YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!!",0,1

Very simple..I know home depot had the correct information on the order. I called c6 from Madison construction and he said that someone told him to measure front door and that I need to go back to the store to resubmit another po to measure the back door. Now I'm fuming. He would not tell me who said the front door he then said o we are just going to rip the whole front hput. No you will not ! He was looking to make a small door installation into a building job. I get it. I tried to discuss installing a garage door instead he blew me off and told me very passive that he don't do that..well i was trying to throw ideas around with a professional who wanted no parts of helping me out what so ever..not a pinch! He wasn't even trying to build business for himself..or hd... my question is why would a commercial builder come out to a door installation job???? Seems a bit too shady ...so how did he measure the door if the door was closed? Why would this guy do this to me ?? I'm not going anywhere..this is my house and it is not for sale!

The Home Depot,"Home Depot? Or, am I buying from Helen of Troy?","There’s a Quarry operating behind my house and the dust is very high. I needed two air purifiers that would remove most of the dust from the air inside my home so I bought two high-end Honeywell HPA 3300 hepa filter devices from Home Depot.I thought that since Honeywell is a well-known company with a good reputation I would not have to do any detailed research on filters. I was soooo wrong. And, I thought I could buy the replacement filters through Home Depot,again I was sooooo wrong.Honeywell has contracted Helen of Troy to supply filter replacements and to build the devices. Their website is a mess in that it does not help the customer locate the replacement filters for the HPA3300. Instead, it. Recognizes the HPA 300 series along with other models, but does not list the HPA3300. Oh wait...but it does list the HPA5300....interesting. So, there is no replacement filters for the HPA3300? After sending email inquiries to Helen of Troy and getting a response back I discovered there are several weaknesses/failures in the website design. They assumed the average customer would relate the HPA300 series series to the HPA3300. Really? I explained that’s not logical since they list the HPA5300. She agreed, but couldn’t fix it and she didn’t think management would either.Next, I ordered two sets of replacement filters ($186.00) through their website. Another FAILURE of that website is that the only printed confirmation of the order is what you will see on your computer. Though the website says an email is being sent, it does NOT arrive.Then, there are no packaging, shipping, status updates sent to the customer about the order. You are left with not knowing when the product is expected to arrive or who the shipper is (UPS, USPS, FedEx).So, bottom line is that I would strongly recommend NO ONE BUY ANYTHING from Helen of Troy or KAZ which is another problem are. They do not maintain any consistency in identifying their company. It’s either Helen of Troy (aka: HoT) or KAZ...which is it? Because of these items I have listed, they are beginning to look like scam artists who are in the business of deceiving the customer, taking their money, and their credit card info for future illegal use.",0,1
The Home Depot,Why I am now going to Lowes and NEVER AGAIN Home Depot,"I ordered a hot tub from Home Depot back in May but the next day I cancelled that order. I would have rather pulled my own teeth than to deal with Home Depot. I spent hours on the phone and multiple phone calls to their escalation center. I ended up doing a charge back with my bank. Fast forward a month Home Depot tried to deliver the hut tub. I ended up declining the delivery. Then Home Depot decided to bill my credit card again so they can do a refund. So a 2nd charge back was opened under this merchant.About a month ago I also ordered a new grate for my grill that never came. When I addressed help with Home Depot they said sorry and to call UPS. Working with UPS the form for the claim was geared towards Home Depot and was confusing.

The Home Depot,Worst customer service ever,"We bought a lawn mower which was starting once and then never again. Brought it back to the store last Monday. They told us because we are 2 days too late for the warranty (4 weeks), we can do a work order ($20) and let them repair it. Paid $20. Went back today. They told me it will take 2-3 weeks for them to even look at it.Called customer service. They couldn't help either. Said, I should have called the service number (whatever number that is) and they would have it repaired with no charge. WHY DID NOBODY FROM HOME DEPOT EVEN TELLING ME THAT?Instead, they gave me a wrong phone number!!!

The Home Depot,Home Depot customer service is terrible.,"I recently purchased a tv stand online. It arrived on time with no visible damage or missing parts. After 3 hours of putting it together the last piece to put in was a drawer but it wouldn't fit, defect with rails. I called home depot online and they passed the buck to vendor of t.v. stand. I called vendor and they referred me to their parts warranty department which requested pictures of drawer. I sent them pics and a week later still no resolution or even communication. Finally i showed up at local home depot and was told almost immediately that no help would be made available. I purchased rails out of pocket $12 dollars, after already paying over $400 dollars with shipping for stand. Buyer beware- company will not stand by product if defective.",0,1
The Home Depot,Do NOT shop here! - they do not deserve your business...,"Horrific customer service! ...I placed an online order for over 250bags of mulch and 20 bales of pine straw, payed $79 for delivery and had to wait a week for the first delivery slot. Fast forward to the scheduled delivery date: Home Depot made zero attempt to try and deliver the goods on the scheduled date (after I had taken a day off work as the provided delivery window was an entire day (6am-8pm)). After phoning to find out where my goods were, I was first lied to - told they had attempted to deliver and no one was home (They had not). Then was told ""sorry we're running late"". I expected them to provide a later time slot that day, but instead was told ""another few days to weeks, but we cant provide an updated delivery date"". Apparently they knew about the delays in advance but had not bothered to let me know. They did not care I had taken a day off work to receive their delivery, nor that they expected me to magically be available for some future delivery without them specificity a date.Being frustrated at my local stores complete lack of professionalism and ZERO Customer Service, I took the time to write a detailed email to Home Depot's corporate customer service email address, explaining what had happened and requesting someone to provide an updated delivery date asap. To my amazement I received an automated response saying their Customer Service mailbox is un-monitored and not to expect a response!!!! - So... even HD corporate have no customer service!

The Home Depot,Home Depot/ LG OTR microwave Nightmare,"I ordered a new LG microwave online through Home Depot over 3 weeks ago early June 2020 to be delivered Monday June 29th 2020. I paid $400 for the microwave $135 for expert installation and $25 for removal of the old over the range microwave. The two delivery guys that were with a third party company (FSA logistix) Home Depot contracts this 3rd party company to deliver the new product remove the old product and install the new one.when the delivery guys arrived at my house and came in my house they had no mask on and I asked them had they had covid-19 or any symptoms and they said oh we're fine.? Thus began the worst appliance insulation odyssey I've ever dealt with in my life. First the delivery guys had no clue that they were even supposed to install or remove another one, they brought no tools, it was the most unprofessional jackleg BS show I've ever seen. They didn't install the over the range microwave correctly they did not put the blower motor fans correctly and within less than 30 minutes of them leaving it started coming loose from the cabinet it was attached to over my range. The used the wrong screws to install it to the cabinets one of them was holding nothing the other one was barely hanging on so they had already damaged the microwave by their feeble attempt at trying to install something they had no clue how to do. I spent the next four and a half hours at the local Home Depot and on the phone with Home Depot and LG customer service attempting to get this resolved I finally gave up and told them to come pick the thing up and refund me all my money. It was literally hanging off the wall I told them to come back and pick it up and they told me it would be 10 days before they could come back and pick it up. I'm struggling with Home Depot and LG to get a refund on the microwave and to get Home Depot to refund me for a pathetic attempt at installation. I will never use Home Depot installation services ever again. I had to take the thing down because no one would come back from Home Depot. I had to get a neighbor to come and help me get it down before it hurt somebody. I have never dealt with such a horrible process in my life.I don't know who's harder to deal with LG or Home Depot but they both were equally awful at attempting to resolve the situation.at this point I'm out $600.00 I just want a refund for everything and I'll start over and go somewhere else and have a real professional install the unit.

The Home Depot,Home Depot Nightmare order portable washer…,"I placed an order for a portable clothes washer on May 25th, 2020. This was to be delivered on June 8th with an additional purchase of a dolly to move it with. The dolly arrived without the full contents so that it was not possible to assemble it. It was nonfunctional. The washer did not arrive. I called Home Depot to find that it was on backorder for three weeks. I then checked the Home Depot website for the availability of this item and it went back and forth between accepting orders and identifying the item as on backorder. Why would they still be taking orders on a backordered item? I received an email that the appliance was to be delivered June 25th. It did not arrive until June 29th with a delivery box that showed no damage. When opened, the machine had obvious dents (nearly punctures and cross folds) and damage on THREE sides. I called customer service and experienced hangups, rerouting, and after five attempts and nearly 30 minutes of wait time, I spoke with a customer service representative. I was told that the machine was packaged by robots and any damage would not have been detected by the robot before shipment. I was told that anytime an item is ordered and delivered there is a risk of damage and I should go into a store if this was a concern (I am at high risk medical for Covid-19 severe complications). I was told that for return pick-up I would need to place the appliance outside for UPS pick up and that it was not possible to identify a specific time for their one-attempt pick-up as Home Depot did not have an agreement with UPS to make a call to schedule an exact pick-up time. I was instructed to make the appliance ready and available for pick up at anytime 8 am - 8 pm, Mon-Fri. I identified this as unreasonable to leave a major appliance outside for a five-day time span without knowing the day/time of pick-up. The customer service rep told me that in his neighborhood he would not have a problem with this. I suggested that this was not a helpful statement as he could not possibly know a customer's neighborhood situation. I was told that there were two of the ordered items made available for delivery on June 16th and I received one of them. The next availability of this back ordered item was 12 units available on July 14th and then 35 units available sometime in August. If I opted to reorder, I would then be at the back of the line of orders. I was given the option to keep and use the damaged item until a replacement arrived at an unspecified time, but I would need to pay for an additional machine and not receive my refund on the damaged one until it was returned. I would then be paying double for the use of an obviously damaged appliance. Would it function properly with the amount of clear and significant damage? Would I have home damage from a leaking washing machine? This has been a nightmare experience with Home Depot. I am returning the item, have asked for a full refund, and will not be purchasing from Home Depot in the future.",0,1
The Home Depot,A washing machine,"I was in need of a washing machine, so I got online looking. I found one at the I wanted in my price range. So I called Home Depot Store in Brandon, Ms. Asked for the appliance dept, I was put on hold for about 10 minutes, then someone at customer service picked up the phone & I again asked for appliance dept, again I was put on hold. Customer service answered the phone and asked if she could help. I asked about the washing machine that I saw online and did the store have any? She said 'I dont have that machine, but I do have an economy one. I said, ok. I got dressed went to home depot, went straight to the appliance dept. I waited about 10 and a friendly lady asked what I needed. I asked her if they had the Amana washer in, she said I think so and did I want one? I said yes & i waited awhile and the guy was bringing it out the back. Whoever answered the phone at customer service LIED! The appliance I wanted was in stock. If she didn't know, she should've said , I dont know.If they dont know what the store has, then they should let the customer know. I wont waste my time calling again, I'll go to the store.

The Home Depot,Ordered a stove -  Terrible delivery and installation experience,"Ordered a stove, and paid for delivery, company. Came to deliver the stove, and immediately started with the complaining, and in typical fashion, find a way to not install the stove, like they have done before. I now realize that Home Depot, absolutely do not care what your experience is with delivery or installlation, as the companies that they hire for such purposes are the absolute worst. I will probably seek other options for my major purchase needs, as this is the second time they have done this nonsense to me. If this is acceptable to Home Depot, then they do not deserve my business, if they are going to take my money and spit in my face and could care less about the delivery and installation of their products. I am absolutely dissatisfied with this experience, and O will not go through that with them again. Absolutely unacceptable service, they set no expectations, and then the delivery company comes and says well this needs to have been done, and they cannot do the installation.",0,1

The Home Depot,"Poor management, structue, and customer service","I have recently moved to buffalo NY area and the Homedepot on Transit Rd is the worst store I have shoped at, it lacks structure, management, and very lacking in good customer service. I placed an order on June 1st 2020. Some items required delivery and some items were for in store pick up. My in store pick up items took about a week and a half to two weeks to finally pick up, but because of the time it took to finially have the items picked, many of my products I ordered (which were all in stock at the time I ordered) were no longer available. The store's associate manager brushed it off like its a normal thing and didnt care much.At this point there are items I still have not received yet. One of the items being a hot water tank which shows on the tracking app as already delivered to the store on June 18th 2020, with the estimated pick up on June 23rd 2020. However, it is now about 10 days since its delivery and I still haven't been given an email to go pick it up. I have always appreciated Homedepots quality and great service in the past, but that is no longer the case after this experience with the company. I understand that because of the COVID-19, demand has been high. However, it has been months since the beginning of the pandemic, thw company's management team should have developed a proper strategy to fulfill the high demand. At this moment I as a customer feel cheated since the company has charged me hundreds if not thousands of dollars, but even though products are ready I am unable to pick it up, and in a sense I am told to hurry up and wait until they are ready. It is even worse when the store management dont care. It is apparent that this store only cares about their quantity on customers and not the quality of their service. I think I will avoide going to this store and just go to lowes instead.",0,1
The Home Depot,**Buyer Beware of Home Depot’s 48 hour…,"**Buyer Beware of Home Depot’s 48 hour return policy on major appliances** We spent $1500 for a new washer and dryer on May 24th. We have still not been able to use it. It was delivered on the 4th. The delivery/installation guys plugged them in and hooked up the hoses. As they were walking out they said “Do a cycle without clothes then you can use it. It will balance it out.” Never having a top loader, we trusted him. The outside looked great when they delivered it. On the morning of the 7th I did my first load ***A LITTLE OVER 48 HOURS*** (we moved across the country and were moving in furniture and unloading trucks the whole weekend) and it kept filling with water and going through the spin cycle over and over. Come to find out it was delivered with a rod broken. They refused to take it back because it was past the 48 hour mark. We’ve been having to go through the manufacture warranty now and it has been absolute nightmare. I was on the phone with Home Depot’s customer service for 57 minutes on June 19th to find out why the repairman has not been back to replace the parts when we were told they would be back in 5 days. At this point, it had been 12 days since the repairman had been there. All they did was call the repairman, which I had JUST DONE myself before calling them! This has been the biggest frustration. No one is willing to help. Telling me you understand my frustration is no help at all.",0,1
The Home Depot,Do NOT use HomeDepot home delivery!,"Ordered 6x6 post caps for a back deck refurbishing project because they weren’t offered in store. Many times I’ll order items from Home Depot for my employer and have them delivered to our stores directly or I’ll pick them up at Home Depot if it’s something that could be damaged too easily. Since these are steel brackets and I never had a problem before with deliveries to work I had them shipped to my home to save myself a trip. Since we have our address prominently displayed on our mailbox and the house I thought this would be an easy enough delivery for a person who delivers things for a living. I was wrong. Through either laziness, apathy, incompetence, or a combination of these my package was dropped off 5 doors down from us at an unmarked house out in the rain. Luckily we have a kind neighbor who brought it to us. The carrier was FedEx which normally operates at a high standard. Maybe Home Depot and FedEx have a bad relationship when it comes to home deliveries. Either way I will never use HomeDepot home delivery again and from the looks of these other reviews I’m not alone.",0,1
The Home Depot,Got a measurement from Home Depot…,Got a measurement from Home Depot contractor and they stated we needed to get an asbestos test on the tile. We were putting down indoor/outdoor carpeting to be glued to the tile. We got the asbestos test right after they told us to and paid 80.00 of the test. They stated we had asbestos in the family room #3. We ordered the carpeting and gave the girl the report about the asbestos on 5/27. They scheduled the install for 6/29. Today 6/26 Friday the installers called and asked where was the asbestos report and advised them to call Home Depot. The installers didn't have the report so we emailed to them and they called and stated that the tile in the family room has asbestos but the office WITH THE SAME TILE didn't. They cancelled the installation 24 hours before the appointment. Called Home Depot and they stated there was nothing they could do unless we got the tiles taken off the floor professionality. We have flooded and ripped out carpeting 4 times since 2012 and reinstalled and never had an issue. We paid on the carpeting but all they can't help us. How the flip can you not have all this information 1 week after the order is placed. No one could find the report we had to email it to the installers. Where is the customer service.,0,1
The Home Depot,I purchased a Home Depot extended…,"I purchased a Home Depot extended warranty and it proved to be worthless. The water heater developed a water leak and even though the replacement water heater was covered by the manufacturer, the removal and reinstall was NOT covered by the Home Depot warranty. It broke within the Home Depot warranty period, but Home Depot would not pay for it - they said it was mechanically sound and therefore not broken. This was even though the internal water leak kept putting out the pilot light. Over the next 2 1/2 weeks the leak kept getting worse and with the water heater located in my attic, I had to make the decision to remove/replace it and pay the plumber myself (nearly $600). The Home Depot extended warranty is not worth the paper it is printed on. I even received help from the store management where I purchased the water heater and install package, and they couldn't get me any relief (they could not believe the fact that I could not get the removal/install covered under the warranty). I guess I am now a LOWES customer........",0,1
The Home Depot,Horrible Experience,"I have never had such a horrible experience. I waited a month for delivery because my items were on back order. I ordered all of my kitchen appliances from Home Depot. When the delivery team finally arrived, he refused to install anything. There was a mistake made with the microwave, so it couldn't be installed, but all of his other reasons for installation were unfounded. He told me that I needed to finish the hardwood flooring in the kitchen so that he could install the dishwasher and stove on top. Stoves and dishwashers are designed with adjustable legs so that they can fit well in the space regardless of whether the flooring is level. And we have wood planks in the gap to make it level. He would not install the fridge because the water line was not behind the fridge; rather it is in the cabinet next to the fridge with a hole already cut for access. He said that the gas line for the stove was not up to code, but I already purchased a new gas line with my installation kit, so he should have been able to install it with no issue. He refused to install anything and had me sign to reschedule the delivery before I had time to process that nothing would be delivered after a month of not being able to use my kitchen already. I asked if he could please complete the delivery with no installation, but he said that without everything being up to code, he would not even deliver.I spent an hour on the phone with costumer service to reschedule the delivery only, but was told that I have to call tomorrow because the delivery team is really busy today.I believe that the home depot delivery agent had no intention of installing my appliances or even bringing them upstairs for delivery because they were behind schedule. (They called me to say they would arrive in a half hour, but didn't arrive until more than an hour later). He saw me, a young woman that isn't familiar with appliances and took advantage of me. When I talked to customer service, I was not reassured and I don't believe there will be any repercussions for this treatment. I am very disappointed with this service.",0,1

The customer care agents you are paying regularly hang up the calls. I have had to call several times in the past weeks and only TWICE has an agent stayed on the line with me and actually assisted me. The rest I was hung up on after 1+ hrs of hold time. I am sure there are multiple other call centers in the world that could do 100% better with handling a simple call to check on a purchase or reimbursement.I currently work in property management. 90% of our new appliance purchases are made on homedepot.com. That's at least 2 appliance orders a day, AT LEAST. Why is the purchasing process so easy but trying to get assistance after the purchase so damn hard?

The Home Depot,"Terrible Installer, Terrible Customer Service","I ordered a dishwasher online. First their website advertises free installation on appliances, including dishwashers. I pick out my dishwasher, go to check out and not only do I have to wait 4 weeks, but there is an install charge. I’m annoyed but whatever. I proceed with the purchase. Fast forward to delivery day. Installer gets here and says there is absolutely no way he can get my old dishwasher out without me removing either my countertop or a foot of wood flooring in front of the dishwasher. Leaves the new one and leaves a number to call to reschedule once we have removed flooring. Promises they’ll be back in 48-72 hours once we do that. 30 minutes after they leave, my husband has the old one out without removing or altering anything. I call the number they left to reschedule, spend 1.5 hours on hold, and then told I need transferred somewhere else, she hangs up on me. Call back, another 1.5 hours on hold, she tells me she needs to transfer me somewhere, hangs up on me. I am fuming by this point. I see a different number listed on my receipt and decide to try to call it. This time I’m “only” on hold for 40 minutes. The girl who answers is knowledgeable and helpful. Calls the installer and arranges for them to come back in 3 days. She says I’ll receive a call the night before with my four hour window. Fast forward to install day. I’ve gotten no call with a four hour window so I call the number again. At least hold time was only 15 minutes or so at 7am. She tells me there is no work order in the system for delivery today. Says if I don’t have a work order number, it isn’t scheduled. Says I need to wait another 2 days before they can get back out. Meanwhile, I have had my old dishwasher sitting in the middle of my kitchen, the new dishwasher sitting in the middle of my living room all week. A pile of dishes in my sink and absolutely zero confidence in Home Depot or their installer. I do not honestly believe that come Friday I will have a dishwasher either. I will never ever buy an appliance from Home Depot again.** update ** They did actually arrive on Friday to install the dishwasher (and did a mostly okay job - my husband had to reinstall the insulation that they said “wouldn’t fit”) and without any conversation with anyone or anything they seem to have refunded my install and haul away charges. I don’t know if that was a mistake or something someone did for my troubles, but it was something redeemable on their part.",0,2

After I was on hold for 35 minutes I finally got connected to customer service and promised a call back . Never happened. Got an email A week later with delivery date June 18, then June 23rd. Today is June 23rd and nothing! No call or e-mail. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Don't understand how they are still in business.",0,1
The Home Depot,Don’t shop at Napa Home Depot,"If there was a way to select zero stars I would. Almost every time I go to the Napa Home Depot, I leave frustrated by the lack of service and uninformed employees. Most recently, I was charged twice for the same item that I ordered through their service desk and when this was pointed out to them they refused to give me a refund.The purchase receipt only showed one change, so I didn't know right away that they had actually charged me twice. However, when I went to cancel the order (they had given me an eta and then later called to say the eta had been extended past when I needed the item so I needed to cancel the order), they said I would have to come down to the store to get the refund. I went to the store and spent 45 minutes with the cashier at the service desk (actually 3 different ones because nobody knew how to do the refund). Something seemed suspicious with the refund transaction so I went home and checked the card statement that evening. Low and behold, it was clear they had charged me twice for the item and only refunded one charge instead of both. The following day I returned to Home Depot to show them my card statement and ask for the refund on the second charge. The clerk could not help me and checked with a supervisor and then with the bookkeeper. The bookkeeper said they could not fix the matter as it was the banks problem and that I had to go to Bank of America to resolve the issue. I went to the bank and they said it was clearly Home Depot's mistake and needed to be fixed through them. I contacted Home Depot again but they refused to help. Now I have to file a claim through the credit card company to get my refund. I'm so very upset with Home Depot. The amount of time I've spent dealing with Home Depot without success has me convinced that I'd be better off driving to the Lowe's in Vallejo from now on.",0,1
The Home Depot,If I could rate no stars,"If I could rate no stars, I would. Our family first drove 30 minutes to Logansport for two 24 in wide pantry cabinets. Kristen and customer service were very helpful locating the cabinets we needed (although at another location), helping us apply for a Home Depot card, getting online, ordering, and paying for said cabinets in order to guarantee we could pick them up ASAP. We then drove an additional hour and a half to Noblesville to pick up our cabinets. While there, we picked up paint, primer, brushes, etc for the cabinets. Then went to customer service to pick up our cabinets and Tristen sent someone to get them. A girl brought up the incorrect cabinets, I informed her they were not what we ordered. She scanned the barcode, said “oh shoot”, then I never saw her again. After standing at customer service for awhile, Tristen pointed and told me my cabinets were there- sitting where they had been left. I informed her they were not the ones we ordered. After looking at the computer she said they don’t have the ones we ordered. Next came Mark. Mark offered to refund the cabinets and offered a discount on the paint since we would be losing our $50 coupon from our new Home Depot card. The entire purpose of the paint was to cover our now non existent cabinets. We returned our entire purchase. Or so we thought. Mark stated we could order the cabinets online and ship them to my house. I inquired about the coupon we used and it was only valid in store. First, he said we could not use it again, then stated he was “99 percent positive” we could use it again in store. He also offered a paper stating we were owed $50 from the store with his signature on it. However, this would only be valid at the Noblesville store, an hour and a half away from our home. He also told us the Greenwood location had 3 cabinets we needed available (another hour in the opposite direction of our home) and I was wary of believing that since the Logansport location assured us the Noblesville location had 2 according to their online system. The Noblesville location had one and it was damaged, the door was hanging off the hinges. Tristan refunded our cabinets to the card we just opened and I told my husband we could order them online and ship them to our house. We left and about 10-15 minutes down the road I realized we paid $361.66 for the cabinets alone and the refund receipt only showed a credit of $180.82. We then turned around to immediately go back as we were afraid this would then turn into a “he said, she said” instance and we would have to pay a bill for cabinets we never received. After we were finally settled and my husband verified we were all squared away we began our travels home (with 2 tired and hungry children). After we got home I then pulled up HomeDepot.com to order our cabinets and ship them. THAT. IS. NOT. AN. OPTION. IF Greenwood in fact does have said cabinets, why can’t they be shipped to us considered we wasted an entire day? At this point we would like to cancel our credit card and sever all ties with Home Depot as we will never return. I realize you, as a large corporation, will probably not lose much sleep over what ultimately was a sale of $460.38. But to an average family of 4 this is not money we take lightly. Not even including our wasted day and gas.",0,1

They had been told they needed to call upon arrival due to our living on the second floor of a building and needing to let them in. I only learned after the fact that they did in fact Park at my building but did not bother to call me. My neighbor reported this to me as he had instructed them how and where to park on the street in a small downtown City, Elkhart Indiana. I was not aware of any of this until 2 hours later when the supervisor called me and then having no choice or options for the day. He assured me they would call first thing in the morning and I would be the first delivery. Again I only learned after the fact that they had in fact come to my door at 7 a.m. did not call nor had they called first to alert us that they were on the way. my two granddaughters and I had prepared everything for them which involved moving to entire rooms of furniture in order for them to have free space to get through to the kitchen. I am thoroughly disgusted with the falsehoods and lack of response by home Depot and their delivery company.it took two weeks from the time of me posting this review to get my credit from Home Depot. It took the intervention of several phone calls from me and the work of the local assistant manager to get the refrigerator scanned back into their system.

I am EXTREMELY UPSET that someone would forge my signature on paperwork, saying that I received something I didn't. I called the Pin Oak store which is where it was purchased. I explained when I BOUGHT IT, that it needed to be delivered assembled and put in the backyard as it was being purchased for an 80 year old lady. I talked to a gentleman named Jeff at Pin Oak and he claimed to be the manager. He handed the phone over to a checker by the name of Dee.

The Home Depot,I ordered a door to be installed from…,"I ordered a door to be installed from this particular Home Depot location. The first problem occurred when our doors got delivered to Home Depot's warehouse. Someone backed up into the door in their fork lift and broke it. We got a call informing us of this and that was the first problem. A very rude woman named Jan contacted us. She and her fellow coworkers in the background were laughing about it. For some reason, they found this to be funny. I did not feel the same way. We wanted to speak with a supervisor and one called back. They offered us a very small and unacceptable amount in return for the error. This has been ongoing for months so the exact details are foggy but, it was less than $200. Eventually there was back and forth and we got escalated to a higher up manager named Mario. Mario took over since the previous manager admitted that the refund would have been bigger if I was not a woman. I voiced the concern that I was treated differently due to my gender since, typically, the realm of home improvement is male dominated. Mario worked with us and offered a better refund, around $550, that we accepted. As well as 100$ back on the labor. This was not the end of the problem. Workers came to install the door and the very first problem with the install was that I ordered screens for these doors and I was told they did not come with them and they were not sure if they could be put in. I was mad but, I just wanted the doors to install. Installation team took all day to install. By the end of the day the realized they installed the door completely wrong and that they would need to re install it. The reinstall was going to be down by their manager, a man named Eric. We called Mario to discuss this issue and he said he would work on it and look into the screens. Luckily, Eric came shortly thereafter and installed the door correctly. We still had not heard from Mario and Eric informed us they also did not give us the proper weather stripping. We called back in and we eventually reached the woman from Earlier named Jan. We told her that we had no confidence in Home Depot and that we wanted our refund immediately. She proceeded to get very mad and defensive, call me rude and mean, and it got to the point where I hung up to avoid increased escalation. After that, I called back into the store and spoke with the operations manager of the store. A woman named Sam. I told her everything that has been going on and what had immediately happened with Jan. She seemed disturbed by Jan's behavior and would look into that and the screens & weather stripping. Eventually, they were able to locate these screens and weather stripping. The operations manager Sam told us that they would send out Eric once these were at the warehouse. We had to argue unfortunately to get this pro bono. A month later, Eric comes out to install the screens and weatherstripping. Turns out the people who measured for the screen measured wrong and the screens would not fit. They would have to reorder them again and it could take another month. Upset, we tried to make contact with Sam again. We have been told we would get call backs that never happened. I am at the end of my patience and want something to happen to get my problem solved. Home depot has provided the worst customer experience of my life and I am 63 year old woman battling Long granular Lympocytic Leukemia. Which all this stress is not helping. I am hoping you may be of some help. Thank you for listening. Store #669",0,1

The Home Depot,The management of Home Depot in Orange,"The management of Home Depot in Orange, CT needs to train their employees. They require customers to wear masks, which is fine, but the employees have no consideration for customers.

Most of them were in their late teens and early twenties and probably think they won't get Covid-19.I approached a female customer service representative and asked for help. Her mask was pulled down to expose her mouth. She stood about two feet away from me, which is not consistent with the 6-foot rule. She's at work and should respect those who make her job possible enough to not endanger them.I asked where an item was and she showed me a picture on her phone. I cannot see tiny print on phones and I explained that to her. I don't know why she couldn't just tell me what aisle it was in. The second item I asked about got the same response. She showed me her phone again. I once again told her that I could not see what was on her phone. If she can't do her job according to public safety standards, she shouldn't be employed there or anywhere else.The Home Depot in Orange is now hiring anything capable of filling out an application.

I said I have not received the item I ordered and no one has called me. She said let me call and see what is going on. SOOO I wait for another 32 min and still have not returned to the phone. I said to myself I cannot do this anymore and looked at my account online and it gave me an option to cancel the order, so I canceled it.

Payments are constantly misapplied leaving items showing open that we actually paid. They blame it on the automatic system they use to apply payments and admit it has issues but are not interested in fixing it. Collections will call and call and call but will not review account notes, work to help fix the issues, talk to other departments to help fix the issues, and cannot fix misapplication of funds.",0,1
The Home Depot,Avoid Home Depot at All Cost,"On June 1st I ordered a battery lawn mower for my 88 year old father. On the day it was suppose to be delivered, I received an e-mail notifying me that it would be another 3 weeks before the product could be shipped. After canceling the order online, I made the mistake of contacting the customer service department. Every person I spoke to rude and nasty. Despite the fact that I was hold for a total of 3-hours, the mower was still delivered.",0,1
The Home Depot,Two simple items turned into a night of frustration,"I ordered two simple items online, and very clearly on the page it said '$8.99 delivery for all items'. As I placed the order, the total amount for delivery came to $35. I called immediately to cancel, waited at least 30 minutes - because they give you only 45 MINUTES TO CANCEL - then called another customer service number, which ended up being the same extensive wait and nonsense coming out of a computer (you are NOT able to speak to a person). I finally called the west side store on Verona Rd. where a very nice young man said he could cancel it for me. I'll have to see if my PayPal account has a credit soon, however, he was the only decent thing about dealing with Home Depot tonight. I don't have time to waste, but it was well worth wasting to say that Home Depot's online service is the WORST.",0,1

The Home Depot,My son is fixing up a house in East…,My son is fixing up a house in East Liberty and has spent thousands of dollars at HD. He bought a washer and dryer a dishwasher and all new carpeting in a 6 bedroom house. It took a few days to get the dishwasher plumbed in so it was a week before he could use it. It did not work as water would not drain out of it. When he called HD he was told no returns after 48 hours even if it did not work. He got a GE repairman to look at it and he said it needed a part but when he checked on getting it it was on back order for 30 days. He has renters coming in before that and no dishwasher working. Very frustrating!,0,2
The Home Depot,I have never in my life been so upset,I have never in my life been so upset. I ordered a pool table on line. It didnt say how it shipped just that it cost 89. On 6/7 got an email that is was curb side delivery. I am elderly and handicapped and live alone. I called home depot immediately to cancel spoke with Theo after 45 min wait on phone then he gives me to Vincent which gives me 150 refund and says when. It ships call back as they will ask shipper to deliver at threshold or they will have it go to home depot and they will deliver at no extra cost. I tried to cancel but Vincent said no need we will do this. Then on 6/12 get email order shipped. So I call and talk to Scott again another 50min wait. Scott reaches out to his supervisor and they say shipper wont do it but they can intercept shipment and home depot will deliver it. Then I was on phone addition 30 min for scott todo the program he never had used. He said were all set. Then on 6/16 I get a call at 550am he wakes me up its scott telling me they cant do it. The worst service ever and scott was even rude to me. Saying I shouldn't be upset. Is he kidding me? I have spent thousands of dollars at home depot and NEVER WILL I GIVE THEM A DIME AGAIN. I just purchased new home and have lived at home depot I regret that but still have more to do and will use Lowes or anywhere else. The fact I tried to cancel and Vincent talked me out of it now a 2 week delay in getting my pool table and they lied to me and now have had my money for 2 weeks and the refund is 3 to 5 business days. This Was wrong. No where did it say curb side delivery it have me no option on delivery. After 5 hours of my time on phone this could have just been cancelled when I called the first time. But instead i was lied to. The I was on phone 40 min while he tried to get someone Lorraine comes on nothing to offer she just cancels order and orders refund. Wow just wow,0,1

I was told due to cov-19 shipments are being delayed and told to wait another week. Called again on June 15th to be told the chair is out of stock. Why was I able to make the purchase online, why was I not told that on my first call? I waited three weeks and a total of three hours on the phone to be told no chairs in stock and was given a refund. When I asked for a manager on my third call I was told we do not refer to managers at HomeDepot.com. This was very disappointing and horrible customer service.",0,1
The Home Depot,All in one store!,I just bought a condo had a slew of small fixes to do. HD has it all and at very good prices compared to other home stores. Bought a sliding barn door for pick up in store (Marina del Rey) - customer service was on point during this pandemic and the guy who helped us even came outside to help us load it up in the car. I've also ordered a variety of things for instore pick up. They've been ready within 24-48 hours and pick up was super easy and simple. Their cabinet hardware didn't have as much variety as I would like though in store. Amazon surprisingly has a good deal of items in stock and ready to ship.,0,4

The Home Depot,I recently purchased a Bosch dishwasher…,"I recently purchased a Bosch dishwasher from Home Depot and had them install the dishwasher as well. I knew I would regret it but Home Depot could install it 2 weeks sooner than their competitors. They damaged the dishwasher during the install and failed to leave the hardware that was supplied with the unit to install my custom face panel. When I contacted Home Depot they informed me that I needed to contact the installing company that is a subcontractor of Home Depot. The installing company informed me that they did not have the parts or if they did the installers may have thrown in the trash. Every time I would call Home Depot the phone prompt to discuss any issues with your Bosch product would take you to a Bosch representative who in turn would tell me to call Home Depot. I kept calling the same number until I spoke with a very nice lady at Bosch who informed me that she would send the hardware kit I needed to install my custom panel on my dishwasher face. The hardware kit never came. My advice to everyone, please do not purchase any appliances from Home Depot. If I operated my business as poorly as Home Depot I would have been out of business a long time ago.",0,1
The Home Depot,To Craig Menear-CEO of Home Depot,"To Craig Menear-CEO of Home DepotI shop very frequently at Home Depot and am a stock holder as well. This month for the first time I ordered online with and had 2 toilets shipped directly to my home. They came at different times and due to poor packing from ToTo both were badly broken. (the Home Depot packed parts were not damaged) When I called the phone number to return them both times my wait was nearly one hour. During that time I had to listen to a disgusting recording over and over and over again about how Home Depot was adjusting their hours. I suggest you fire your online management and hire some grade school kids to fix your online business. Maybe do things like offer a call back or teach your suppliers how to pack properly. Maybe you listen to the recording for an hour! For a major retailer you are in the Dark Ages when it comes to online business. Online is more and more the future, if you can't adapt your finished. I will not order anything online from Home Depot again.",0,1
The Home Depot,Handling the covid 19 pandemic,"I have shopped and have had a pro account for many years at the Home Depot. My company does property management and performs maintenance on hundreds of homes. They have handled the covid 19 issue very poorly. When in the store there are long lines, several people without masks as well as employees wearing masks BELOW THEIR NOSES. The store is an unorganized mess as far as dealing with the pandemic. I don't feel safe while in the store. Home Depot management needs to visit MENARDS and learn how to handle the pandemic the proper way. MENARDS requires ALL people in the store to wear masks AND SELLS THEM AT THE DOOR IF YOU DON""T HAVE ONE. They do NOT ALLOW children under 16 in the store. I previously spent a lot of money at the Home Depot but will be purchasing most product at MENARDS OR ACE HARDWARE.",0,1

Then was offered a call back the next time and wouldn't lose my place. No call back! No surprise there! When I finally did get a real person they said they couldn't cancel. After 2 months!!

Now I get an email RETURN slip to send back with my supposed delivered freaking items!! What!! Never ever will I order from them ever again.

The Home Depot,Very poor service on a delivered Weber grill that was missing the ignition part,"Purchased an assembled Weber grill that was to be delivered on a date we selected that was three weeks after purchase. Home Depot called on the delivery date and said the grill was not assembled as they were short of staff. They were to deliver in 7 days. We received the assembled grill and it was covered in dust like it has been sitting in a warehouse for 1-2 years. I cleaned in, installed the propane tank and wanted to use it on the next weekend. I started the grill and found our that the ignition box was never attached to the unit so it would not start. After 11 minutes of waiting on the phone for customer service they told me that I should bring it back for replacement. Not an idea that I cherished. They sent me to a worker in the grill area and he was nice. After finding the they could not order the part and it was not in stock. I asked him to bring me our a replacement grill and take this one back. He talked with two managers and they told him they could not do that. I had to haul the grill back to Lewis Center for replacement or call Weber who should be able to send me the part. was on the phone for over 30 minutes . I am definitely a senior citizen and did not relish trying to load and unload a heavy grill and haul it to customer service. Very poor, very pool customer service at the Lewis Center location. I tried to complete the customer service survey on the receipt, but found that since this process has taken over 10 days ago (actually from order date of May 10 to delivery date of June 11th) I could not submit the form. Would Lowes treat you like this????",0,1
The Home Depot,We bought a mid-range John Deere riding…,"We bought a mid-range John Deere riding mower from Massillon home depot. While looking at it we noticed it was missing the gas cap and the manual was soaking wet. Sales girl didn't seem to care much or know much about the tractor. She did find a gas cap for it ( not the correct one, but it fit.) It was advertised to come with a wagon but she tried to tell us it didn't. We had to look up the ad on our phone and show her to actually get the advertised item. Acted like we were making it up. When it came time to load it on our trailer, they did not know what they were doing and banged it off the side of the trailer! When we got it home and put gas in it to drive it off the trailer, it had a completely dead battery. My husband had to charge it for several hours before we could move it. They aren't supposed to be connected at the store. When spending thousands of dollars on something that is brand new you just expect it to work when you get home. I was not satisfied with this purchase at all and I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future. It's always something when you shop at this home depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,Online Order,"Made an order on Homedepot.com. Had an issue with that order and was told I would need to contact Dot Com via a 1-800 phone number. So, I call the number and was on hold for 1hr and 14 minutes and no one ever answered. I thought perhaps they were just extremely busy so, since they operate until 12 midnight, I call at 10pm. Same thing, no answer. I end up having to call 3 different local stores and a Need Help 800 number I found online and talk to 9 different people concerning my order. In the meantime, I order the same product from another source and it was here in 3 days. I ordered the product from Homedepot.com, 10 days ago and they don't know where it is or anything about the issue they were supposed to document via a case number. I was forced to cancel the order after going in circles with Home Depot saying, give it another day, give it another day. Worst experience I've ever had, hands down. Only 2 people I talked to out of 9 about the Issue actually knew what was going on and how to help me. That's pathetic. Customer Service is nearly non existent via online orders. Consider another source if ordering online from Home Depot. This was a nightmare!!",0,1

However, when renovating our master bath to include a 17 sq' marble countertop everything went south. HD touts best price in Vicksburg but I'll never know. First problem was their sole vendor/installer never called to set appointment to measure. After discussion with HD's manager i finally got a call. It was then i learned my job was too small to interest them (25 sq' or larger). Talked to mgr again. Still no call back. Found a stone company in town that is customer oriented, less expensive and ready to fabricate the counter. Best part, they had stone options better than HD in line with what we were seeking. Further research i found HD's stone has been known to crack. Given the cost involved, this is a case of Buyer Beware.",0,1

The Home Depot,ZERO Stars is too high of a rating,"If I could give ZERO stars I would. I ordered a grill for my parents' anniversary. They are 80 and pretty much at home due to covid, so a grill would be the perfect gift right??? Not so much!Grill was ordered 5/18/20 with a guaranteed delivery date of 5/28.No such luck. Got an email on 5/28 that the delivery was ""delayed"" with nothing else. I could kick myself that we just didn't go pick the grill up, but thought having it delivered to my parents would be easy with the guaranteed date. Have gotten no further updates, no further emails. The online ""help"" shows that the grill was ordered 5/18 to be delivered 5/28. Waited for online customer ""unservice"" one night for over an hour--hung up. The second night, actually got a live person after 55 minutes. Unfortunately, he could tell me nothing other than ""well you're lucky that you can still get the grill"", maybe you'll get it but you can't cancel! Seriously? I ordered it and paid for it and I'm lucky that your company can't deliver a product that I ordered and paid for.So, I headed to my local Home Depot to speak to a live customer service rep and was just going to buy a second grill so my parents had theirs sometime during the summer season and would return or refuse delivery when the mysterious grill was actually delivered (probably sometime in November). He called ""someone"" at the distribution center??? The grill was guaranteed to be delivered today 6/11 so I didn't purchase the grill to take home. Guess what? No grill. Not sure why I'm wasting my time on hold with customer ""unservice"" for the third time....so far 55 minutes.I guess I just want some good quotes for my review or to listen to their response to Covid social distancing tape that I've heard probably about 150 times so far. Their stores are closing at 8 to restock and clean and sneeze into your arm, stay 6 feet apart. Great, where's my grill??Do not waste your time and money at Home Depot. Go to Lowes.They don't follow through on anything and their customer service is non-existent. GO TO LOWES3rd call follow up (after 55 minutes): The nice Georgian customer service rep told me that she does not know where my grill is, cannot tell me when it's coming, that I cannot cancel and that the rep in the local store completely lied when he told me he called the distribution center and that the grill was coming on June 11.

The Home Depot,Their delivery contractor TEMCO Logistics is broken,"I had a compact dryer delivered after purchasing it from Home Depot. I purchased on line and paid special attention to order the ""stacking kit"", new plug and venting as instructed so that the delivery team would install the dryer ""for free"". The Home Depot invoice indicated ""Stacking Laundry Install"" was included and planned. I also paid $25 extra to have the old dryer hauled away. The Good: The Temco team of two showed up on time.The Bad: They immediately refused to install the dryer saying something about they didn't want to damage the underlying washer. They refused to take the old dryer because they said they could damage the underlying washer. I explained that the dryer was unbolted and unplugged and all they had to do was lift it off and remove it. With great reluctance one of the two men, by himself, easily lifted it off and plopped it on his hand truck in about 10 seconds.

I paid out right for my appliances (matching over the stove microwave, stove, fridge) in the beginning of MAY and I only have my stove. They decided to call and tell me the day BEFORE delivery on May 30th that my fridge is on back order until the 20th of June. WHY WOULD THEY LET ME ORDER IT AND PAY FOR IT IF IT WAS OUT OF STOCK!?!? Well they brought my microwave and it was 100% damaged with half the installation parts missing and now they want to tell me my replacement is on back order now!? How are they a professional business!? I’m so livid right now. So because if them I had to pay extra money for a freezer compatible mini fridge and basic microwave which was more money out of my pocket making us flat broke and I can hardly keep any food in this house because of them and with a growing toddler who eats non stop this is making life 100% difficult",0,1

The Home Depot,Never order online!,"I wanted to purchase several items, in quantity. You think a company would want business... not true with Home Depot. They really dont give a $h1t! I had to carefully shop the store location and items to ensure it was all in stock for the order to go through. They changed the delivery date on me without ANY type of notice, costing me a day of work and ruining my weekend. But I then called to ADD to the order and was told that wasnt possible since my items were already set aside for delivery. So then the following Monday they pulled another stunt. They moved the date AGAIN, costing me ANOTHER day of work!!! And again, no notice or warning at all!! So I call up and spend hours on hold, listening to their stupid recording hundreds of times. Then the phone just disconnects!! I call the store and eventually get a manager. As soon as I start explaining the guy says ""want my corporate number?"" As if that would be of use... It is against Federal Law to charge someone for a delivery order then sell the material to someone else! Its different if a company doesnt charge you until it ships. So Home Depot wanted my money in they bank while they sold my stuff to someone else jacking me around. Evil scumbags. You CANT cancel the order online!!! You have to call to cancel and they put you through a nightmare of wasted hours to do that. The order got cancelled and now I still have the problem I was going to fix, lost 2 days of work, blown weekend, hours on hold. This is starting to feel like Soviet Era Russia waiting in line for toilet paper. I will never give home depot another dime. I shopped there often. Now they are scum.",0,1

Later we receive a call from the clerk saying, sorry the refrigerator was not delivered, because they don’t deliver in our area on Saturday! Very poor customer relations!

There's NOTHING Home Depot can do?!!! So here's why I am SO upset:1) I've called Build.com & Houzz to fix online orders within 12 hours. THEY were able to call their vendors & cancel - no problem!2) I picked up an online Lowe's order yesterday OUTSIDE - without a hitch!3) I've ALREADY got returns from a messed up HD online order placed May 5, 2020!4) I need a heat gun today!! I can order a heat gun online @ Lowe's (NOT the gun I wanted but...) and pick it up today.5) We're immuno-compromised!!! I don't WANT to go into Home Depot Store to return stuff when their system has messed up another order!

There is no other way to contact Home Depot except by phone. Expect to spend at least an hour waiting for a human. The person who finally answered was clueless. I was told to wait another 1-2 weeks! This is unacceptable. I emailed HD for a resolution to the problem (found an email to them through PayPal) and no one has responded. HD also won't allow posting of negative reviews to their site so don't bother airing your grievances.Update: My third call to HD had someone answer after about 20 mins. After discussing the slipcover issue they indicated that I would get a store credit for the slipcovers and that I could use that credit to order slipcovers directly from their website, which I did. The slipcovers arrived a week later on July 3. After a two month wait since my order on May 6 I can now use the outdoor chairs.

Yesterday, a cashier, who was not wearing a mask, approached within 3 feet of me. I've been trying to avoid spreading and getting the virus, and shutting down the economy again. The cashier did not appear to understand the importance of this. I talked to the manager, who was not wearing a mask and walked right up to me. They don't get it. Corporate has installed all the plexiglass and distancing signs, but they are disregarded. The stores are crowded and aisles constricted with sales displays.

So still no stove to cook with. Called the HD where I purchased it & all they could say was to talk to the delivery service. They checked & said they didn’t show that the call the day before didn’t show as being made.

Well I was called 3 hours prior to my scheduled delivery time because there were other customers that cancelled delivery on my same delivery day. They contacted the corporate office and the corporate office tried to force me to reschedule my delivery although it wasn’t my fault. In speaking with Forward Aire manager on duty in Raleigh, NC, he offered to deliver himself but would not install my washer and dryer. After being on the phone stating this was not my error they still tried to force a reschedule. I then decided to contact Home Depot and they managed to have Forward Aire deliver my washer and dryer on the schedule day and time. The two gentlemen that did deliver and install my washer and dryer were professional and nice but I feel for them as they get the bad end of the stick since the dispatch department for Forward Aire aren’t on the same page with them and this is a bad representation of Home Depot as a whole.

So I called back and again put on hold and they said my order was pushed back again for another 2 weeks. And there is nothing they could do about it.

Beeping like crazy I had 2 visits and the the door just fell off, damaged the floor and crashed. I wish I could post pictures. GE will not replace it. They are sending parts to me in bits and pieces. I have had about 15 deliveries of big boxes, little boxes, little envelopes, big envelopes. Of all kind of parts. 5th visit coming up for this piece of junk",0,5
The Home Depot,Fraud at Lees Summit Home Depot,Went to Home Depot last night to buy a dryer. Tried to decide between two and the salesperson pushed us towards one which we went with. We added the warranty but after we got the total it ended up being way more so I asked for it to be removed and the salesperson said they would take it off. The total went down and we paid and left. Dryer would not be available for 2 weeks. I kept thinking about this all night and got my paperwork out and was stunned. Initially when the total was so high it turns out they did not take off the discount as the dryer was on sale. When I asked for the warranty to be removed he didn’t do it he took off the discount and charged us $90 for the warranty. I called the next day and the manager Adrian said he could refund the $90 and clearly it was no big dig we had been fraudulently charged. I later got a call from the appliance manager saying they could not refund the warranty charge until after the delivery in Reno weeks. No one cares that there employee tries to pull one over and that is probably not the first time. Needless to say I just cancelled the whole thing. NEVER AGAIN WITH THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE STEALING,0,1

Seeing that we drkvd an hour to get it she still did not try to rectify or make situation any better just continued to be rude. We've been treated better at Lowe's, guessing that's where we will go.

The Home Depot,One Star,"One Star, and that's being extremely generous. I ordered an electric pressure washer on the home depot online. I found the item and started to do the check out process. I checked the box to have it home delivered. I accepted the fees for the shipping and paid through PayPal the total amount, including the shipping fee. Clicked on ""print receipt"" and immediately noted that it has store pick up with the home depot's store address (The store it was being shipped too, was not in my neighborhood. I have to drive past two other home depot stores to get to the store where the item was being sent. I wasted no time calling customer service. Due to the Covid-19, I expected a delay in getting a customer service agent. That is new normal that we all have to get used too. The automated phone computer voice stated that it would be 20 minutes hold time. I ended up having to wait 92 minutes (of course on a speaker as I did other things, waiting). When the customer service agent answered, I started by introducing myself, and I asked the lady's name as I always do with anyone relating to customer service for my notes. (years of experience in dealing with over the phone customer service agents) Unfortunately, she refused and told me that she does not have to give me her name. I asked her again and stated that I must insist. I said that just in case I needed to provide my timeline of who I had spoken before too to another person if necessary. However, she did not want to do that and hung up me (oh, in her defense, right before the line went dead, she did tell me to have a nice day). I called again and had to wait an additional 74 minutes. And once again, when the customer service agent answered, I asked for her name, She replied with the same greeting that she had done initially when she answered the call, ""Thank you for calling Home Depot, how may I help you."" Being that I am a stubborn old fool. I asked again, and finally, she gave me her name. I explain my situation, and she tells me to (And this, is no lie. Incredibly enough, it actually happened) Sir, you have 30 minutes after the order was completed to contact us to correct anything wrong with the order, and since it has been over 2 in half hours since you made the order, there's nothing I can do. You'll just have to suck it up"". If I want to cancel the order, I'll have to wait when it arrives at the store, 15 days later, and I can go into the store and request a cancel order. I can say with 100% certainty that I will never use the home depot online ever again. This was my first time with home depot, and it will be my last. I usually use Lowes for online shopping and never had issues like this. That was my experience with Home Depot Online shopping.",0,1

The Home Depot,Worst online shopping experience ever,"I haven't had a bad experience shopping in store at Home Depot but I don't think I've ever had such a bad online shopping experience as my recent one with Home Depot. I ordered an office chair from them 7 weeks ago because I am working from home. The chair was meant to arrive at my local store for pick up a week later. It never did. The tool to check the status of my order never updated the delivery date or any info from the original expected delivery date. Each time I tried to call to find out info, my hold times varied between 30 minutes and 50 minutes. The first time I called, I waited 35 minutes only for someone to hang up on me right after picking up the call. I had spent so long choosing the chair, I didn't want to just cancel the order and order a chair somewhere else. I called a few days later and the lady said she couldn't help me but she would escalate the issue and I would hear from someone who could. That was 2 weeks ago- surprise surprise, I never heard back from them again. When I tried to cancel the order, I had to wait 50 minutes to speak to someone to cancel it and was still not able to cancel it (I couldn't cancel online because the cancellation window had ended hah!). I understand these are unusual times but this is obscene.Update on 27 July 2020- Ireceived an email from Home Depot saying that they have shipped my order to the store for pickup. Who knows how long it will take to sort this out. I won't be shopping at Home Depot anymore.",0,1

All in the course of a day. There was absolutely no notification as to it being on sale or send it to sort of promotion or I would have purchased it sooner. I called customer service and was treated very rudely and was offered absolutely nothing to help correct the issue. Clearly these people were leaving work and wanted to get out. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold indefinitely calling back a second time at 11:45 I got the same treatmentand again asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold again indefinitely. I called at midnight I'm conveniently got a recording that they were closed.

The worst thing however was when I did a review about the product on their site so others didn't get burned they removed it twice! It was tactful as well, being fully aware they would have a reason to remove it if it had been foul. So be very skeptical about any reviews on THEIR site. They manipulate them and remove negative ones they don't like instead of letting them up and responding to the problem. They are also a joke with the Covid issue . . . cattle shutes out front, standing in line outside waiting to get in. I switched to Lowes. Distancing but not the rest of the knee-jerk BS.

On my 5th attempt I finally got through, but now I'm told the appliance is backordered until June 10-15ish, and I still don't have a delivery date.

The Home Depot,SAFE OR SORRY? OR JUST DONT CARE.,"Went to home Depot several times in the last month, and most of the time had to wait outside in line due to checking mask,allowing a certain amount of people inside Etc... But today, I went and waited outside, hot of course, but understandably for safety reasons. I go inside the store n within 5 mins,I see not one or two, but FIVE employees walking around without their masks and/or actually hanging from their face. One employee who works in the hardware department with Jigsaw, skill saws, Etc... who had on a purple shirt, was wearing no mask whatsoever, but dressed in civilian clothes so he wouldn't be pegged as an employee. He was obviously a Home Depot employee because he was asking if he could help others, which is a good thing, but the mask thing? NOT so good. I then went to check out,and saw two other employees w/o mask. Well,""I am now so annoyed"", I took pictures to show the manager,who I think I found. He identified himself as the manager w/o verbally giving me his name. I saw no I.D, no identifying items from H.D. n so forth, for all I know he could be a vendor. He was just a blonde goateed guy, who did not like when I asked him if we are required to wear a mask before we enter the store?, he kept asking me ""why are you asking me this""?"" (I found that strange, all he had to do was say yes or no. He acted as if it's happened before n did not want to incriminate himself.) I asked him to please answer my question, are we required to wear a mask before we enter your store? ""I mean they have the biggest ass sign in the entrance n exit so I'm not sure why he questioned me on that"", he finally answers yes? I then asked him, why do you have five employees running around without a mask on? He didn't answer me until I showed him the picture, N THE ONLY answer I get IS (he'd handle it.) (If I had a dime for every person that said that to me, I'd be a rich person.) So I waited around the corner n he NEVER made a move n I was there for only 3 or 4 minutes, I'm not going to act like 20/20 n sneak around. If he'd ""Handled it"" THEN n not allow a possible 100 or more get possibly infected, I wouldn't of made it an issue, and also the PUBLIC, deserves to know this.The most aggravating thing is the picture I took of two ladies by the checkout area in front of the lumber where they are in contact w EVERY customer that checks out. if this ""manager"" who said he was the manager would have instantly went and corrected the situation, I most likely wouldn't be putting in this review, but he was sarcastic and never made any eye contact with me, just kept staring straight at his register while I spoke to him n barely even looked at the pictures. so guys stand up for your rights, we don't have many left hardly anymore just laws and rules, some make sense, and some don't, but in this case? It's called COMMON SENSE and (whats good for the goose is good for the gander) if you're gonna make the rules, then you should be the first to follow them. So guys, if they are going to make you stand outside for ""safety reasons""and you see an employee there or anywhere or ANYONE jeopardizing your life by having their mask off, SAY SOMETHING!! Thank you for your patience n have a great day.😷",0,1

The line to check out was through the front of the store wrapping around. There were 2 registers opened. It was insane that they did not call other associates up front to the registers. Finally, I got to one of the open u-scan registers. I could not leave because there was an open register with someone there blocking the way. The cashier could not scan 2 of his items due to there were no tag codes to scan. Really poor customer service. There were 2 men buying air conditioners. I think they left when they saw the line.

The Home Depot,I ordered a Ryobi Edger/Trimmer from…,"I ordered a Ryobi Edger/Trimmer from HomeDepot.com.For some reason, it moved my order to the Harper Woods, MI store, where it was NOT in stock, instead of 2 other stores, in Roseville and Warren, where it was and still IS in stock.This was something on their website.In addition, since they were coming to drop that off, I ordered 7 bags of dirt.Totals:RYOBI 40-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Attachment Capable String Trimmer with 4.0 Ah Battery and Charger IncludedQty: 1$139.00Scotts Premium 0.75 cu. ft. Top soilQty: 7$1.57/item$10.99Payment DetailsSubtotal $211.73Scheduled Delivery $8.99Sales Tax $13.24Order Total $233.96Their Delivery Charge was $8.99. The system verified everything was coming. I'd never have paid $8.99 for any delivery of dirt if I'd known they were out of the trimmer, but they didn't give me that option.So even tho this order was verified and the delivery guy was on his way to bring it, I received a Voicemail at 1:47PM on May 18 telling me the delivery guy didn't get or maybe they were out of the Trimmer.They did not ask if I wanted to cancel.They said delivery driver was ""on his way"".I have this Voicemail.10 min. later, they delivered 7 bags of dirt.NO Ryobi Edger.I have the security video from beginning to end of this delivery, you can see there isn't one in his truck, he never brings up a large, green edger. He sticks the full receipt in with the bags of dirt.I was in bed at this time. I'm disabled but I was also sick with Coronavirus, my SO went down, saw immediately edger was missing, guy in truck drove away while he was standing there.He, Chris, called the store after trimmer didn't show up, took 45 min. to get someone on phone, they said it would be refunded. Driver left receipt for the 7 bags of dirt and the trimmer, there was NO trimmer.Well I was charged. I have created a file of the entire 3 min. of this delivery: TRACKING NUMBER 98F2 - 087C - E30B - 4866DRIVER Marcus G. (Green Pickup Truck) dropping off ONLY 7 bags of dirt and NO Ryobi Edger/Trimmer. Tho he left the entire receipt instead of marking that it wasn't there or they were out of it or he didn't deliver it. I have the full video if you need it. I also have the Voicemail left by the Harper Woods Home Depot saying I'd not be charged.We have called the store, they said it would be refunded. I used their email CSR, the response was: ""Thank you for your email to Customer Care at The Home Depot. To answer your question more quickly, we ask that you please call 1-800-HOME-DEPOT (466-3337) with your inquiry, as this inbox is not currently being actively monitored."" We did not receive the Ryobi edger. We were charged for it and the tax.Total refund should be $147.34I have disputed it thru PayPal, where I paid from. Home Depot has not answered them.I need an Edger, I can't afford one until I get my money back. Alternatively, Home Depot should have delivered this Ryobi Trimmer from a store that did have it in stock, there's 2 others nearby that have it. And given me the chance to cancel so I didn't have to pay an $8.99 delivery charge.My card should not have been charged in the first place.Here is the entire video of this delivery. I also have the voicemail from the store 10 min. prior stating I would not be charged for the missing edger.",0,1

Unfortunately for me, I ordered something and immediately wanted to cancel as I mistakenly ordered the wrong size (garden shed). I tried for TWO WEEKS to get a hold of someone to cancel this order, and NEVER got a hold of anyone. I finally realized the store is open and went into Home Depot today and got told I can’t do anything until I get the item and then have to return it. I thought it was being delivered curb side at the store which was fine, I then get home and see they have delivered my ten foot shed to my house....that I never even wanted!!! To return this to the store will be a nightmare as my vehicle will not hold this. And now I’m stuck with this stupid shed!! All it would have taken was a simple cancel or change order at my order confirmation page but that is not available and you’re supposed to call them but no one answers the phone!!! I understand this is a special situation with COVID, but get your online purchase processes in check. And I know it’s my fault I accidentally ordered the wrong size but now I’m stuck with this shed I DO NOT WANT! And now a bill that is just ridiculous.

I waited at home all day for it and called to find out that in the system it showed that it was actually delivered and signed by someone that we don’t even know.

No if I wanted to pick up items at the store I would not have paid $79 for Express Delivery.

The Home Depot,Terrible experience online,"I ordered a twin size bed frame from Home Depot for my daughter on April 29th. Her birthday was May 14th, and the guaranteed arrival date was May 11th, so I thought we were safe in ordering this. Other items we ordered from different online retailers were the twin size mattress, sheets, quilt and pillows. Everything arrived as expected, MINUS the bed frame. On May 11th the ""guaranteed arrival date"" changed to May 14th. On May 14th the online order status showed processing, not even shipped. I raced to the nearest city with an Ashley Furniture (2 hours away) in order to get a bed so that we could continue with my daughter's birthday surprise. The thing that makes me most angry about this whole deal is that I have called various times to customer service and waited close to an hour to be connected each time -- and have been told the same story ""your order is processing, we cannot cancel the order because it is outside of the cancelation window."" Therefore, I am still being charged for a bed that has not shown up. Today is May 19th and the guaranteed arrival date is still showing May 14th, and the item is still ""processing"". Why can they not cancel my order already? I bought a bed elsewhere! Save yourself the shipping cost and the hassle of me having to return the thing! There is no FedEx in my town, so I'd be facing another 2 hour drive to drop the thing off to return it if it actually arrives some day...",0,1

I went to the store and the dingleberries there had no clue what to do and said I just had to wait and that the order had not shipped. I said, yes it did, because I got some of the order but not all of it. They are WORTHLESS. The stores are unable to help you and the online support is HORRIBLE. It would be so much easier if you could reply to the order email or if they had a simple email address so we could explain the problem and get support later, the next day, or whatever instead of wasting my GD time on the GD phone!

The Home Depot,Bad Service and Wont Refund my Money,"I have had a problem with home depot since May 1st of 2020. I came to the store to look for a washer and dryer for Mother's Day and pick out the one for her now I usually don't deal with home depot for stuff like this because of your ratings and yes I read all reviews before purchasing anything from a store. So I purchased a washer and dryer from the home depot because she said she wanted it from there because it was close to home. I was very leary but that was where she wanted so I went. Purchased the MVWB765FW washer @642.00 and MGDB765FW dryer @ 753.00 with a 10 % discount on appliances @ 396.00. So they never checked to make sure the product was in stock when I paid the money. They sent me an email on May 8th stating that the dryer was not available until Saturday, July 18th which I thought was ridiculous so I went to home depot and asked them why so long for the dryer they never told my mom that the would have to build a whole new dryer because they were out of the one she wanted. So I tried calling a couple of times just to get hung up on which is very disrespectful at any given time. When I got to the store they had already talked with someone through customer service so they were gonna upgrade her to the newer model which was fine at the price we already paid for. So when salesperson Janette JJA6MYQ called back to find out if they were gonna still give me the deal they said o.k but when went to the Manager who was on Duty that day of May 11th he didn't want to do it so I had to pay for an upgrade and to redo the whole transaction over with me owing them 166.43 which I paid since she was getting the upgrade.Low and behold the day of delivery they come with the color of white which should have been Metallic slate what I paid for. It was just too much to deal with at the time so I went up to the store and asked for the manager named Jo who never since the whole process has begun to come and say well I'm sorry this keeps happening and that we will do this for you for your time coming up here just nothing wouldn't even show his face which I think is bad customer service for him and the entire store. But the delivery guys were awesome. Juan C. Morales and Jose' Flores very respectful gentlemen. These other salespersons are very nasty and rude JJA6MYQ- Janette and CBM20C - Sally also ALI6R4Q- Ariel. Order No. H1911-222409. I will never ever purchase anything as long as I'm living and breathing from Home Depot store number 1911 Cicero, Il ever again. All I want is my money back from the upgrade and you will never hear from me again and if I don't receive it I will take you to small claims court over it. I work too hard for my money and to be treated this way is unheard of. This will also go on your reviews so that you know how your employees are ""UNBELIEVABLE""Patricia Coleman",0,1

Kinda like running a gauntlet going down the aisles...and you can’t tell me it was because they were understaffed, not with so many employees standing around.We were looking for something else a little later and I said, “excuse me sir” to an employee and he turned around and looked at me for a split second and then walked into the lunch room.A couple years ago the employees were so helpful that it was almost annoying.

The Home Depot,Home Depot and Lowe's Comparison,"I shop at both Lowe's and Home Depot. I trust both stores to carry many items that I want at good prices. I like them both for different reasons at different times.They are both very similar but there are differences. I always look up items online before going to either store. One will sell something that I want for much less than the other. It doesn't matter if it is a low dollar item or a high value item. They will carry very similar products but the prices for those products will vary a lot between the two stores. Then, they vary slightly with what they offer. One might have something in the quantity that I want while the other will not. One might have a color or design that I prefer. Lowe's had landscape fabric pins for less than at Home Depot. Home Depot had vinyl sheeting flooring for less than Lowe's. With the flooring comparison, Lowe's does not carry TrafficMaster. I checked reviews online and TrafficMaster is quite similar to Congoleum which Lowe's does carry. I did have a problem with my local Home Depot store when I purchased my range. They had the best price but it was a floor model. Since it was a floor model, they were going to charge me for delivery and for installation. I found out that I could order it online, not a floor model, for the same price and have it delivered and setup for free. I didn't try to buy a floor model appliance at Lowe's. They had the best price for the type of refrigerator that I wanted and they delivered for free.I really like both stores but I think that you need to check online before shopping at either store.",0,5

The Home Depot,Very Disappointed with Home Depot,"March 31, 2020 I bought a Whirlpool refrigerator at Home Depot, the refrigerator was delivered on April 9 and the person who made the delivery said that we should wait 3 days for it to cool down well, but I kept waiting for one more day and it didn't cool down.I decided to go to Home Depot and claim and a representative indicated that I should submit my claim directly to Whirlpool since Home Depot did not make returns.I called Whirlpool many times to request the change and they told me that by policy they did not make changes but that they would send me a technician, (I was already in the second week without a refrigerator,) The technician reviewed the problem and it was lack of gas. Three days later I called and they told me that the repair area was closed and that I should call again. after two weeks of waiting they sent me to the technician with the new part, it took me more than three hours to say that they finally approved to send me a new refrigerator, (after a month of waiting)Unfortunately I didn't know about Home Depot's return policy and the quality of care they give their customers is the worst, starting with the store manager who didn't care about my problem and made me feel like I was a thief.I transmit this experience so that they decide well where to buy.Lowe's accepts return of failed appliances seamlessly,",0,1

A price mistake on Home Depots website is an error on Home Depot and they should honor the price they have posted. I should get the floors for the price I paid. We went back and forth and she told me the same stuff over and over, never helping. ""Home Depot strives for 100% satisfaction and accuracy but sometimes it just can't be done"". I was eventually HUNG UP on by KIM. I never raised my voice or cussed. I am just trying to get what i paid for. This is not my mistake, it's Home Depots and they should own up to their mistake and make it right. They have it posted on their site that they honor price adjustments, that's a lie. I just want what i ordered for the price I originally ordered them for.",0,1
The Home Depot,There IS No Home Depot Customer…,"There IS No Home Depot Customer Service! I ordered some plants from our local Home Depot which was supposed to be sent by the plant supplier. That was on April 20th. The plants were supposed to be here on the 29th, then May 5th, and now they have vanished into cyberspace. I have tried three times to contact Home Depot Customer service. How many people do they have there answering phones? Three? I waited 25 minutes the first time, 35 minutes the second time, and 58 minutes the third time...all with no one answering the phone. I have tracked the order and it was shipped by the plant supplier, then they just vanished. I finally wrote a letter to my local Home Depot to see if they would just cancel my order and refund my money. I don't hold out too much hope, though!",0,1

The Home Depot,NIGHTMARISH experience - will never patronize again,"Went 2 HD 2 buy carpet & pvc board. PVC board - helped by ""Junior"" who deserves 5 stars. Then, I look 4 almost 15 mins 2 find help in carpet. Finally found a woman who sd person working that dept was on lunch but shd be back soon. REALLY???? Sd I wd not wait 4 an employee 2 get back from lunch. She reluctantly paged someone. Headed back 2 carpet. A few mins later, Todd started walking my direction. I asked if he was headed 2 carpet. He gave me a dirty look rolled his eyes, & asked rudely ""do you want something?"" I decided 2 overlook this & go ahead & accompany him 2 carpet. Once there, told him I what I wanted. Had purchased this item here b4. His sd he didn't think they hd in stock. I sd web shows they have 197. Finally, I went over 2 the rolls of carpet, looked up & pointed 2 the product. I sd ""it is right there, you just need to roll it down."" I was not rude or sarcastic in any way - just trying to point out they did have product. He was not happy. He rolled it down & asked how much I needed - I sd two 14' sections. He asked how wide I wanted (hello - it only comes in 12' widths) & I sd 12'. He sd he was sure they didn't have enough. It was clear there was at least enough 4 one 14' section. He argued he didn't think there was enough. Finally I sd ""can we just measure it out & see if U you have enough 4 at least 14'?"" Very reluctantly, he began loading into the measuring/cutting device. Another employee came 2 assist (he was polite unlike Todd). They measured the first 14' & started wrapping it. I asked if he cd only wrap the ends instead of the whole thing b/c I would need to fold in half, and Todd turned & gave me the nastiest look you can imagine. He sd it was easy 2 fold & showed by folding one section. I sd ""honey that's fine 4 U, but I am not strong (I am also disabled, but did not feel it necessary 2 tell him that) & it would be easier 4 me 2 manage if you left the middle untaped (how hard is that?). He glared at me. The other employee stepped in & sd he wd tape the other end. Todd proceeded 2 throw it on my cart (reg cart-not lumber cart) w/o folding in half. I had to fold it in half - then b/c it was only 1/3 in the cart, I had 2 try 2 lift it on top & hurt my back in the process (the plastic ""wrapping"" clings 2 cart-doesn't slide). Asked 4 help-Todd ignored me-other employee helped get it on top of cart. I sd it was clear there was not another 14' of this color, but they did have blue in stock, so asked for 14' of blue. When Todd was totaling $, I asked 4 verification it was $168. I mentioned the .50 per ft & Todd snapped back ""we don't sell by the foot, only by the yard."" I told him that price per ft & price per yd are listed. He sd the per foot is just 4 your info. I sd you don't have to be a mathematical genius 2 know that price per sq ft & price per sq yd calculate the same (by now I had completely lost my patience w/his rudeness). I told him that he hd been a total jerk since he came to ""assist' me. He sd I had told everyone in the store how to do their job. I sd I only spoke to 1 other employee 4 help & he was polite. He then threatened me & sd ""irrational behavior is a symptom of COVID19 & we have a right to refuse svc to anyone we suspect of having COVID 19."" On my way 2 check out, I asked another employee 2 get me the store mgr. The asst mgr (store mgr not on duty) came 2 the front. I explained what happened & told him I wd likely never again shop at HD. Of course, he was apologetic & sd this was not like Todd at all (although one of several employees I spoke 2 outside when loading my car sd""that's just like Todd."" Clearly Todd needs 2 give his job 2 someone who really wants it. Neither Todd nor the woman I asked 4 help know what customer service is. In my over 40 years of being a consumer, this is, hands down, the ABSOLUTE WORST experience I have ever had AT ANY retailer. It takes a lot 4 me 2 complain 2 a manager & even more 4 me 2 post a neg review. Take that how U want.",0,1
The Home Depot,Terrible service,"Terrible service, one of the worst services ever experienced. The customer service doesn't care about the customer's needs at all. They are rude and very unprofessional, kind of like morons. I ordered paint from their website but there is no place to choose the color. Later, I called them to choose colors but the customer service says that if I ordered a paint from online, I cannot pick color!!! What the hell will be the use of the paint if I cannot choose color! They say I have to go into their store to pick the color myself. Then why should I order this stuff and wait for curb-side pickup? It is Covid-19 situation, and no body wants to go into the store to pick up the color. I asked the customer service to help to solve this issue because what they said is that online order of paint is practically useless. The customer service started to talk in a rude way about ""we have been working hard, we have lots of issues, we.."" blah blah blah. Then I pointed out that, Lowe's, Canadian tires, Rona all are facing Covid-19 and have the same issues as you did, why could they do a much better job? (Lowe's will call the customer to pick the color for their paint!!!) Then the customer service said nothing about being sorry but keep being rude as if they are the boss and can set up whatever rule they want... I would never buy stuffs from them again.",0,1

Well it’s 5 days later and I’ve received notice that the pressure washer has shipped to be received on the 13th of May. The item for pick up is “still being processed.” I’ve tried calling but refuse to hold longer than 5 minutes. I am a disabled senior and the web site made it seem as if “on line order and curb pickup” were the way to go. This store has always had the worst customer service but at least before the pandemic some of them did try to be more courteous.

The Home Depot,Worst on Line CS EVER in my LIFE!,"An almost $3,000 purchase and we have been treated like trash!My husband and I ordered the Hampton Bay Beacon Park Wicker Patio Sectional Sofa with Sunbrella Cushions along with the Lounge chairs and cushions, Ottoman and cushions, and Swivel Chair with cushions. The Swivel Chair is still on back order with no idea when it will be in stock.Of course, everything came in different boxes, and the Sunbrella cushion covers were not labeled as to what went together. Neither did the directions state anything. But most of it wasn't difficult to figure out. However, one (1) particular cushion cover came separately and didn't fit ANYTHING! It seemed to be that the only cushion left was for it to fit on was the ottoman cushion.Upon contacting the on-line CS, and sending pictures of how this cushion cover DID NOT FIT the ottoman cushion, I was sent 4 separate emails with various instructions explaining how I should stuff this far too large cushion in to this much smaller cover. Their reasoning for this was that the ""tag"" on the outside of the cover had the correct numbers and therefore was the right cover for the cushion. Never mind that it was obvious that the cover was far to large for the cushion as was plainly obvious.The final email I received from the on-line CS was that I was out of options and there was nothing more that could be done as returning the item and requesting a replacement would do no good as the replacement would just be the same as what I already had in my possession. I took the items into a Home Depot store and physically showed a CS person the items. She could not believe what the on line reps had said to me and immediately got them on the phone. She was told the EXACT SAME THING! However, they did tell her to offer me a $100 on-line credit for my troubles.WHAT?! That was INSULTING!!!She then got the store manager for me. He was also shocked at such poor CS from the Home Depot on line service and offered me $100 credit in his store. It is amazing that such a simple thing can be blown up to be such a huge problem by such stupid people at Home Depot with such poor problem solving skills.At this point we are ready to have Home Depot on-line come pick up the entire purchase at their expense with their ""on-line credit"" to us.We will NOT be ordering another item EVER AGAIN from HOME DEPOT and letting EVERYONE we know what a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE we had!",0,1
The Home Depot,Worst Online Order Experience,"At this point, I wouldn't even give Home Depot 1 star. This has been the worst online order experience I have ever had. I order 8 pieces of red cedar wood and a box of screws to build a raised garden box. The wood was ready but not the screws. However, when I picked up the wood, there was so many cracks and splinters in it. Don't claim that you are giving the best experience for your customers when you are giving them terrible product. I phoned to complain about the wood and it's been over 2 weeks now, still haven't heard back. At the 1 1/2 week mark, I checked my order status of the box of screws. Wasn't even in transit yet. However, when I checked online order, it was in stock at my pick up store? How does that make any sense? I am waiting for a product that is already at the store. So I texted customer service since I clearly wasn't going to get a response on the phone. It said a representative will be in contact within 72 hours. 5 days later, clearly more than 72 hours, the representative texts me on Mother's Day. Like are you kidding me? It's Mother's Day???? I had left a description before hand including my order number, the product and everything. But because I didn't answer right away, the chat was ended. When I messaged back, I now have to wait 5 DAYS!?!?! After this experience, I will never again shop at Home Depot. This is the most ridiculous online order experience I have ever dealt with. Using Covid 19 at this point is an excuse since other multiple large companies have been able to readjust to the circumstances. There seems to be no care for the customers anymore. For such a large company, this is outrageous.",0,1

The check out person said come anytime Thursday to pick it up. My son w et Thursday around four. A woman called me while he was waiting. The grill was not ready but assemblers were coming on Friday so for sure it would be ready. OkSo Friday around four I call to find out it it is ready. I called the number for customer. I told the person who answered after a 15 min hold I wanted to know if grillwas ready. She told there are only three people working customer service and she does not have time to help me call back later. I then called the 800 customer service spoke to Matt who could not have been nicer. He put me on hold came back some time later and told she told him same thing. There are thousands of people out of work why is Home Depot short handed and why does that woman have a job. She bullied this senior citizen. I paid for the grill - I do not have it and no one will tell what is going on. Is this theft? How do they get away with this. Seniors have enough to deal with without being bullied. I have 5 adult children between them they have 14 children I wonder if each of them told someone how I am being treated how many customers Home Depot would lose.

The Home Depot,I placed a fairly large order online…,I placed a fairly large order online for a home remodel project. I selected to pay additional $90 to make sure I receive on time. I know due to COVID-19 things are not exactly normal. The day I was suppose to receive shipment i receive an email saying shipment is delayed. I went LOCAL lumber company to purchase what i needed to for project. I called HD customer service waited 48 minutes on hold until reaching a representative. I explained I would like to cancel order and he replied it is past the cutoff but since I did wait on hold he would make an exception and cancel order. I would receive an email of cancellation. Well 72 hours later no email but I did receive another email stating my current order is delayed 2-3 weeks. So once again I wait 45 minutes on hold only for the system to disconnect me and had to call back and now on hold for 51 minutes and still waiting.

The Home Depot,Be ready for a headache,"I received emails starting parts of my order were ready for pickup and then I was told no they’re not ready by a store associate.

While canceling the item on my order the store associate released part of my order and when I asked who released the items she lied and said the online customer service and there’s nothing she can do about it and that I would need to call online customer service to sort it out. I ended up having to go into the store to sort it out and found out that it was the same associate that cancelled the item and released part of my order. I was then told by the store associates sorting out the previous associates mistakes that all of my items will be ready for pick up on May 4th. I arrive on May 4th only to wait over 2 hours to pick up my items. Nobody knew where any of the items I had ordered were. Then once I got home and started to unbox my cabinets and countertops that I had waited weeks for the cabinets were of the poorest quality. The cabinets were broken, bent, and needed repair before they could even be installed. The 8 ft countertops were completely unusable because they were split down the center, chipped, and broken. I went back up to the store and spoke with the store manager at this point and he acted like it’s no big deal and only offered to pick up the countertops and refund me for them.

No notice to me of the change...only the notice the order was out for delivery. If order was small enough to fit in my car would cancel it and go to the store and save the $75 delivery charge!",0,1

Then i went to pick it up and was told I had to wait 3 days or more to pick up one little item so we could take showers in our house.

The Home Depot,Carmella,"I wouldn’t give it a one star but I have to write a review. Customer service at the store is terrible. Ive had an awful time trying to order a shower stall and shower doors , I advise the cler at the store I’m ordering from that I’m getting frustrated, her comment was “do you want a confrontation or do you want to order? I didn’t say what I wanted, to say . Customer service on the phone is terrible. Nothing good to say. My experience is too long to explain. In short I’m getting charged for 2 sets of shower doors being shipped to my home , I only wanted 1 set , called to cancel 1 set , was told had to do that 45 minutes after I ordered, ( mind you won’t ship for 2 weeks) well the store tried, I tried could not get thru, too busy, I get that, but then the rules should change if your going to say it’s because of Covid-19 we are so busy, I bet you are . Bend the rules to help the customer. I know I can return it but I don’t want to pay shipping for I tried to cancel as soon as I ordered it. I will be canceling my credit card as soon as this order is completed and I will not shop at Home Depot again. I’m sure they don’t care but they may take notice when enough people have been treated as such",0,1
The Home Depot,"My review is for the home depot in…Batavia, New York","My review is for the home depot in Batavia, New York. Purchased a Cub Cadet zero turn lawn mower. Waited a good half hour for someone to help us after asking numerous times for assistance at customer service. Finally a girl named Savy got us some help. If it wasn't for her we would have waited way longer. After getting her help, we found out she was a new employee. Kudos to her. She really should be recognized for such great customer service. Also want to thank Mary our cashier. She was very knowledgeable. Also to Chris our first cashier, whom couldn't do checks so directed us to Mary.",0,3
The Home Depot,Terrible experience,"Called phone number on the online receipt. Was told to take security camera back to store for exchange. The apparent manager of service desk, told me I must bring back the other cameras and cables that were installed. Explained to her I cannot do that. She got angry and walked away. The other lady called someone and found a possible solution. I turned to walk out the in door, was stopped and told I must walk to other end of store and use the exit because of the virus. Told her that makes no sense and my truck is parked at this end of store. By this time a half a dozen employees are standing around staring at us. I got the impression they were going to physical stop me if I tried to go out the entrance door. As I turned to walk to the other end of store I walked by two of those employees and said this is bull!!!! . The big burly guy said “it is the same way at Lowe’s and Menards “ I called back it is not, he yells “ then don’t shop here” I yelled back you bet I won’t. This exchange with the guy was very upsetting. This is one of several times I’ve had bad experiences in Home Depot.",0,1

We decided to check the website and the order says on time still scheduled for delivery June 2nd. The product though said no longer available. Very confusing to say the least. We'd passed on another chest freezer because we liked the model that Home Depot had as backordered for the end of May. I called their online order number and waited over an hour to speak with a rep for clarification, with the hope that we would still receive our product and that the message just meant it was no longer available for anyone else to order. When I finally did reach someone, they looked at it with me and said that yes, it looks like the manufacturer didn't have any left and said he'd have to cancel the order. He said it would be a few days til we received the money back in our account though. The rep, rather than take the blame and apologize, felt it was necessary to blame it on the manufacturer and offered little in the way of an apology. What a horrendous experience and waste of our time while also keeping our funds unavailable to use for trying to find another freezer now that they have effectively left us in a very bad spot. Way to go! Now the other freezer is no longer available and we're out of luck.",0,1

Well, we were approved and no there was no $50 credit applied at check out. This resulted in multiple phone calls and two trips of 60 miles one way to the store. All we got was excuses and repeatedly told that we didn't have the proper coupon code. We deeply regret that there is a company such as this that take advantage of their customers with scams, bait and switch tactics. We hate that we had to give Home Depot a single star just to write a review, their policy and pass the buck customer service is a disgrace.

When I called the support I was lied to. They had told me I would get another one in the mail. I waited almost three weeks before calling back and they said they can't send them out and the last person told me incorrect information and transferred me to a department that can give codes. When I talked to them she said she might be able to help but I would have to wait 7-10 business days to find out. From looking at my account they can see I haven't used the promotion. I told them the email never worked. The customer service representative's response to me was,""Those are sent out to you as a courtesy."" I know, and I am trying to use it. They were no help!

While waiting we called the local store and they could not help - they actually call the same HD 800 that was on the onlibne receipt we received. The customer service department seems very understaffed. Once we reached a the customer service rep, the issue was resolved. Then the set was shipped in 3 different deliveries. In one of the assemblies, there was a part missing. We called back to the same 800 number and you guessed it, another 90 minutes wait. When they say that you wait will be longer that 10 minutes, expect 10x longer wait. Finally reached a customer service person. He took all my information and put me on hold to check with the factory. While waiting Home Depot cut off the call. I now have a third 90 minute wait for customer service. Home depot is ok for buying commodity products in the store.

Home Depot has extremely poor online execution and vendor accountability. Most small business would kill to have your business right now, and I am not referring to the contractors that work for Home Depot. Unfortunately, Home Depot is getting to stay open as an essential business while other local business offering same products have to be shut. Huge profits during COVID and Home Depot has poor customer service and an apathetic response to giving you poor service.Two times I have used online to buy from them-#1 - ordered an over the stove top microwave to be installed. Contractors were high, literally wearing sunglasses indoor to cover it up - didn't fool me from smell. They installed two out of four wall bolts, leaving the two most important bolts out, which literally had a safety label that said they must be installed to prevent serious injury. I had to pull the microwave off the wall when I realized it was leaning. I had a two year old at the time. Can't imagine if it fell on him. They did nothing in regards to follow up, but rather gave me a very apathetic response.#2 - ordered a grill from them online. Called in first time to cancel because it wasn't the right grill I wanted. After an hour on wait, I was told to call in once the vendor shipped it because they couldn't cancel. Called 2nd time, one hour wait again. They told me I was misinformed and to call once item is delivered then I can call again. Can't wait for the third time of an hour wait.Buy Amazon! Believe me.

The Home Depot,I think everyone needs to understand,"I think everyone needs to understand. Home Depot is not equipped for something of this sort. They have the same number of employees and at certain stores they have literally everyone who is healthy working at any given time in a shorter timeframe. Which means stocking, deliveries, getting into the store is going to be longer or more difficult. This while also trying to maintain the safety of their employees and customers isn’t a easy task. I am a contractor and have spoken with a few of the managers and their staff is exhausted and stressed. I think Home Depot is also wrong and should only have the essential sections open. Hey we are going to crowd the store due to people who want to get mulch and flowers during a pandemic is crazy. I hate the fact that we even have to send our employees there to stand in line for a hour shop for a hour then get back to their job sites. Unfortunately we are still being held to same timelines on projects and dc, md and va have labeled construction and renovation essential or something of that sort. Mask should be required in every Home Depot and they started doing it now at some of them but at any given time you will still have a crowd of people in the store when they aren’t monitoring. The other day I saw a man and woman come in with no mask on and picked up two flowers. Another lady was there with no mask with her child picking out paint colors. As I said I get the boredom and the little projects but having had 4 people I know pass away and 17 people I know including 3 children run 102 degree temperatures I have to question Home Depot and Lowe’s approach to this",0,2

In order to change or clean the unit, I have to have someone else do it. Well, not to my surprise, an email Home Depot refused my review and sent me another email giving me a case number and asking me to call them immediately so we can discuss this. Don’t know what needed to be discussed. I said what I thought. HD didn’t like it. Attempting to call Home Depot is the biggest joke in the world! My first phone call I was on hold for 52 minutes listening to this recording of about how great Home Depot is. After 52 minutes I got frustrated and hung up. Second time I called back I didn’t go for the obvious since I never got a hold of a person, I tried to place an order, Trying to place an order on the phone I was put on ‘hold please’ and waited 38 minutes before I got someone with a heavy accent. I had to keep repeating myself as to why I was calling, only to be told that I was calling the wrong department and was hung up on. Third and final try again I just started pushing buttons until I got a different recording, another 45 minutes on hold, to get another heavily accented person asking me for my personal information. she wanted to know my full name,where I lived, what credit card I purchased items with. All which had nothing to do with the reason I was calling and I let her know it had nothing to do with a reason I was calling. Frustrated, I asked her if she was at an offshore call center? repeatedly this heavily accented person said “ I am in a call center for Home Depot.” It took me a good four or five times asking this person if she was at an offshore call center before she finally admitted it. Well if their call center is a ashamed to say where they’re at, if it takes three phone calls and a total of almost 2 1/2 hours to actually get to talk to someone, I hung up. I will not give my personal information to some off shore call center, heavily accented person.

I can’t move into my home until I have a fence built for my dogs. When placing the order it did not give me the ability to select a delivery day due to COVID19 and said that a member would be calling within 24hrs to schedule a delivery day. I didn’t hear anything for 3 days and figured they were having issues due to the current situation. I finally decided to call and the women I spoke with at the N Thornton location said that it was my fault for not selecting a day. I explained what happened and she said that she wouldn’t be able to deliver until April 27, 2020. I understood given the COVID19 situation. She set April 27, 2020 with a 14hr delivery window of 6am-8pm.April 26th came and I checked and it showed the same day and delivery window. I took the day off of work as it stated that an adult had to be there. Again, I can’t move into the house so I woke up and drove to the house so I could be there for the full window in case it came early. I checked online again and again it showed the same day and times. I called the N Thornton location in the morning to confirm and was told that they couldn’t confirm times but that my window was from 6am-8pm. I asked if she could give me a better idea of times and she said no and then hung up on me.I kept checking on the internet and it stayed the same. I waited at the empty house from 6am-7pm. The store was closed at 6pm so I called the 800 number. I was told that the day was changed to May 4, 2020.I didn’t receive a call, email, text, letter, absolutely no form of communication at all.

So then if you use a Visa from a bank that gives you extra benefits for business owners even and they see the word business, NO DISCOUNT FOR YOU! I will just go to Loew's. Tired of it all. They do not want to support Veterans, I think they do it just because Loew's do it with a national database.",0,2
The Home Depot,Placed an online order,"Placed an online order, received it in 3 parts but part 1 was someone else's order. I couldn't find any way to notify them of the mistake through their website, I finally emailed Customer Care with pictures of the packing slip and item shipped, no answer after a few days, so I forwarded the message again. Finally I received a general email back 3 days later to call Customer service. I call and have to jump though a million automated responses to be put on hold for over 45 minutes so far. Needless to say I am taking further business to Lowes. This is ridiculous.",0,1
The Home Depot,We decided to install laminate flooring…,"We decided to install laminate flooring and use Home Depot for material and getting labor. We got excited that we were able to open a credit card with 0% for 12 months. It seemed everything was good until we showed concerned for scheduled time to do the flooring. The weather forecasted to have snow, which is rare in our area. We called to Home Depot to ask if the snow and cold wouldn't be an issue. We were assured that everything was per plan and should be good. The laminate material was delivered on scheduled day and dropped in our garage. We rented a house to be away from the loud noises, dust and open doors, since we had two small children. On scheduled day contractors came and told us they couldn't do flooring since the laminate needed to be inside the house for at least 48 hours to get acclimated. So, they brought the material in and also started removing old carpets to get the area ready to go when they would come back in 2 days. So, we had to book a hotel room for 2 nights. Home Depot promised to cover the hotel room stay. In 2 days contractors started putting the flooring and realised the material was bad, it got moisture and no longer usable. So, we went to Home Depot and they were able to find the same material in their warehouse and delivered it the next day. We had to extend our night in hotel. During that time contractors realized there were no material for stairs included in invoice. Apparently Home Depot sales person forgot to inform us that selected material for stairs wasn't an option for us. So, they didn't include anything, but the carpet has been already removed from the stairs. When the contractors were installing the floor they also realized that the wasn't enough material to do the boarders. So, at that time we had to wait for additional material to be delivered to us, and cap a tread for stairs. So, we had to wait for three weeks for the material to be delivered. Those three weeks we lived partially covered in dust, with boxes and stuff brought down from upstairs rooms. When the material finally made it to us it was not the end to our fun experience with the home Depot. When contractors started to put the cap a tread it appeared to be all defected. Alright, we had to wait other 3 weeks for replacement. When the replacement came only half of the material was good, the rest was defected again. We ended up with half of the stairways completed. Ok, we waited another 2 weeks for new material. Finally it was installed but it was significantly different color that the other half of the stairs. So, now our floor looks like leopard, patches of different colors, floor in the rooms is different from floor on the stairs and stairs are different as well. Well, few weeks later we noticed about 3-4 mm gap between two panels. Apparently it can happen over time. So, not too sure if the journey with the flooring is over yet. So, what we got from home Depot from that horrible experience is apology and 900 buck back. Is it really worth it. I had to spend $400 on house rent, lots of money to eat out or food delivery. ...",0,1
The Home Depot,"Took money, sent order to wrong state and I cannot reach to get my money back","Placed online order on April 6, 2020.Home Depot shipped in two installments. First installment is listed as ""delivered, in mailbox"", however, it has not been received by me nor was it delivered to any neighbors. Second installment was listed as ""in transit"" for 6 days, then went to a status of ""returned to sender"". Upon review of online tracking it became apparenty quickly what happened. Home Depot shipped my order to the wrong state, despite my entering in my detais correctly and PayPal also verifying my address when ordering.I have called 4 times, sat on hold for 8+ hours without getting a person. Attempted texting and was told I would be helped, then they claimed the order did not exist in their system and now Home Depot is not supporting any kind of text support and tells you to call.Emailed three times, no response.

The Home Depot,Extremely bad online customer service,"I ordered two smoke detectors online. I logged in and after putting in my zip code it automatically pulled up that the store we shop at was local within minutes from our house. So I ordered the two smoke detectors and when the order was completed it came back that they would be sending our order to a Home Depot that was over a 2 hour drive away. When I called the Home Depot customer service number provided and waited an hour to speak to an associate, I was told they were unable to do anything about it at this time. But if I called back in 2-3 hours and waited another hour for someone to answer my call, they would probably be able to help me then. What?! We will not be ordering anything from Home Depot online ever. It's taken me hours to work on getting this corrected. I started working on this at 4:30pm and it's now 6:30pm. I'm on my second call to customer service and have been on hold 20 minutes. Dear Home Depot, when you request a customer's zip code and they give it to you, please send their order to the store that's 5 minutes from their home; not 2 hours from their home. This is called basic customer service.",0,1
The Home Depot,My husband visited the store on 4/24/20…,"My husband visited the store on 4/24/20 because we received an email that the order was ready. When my husband arrived at the Pro Desk (chosen for pickup location) they directed him to customer service. He informed the associate he chose pick-up at Pro Desk. My husband waited over 45 minutes before leaving without the door. The next day my husband went back to get the door and the associate said the order was already picked up which was false. My husband waited again for the door. The door they gave my husband was incorrect. We ordered a 28x78 right handed door. They gave my husband 24x78 left handed door. On 4/2620 my husband and I went back to get the right door. At the customer service desk, I asked ""Bernadette"" for the store manager, Daryl Jones, and was told he weren't in. I asked if there was a manager for fulfilling online orders. She said, ""Yes, I'll call Raj."" Then my husband and I were met by ""Jim"", the assistant manager. I asked JIM do you have a manager for online orders and he said, ""No."" I told him I wasn't sure why Bernadette would say that. Jim then asked to see the online order. He said to me, ""Oh this is a special order door."" I let him know it wasn't because it was a simple purchase online. Jim was passive, he said ""Oh this is only a handle mix up."" I explained to him it was more than that, it was about the lack of knowledge and training of over SIX representatives. His tone grew and said, ""Don't get an attitude with me."" I responded, ""You're giving me an attitude now."" He responded in the most unprofessional statement I've ever heard, ""I'm getting an attitude with you because you have an attitude with me."" Isn't a manager's job to help and reassure a customer? Jim instead responded by escalating the situation and not deescalating it. Once we were given the door, at home we noticed damage to the paneling. I called customer service who informed me I could get a carrier or local store driver to pick up the door. THEN I received an email from a ""Jasmine"" informing me that the door could NOT be picked up. That's EIGHT customer service representatives/managers who have no proper training in store processing and general customer service. I will NEVER shop at ANY Home Depot again. I will cancel my credit card and no longer place any installation orders (placed two over $1,000 dollar orders with Home Depot).",0,1

The Home Depot,I am more than understanding concerning…,I am more than understanding concerning the COVID pandemic and the need for HD to limit the number of customers in the store however I am disabled and since there was no one in line I asked if I could please slide through the line barrier instead of walking all the way down and back up because of my paralyzed leg. The HD employee made a huge unnecessary scene and wasnt going to let me through. I dont ask for many accommodations due to my disability ofte but when I do ask I would appreciate a little bit of respect. I am always polite and never demanding so to be treated that way was absolutely inappropriate. I was planning on spending $800+ on yard equipment but I went to Lowes instead where I was treated with respect and dignity. I will not shop HD EVER AGAIN.

The Home Depot,Ordered two Genie garage door openers…,"Ordered two Genie garage door openers online because the price was good and shipping was free. Twelve days later, still had not received the items, even though tracking showed they should have been delivered three days prior. Spent 1.5 hours listening to the canned message on Home Depot support line until speaking to a live person, and then another hour waiting for that person to call FedEx and get back to me. He said that he talked to a FedEx manager and that the items were on the truck and ABSOLUTELY would be delivered by the end of the day. Also, as thanks for our patience, he promised he would give us a 50% credit on the order. Well, the order was not received. Called Home Depot again the next day--this time about 1.5 hours on the phone. We were told that the items were ""lost"" and that we would be credited, but would have to re-order. We decided to re-order because they promised they would give us 50% off (even though the credit card would be charged full price now, with the credit applied later). Another 12 day window for delivery, and I'm guessing we will need to call in again when we don't see the discount applied. Still have not seen the original discount, nor the full refund applied for the lost order. We used two different credit cards so it will be easier to track, but I know there will be more time spent waiting on the phone. I have totally lost faith in Home Depot and will shop at Lowe's as much as possible in the future--who, by the way, gives me a 10% veteran's discount every day, and not just on Veteran's Day like Home Depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,You cant rate them any lower,"You cant rate them any lower. I have bought items from Lowe's their direct competitor what feels like daily during this crisis. Paint included like a review below I have not had any issues getting items correct and on time. However, I have ordered one item from Home Depot due to the deal and the initial ship estimate, why would I doubt it as all the competitors, Wal-Mart, and Amazon have far exceeded any of their shipping estimates during the recent National crisis. However Home Depot must be experiencing a greater affect maybe rivaling our national media as you cannot speak to anyone currently on hold for over an hour, no response to email, and from what I can tell I cannot even see the item arriving by the initial estimate which had a considerable lead time. Its like they are selling items that don't exist as I could not find in stock anywhere else and they had the item on sale. I ordered the item because I kind of needed it and had not done my research on HD, which in hindsight was my mistake.",0,1

They come out and look around then say they don't have the fence I already paid for. I asked the manager how can he sell me something they dont have. He said I will refund your money. I told him I wanted the money back for everything I bought and pointed at my trailer that I already had stuff on. Told him to get his sh** off my trailer. he said I'm not unloading your trailer and started walking off. I told him I wanted to talk to who is over him. He said I will get you a card to corporate. then walked away. I said this is bull sh**. He turn around and told me to get the Fu** off the property and never come back.

The Home Depot,I am so horribly angry also update,"I am so horribly angry. I placed an order online on Monday April 13, 2020. I received no e-mail of confirmation so I called the Customer Service number on Friday April 17, 2020. They did not show my order as received online. Gurrr, the order online site is so poorly set up. While I had customer service on the phone I placed the order because I could not get the order done online BECAUSE THE SITE SUCKS. The gentleman was very helpful and once the order was placed I was told that my order would be delivered to me anywhere from April 18 to April 20, 2020. Guess what.... DIDN'T HAPPEN. I called on Tuesday the 21st and was told that there was no way my order could be delivered to me in that time frame and that customer service had no right to say that. DUHHHH!!! I asked so how long then? Answer: another 5 to 10 days. WOW!!!. Ok so last night April 23, 2020 I received an e-mail finally that my order has been shipped. Today is the 24th of April, I had expected it to arrive and made arrangements to have someone here to take the order in. It is now 6:02 pm and MY ORDER HAS NOT ARRIVED. When I tracked/checked my order online, turns out Home Depot turned my order over to UPS for delivery. The Home Depot site directed me to the UPS delivery site, NOT COMING UNTIL END OF DAY APRIL 27TH. None of this had been explained to me on the phone … twice. Had I known all of this was to happen I would have cancelled the order or arranged to pick the order up at curbside in Whitby which it the nearest Home Depot. THIS HAS BEEN TOTALLY 100% UNACCEPTABLE. HOME DEPOT SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. TENSIONS WITH COVID-19 are high enough already. The only reason I asked for home depot to deliver was because I have MS and no immunities, however, I could have arranged for our designated person from our home to pick up at CURB-SIDE. So the staff that I hired to come in this weekend to complete a job in my home which was dependent upon the order arriving on time has now been CANCELLED!!!!!!!! I am NEVER GOING TO ORDER FROM HOME DEPOT AGAIN!!!!!! LET ALONE PLACE THE ORDER FOR DELIVERY. SO ANGRY!!!!!! I SHOULD JUST REFUSE THE DELIVERY, SEND IT ALL BACK AND ASK FOR A REFUND. UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! ONE CHEEZED OFF CUSTOMER. I HOPE HOME DEPOT CONTACTS ME AND MAKES THIS RIGHT, BUT I GUESS THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH!!!!M.D'AguiarUPDATE TODAY IS MAY 8. The order finally arrived on April 27th. The 3 shelving units were thrown on my front porch. They did not ring the door just tossed them on the porch. We opened them up. ALL THREE WERE SMASHED INSIDE. Got on the phone with Home Depot. 2, 3, 4 and more hours per day on hold from April 27 to May 7. I was disconnected, hung up on, cut off, circuits were too busy, no longer taking refund arrangements over the phone. AND ANY OTHER POSSIBLE EXCUSE THEY COULD COME UP WITH.... Finally was able to speak to someone yesterday. They e-mailed me two emails to make arrangements to return the shelving. The first was Authority to return. The attached forms did not open up. The 2nd email was the return labels. I could not print them from my Samsung S9 even though I have printing capabilities so had to send them to another computer to print. The tracking number was there but I could not make arrangements using the file to make the appointment to have the shelves picked up. It would not work!!! It also said that I would have to pay to ship them back, WHY!!!!!!. I gave up but was able to print the 3 shipping labels. We ended up packing the shelving into our truck, driving up to the local UPS store, off loaded the shelves, took them in and made arrangements to return them from the warehouse. This whole thing has been a freaking nightmare. I just hope that Home Depot credits my credit card once they receive the damaged shelves back. If not I will be one really angry lady again. I will never order anything online from Home Depot again. Btw when I contacted by phone the store at Victoria Road Whitby the attitude from the Customer service deck was at best completely uncooperative and when I asked to speak to a Manager, he sent a message that he could not help me because it was an online purchase, refusing to answer the phone. I was then given a supposed head office number. Right, sure it was the number that I had been calling for a week as listed on the online website which is horribly arranged. Horrible, unorganized, stupid system, terrible customer service. Don't order online from Home Depot... ever... don't let UPS deliver ANYTHING. May 1st picked up 3 shelving units, same manufacturer, same make and model and same sale pricing, no breakage, from Costco. Shelves are up.Home Depot SUCKS. MDA",0,1

First excuse: we’re not sure what happened but it’s shipping tomorrow. Second excuse: it wasn’t shipped because it has rust on it (a brand new mover has rust, really). But I’ll deliver it first thing tomorrow myself. Third excuse: it can’t get shipped until it gets an inspection. We don’t know when that will be but as soon as it happens we will ship. Really guys, get your heads out of you asses and figure this out. Stop lying to us and making excuses for each other. This is the worst customer service we have ever experienced. Never again!!!!",0,1

Why did Home Depot not begin to implement a program to help the Military families, some are currently 100% disabled. This is a catastrophe and needs to be addressed by Upper Management. This comment is for online purchases, which 80% of the country now heavily relies on. I even offered to show my ID after the stay at order is lifted to only be told ""NO"". We can't credit you back after you made your purchase online. SHAME on Home Depot for having this policy with Military Active Duty, Retired, Veterans and Disabled.",0,1

The Home Depot,If I could leave a zero star I would!,"If I could leave a zero star I would. I tried to order online last night (4-21-2020) There website was not informative at all about “Curbside” pickup. There were no instructions at all. My husband and I decided to drive there the next morning and go into the store to pick up some items we needed. When we got there, there was a line from one end of the building to the other. We thought they were “browsers” wanting to go in and shop. We saw signs that said park here for curbside pick up. Where we only needed 4 things, we decided to park and place an order and they would bring it out to us. (Again, no instructions on how to do this.) I guess I should be a mind reader and know how this works. After I placed my order online, at the end of the transaction it said go into the store, and go to the service desk to get your order. That was not what I wanted to do. I called them from the parking lot and they said they had to pick my order, there was about 30 people ahead of me. No time was mentioned. After 1 hour of waiting I called the store. Now here we are, 4-22-2020 at 12:30pm a younger man answered the phone, with an attitude I might add. I asked him nicely, if it was going to be much longer because I had to go to the bathroom, and we have been waiting in the parking lot for an hour, should I go home and then come back? He proceeded to preach to me that I had to wait at least 2 hours for them to “pick” my order. (Nobody told me that before because there were no instructions). I asked him, “Should I come back?” He hung up on me!!!! Can you believe that??? Really??? Is that how you treat your customers? He should be fired!!

The Home Depot,Couldn't even deliver simple $45 soldering iron kit,"I ordered a small/simple $45 soldering kit on April 7th and did not receive it until April 21st even though my estimated delivery date was April 10th. I understand there might be delays during the Covid-19 pandemic but I did not receive an e-mail, text, or phone call informing me of the delays and the tracking info/order status on their website was not functioning. So, they took my money on April 7th before anything had even shipped and never communicated with me so I had no idea if my item was actually going to arrive or not. Unfortunately that's not even the worst part, not only was I charged on April 7th but I was then charged again on April 13th and again on April 17th. The 2nd and 3rd charges were eventually refunded and I didn't lose out on any money but it's extremely unprofessional to take a customers debit card info and make multiple unnecessary charges on multiple different dates. Scary that a large company like this could be so irresponsible. I never even received an apology for their actions let alone a discount or refund or coupon or anything like that. I would like to point out that a few days before this I placed an order with rona.ca for grass seed and clover seed and my items arrived in 2-3 days with tracking, no problems. In the future I will be using Rona, or Lowes.",0,1

It has not been delivered and I can't get though to cancel it. The delivery charge is twice the cost of the actual item and it's been 5 days since I paid for it. Home depot CANNOT DO ONLINE BUSINESS.

They sent an email stating the paintbrush part of my order was ready for pickup but I didn't want to make a trip again to get the paint when it came in. Ten days later, the paint still hasn't shipped but I keep getting emails saying I need to pickup the brushes. Why would I possibly need the brushes without the paint? I could never reach anyone in customer service and was disconnected several times. Going to cancel the charge on my card. Never again will I buy from this worthless online business.",0,1
The Home Depot,I recently hired Home Depot for their…,"I recently hired Home Depot for their services to install shelf’s in my master closet. A lady came out measured, took down all of my request, and scheduled for someone to come out and do a second measurement. That part went smooth. The guy came out measured said ok and had us sign the paper work. We signed it on a tablet that messed up 500 times while signing. We then waited 4 weeks for them to come and install what we requested. After they got here and installed it almost everything was wrong and not what we originally ordered with the First Lady. We ordered the rods in mate nickel they came as chrome same for the knobs on the drawers. The knobs were not only the wrong color but not the style we picked out! I said no to no long hang and I’m sure you can guess it we got one long hanging shelf. One shelf is slanted and some of the wood that was sawed is far from a straight edge, and chipped. I called the lady who came out and took the Oder per say and she confirmed my request and told me to take it up with the second guy who came out and I did so. However he never got back to me. So Needless to say I’m very displeased with their services.",0,1

A family member of mine was fired after an altercation with a man who was trying to shop lift merchandise. An employee saw a man take out items that he did not pay for so he asked another employee to come witness(who happened to my family member). They followed the man outside and asked him to stop and asked for his receipt. He would not produce a receipt and continued to try and put the items in his car. He was told the police were called so he proceeded to push my family member away. My family member pushed back in self defense. (That's all he did) And by the way the Shop Lifter was a big man.

The Home Depot,Horrible is putting it nicely,"I went to order a major appliance (electric range). I applied for the Home Deopt credit card, was approved and wanted to apply it to my purchase. Errors with the online purchase occured. I called and was on hold for over 15 minutes. The first person I spoke to said she wasnt sure what the problem was and disconnected me. They always ask your name and phone number first, yet, they don't call you back when they supposedly disconnect you. . . . I called back and was on hold again for over 15 minutes. While I got someone who was somewhat helpful, she suggested that I buy a gift card as a work around. I told her I just wanted to make the purchase & however I can do that successfully, I will do. So we proceeded and purchased the gift card. She said it would just be a few minutes to get it electronically, well, it was over three hours. So, I lost the delivery date that I wanted as I was waiting for the gift card. When I finally got the gift card, i ran into more problems. I called again, was on hold for over 30 minutes.

I didn't know until I couldn't use the gift card until after what I thought was the final step to make the purchase. Nope, I got an email from DO NOT REPLY and they said ""for some reason, it did not work"". Again, why do they take your phone number if they don't use it. The overall process took over 5 hours. I decided, they don't get my business, but, a review and a follow up with the Better Business Bureau as my credit took a hit as I applied for a credit card, which I couldn't use and also, a gift card that i ONLY purchased for this appliance purchase.

The Home Depot,"Covid-19 no concern at Home Depot Saugus, MA","Home Depot, Saugus, MA. 03/29/2020.We are currently experiencing the covid-19 pandemic, and everyone is expected to practice social distancing and keep at least 6 feet apart. Keeping with these guidelines, I placed and paid for my HD order online. However, when I went to pick it up, the door next to the customer service entry (which is open during normal times) was locked. I needed to use the door on the other side of the building and pass by everyone in the store (coming and going) to get my order. If that wasn't bad enough, at this one entrance that was open, for some reason they put up railings forcing all customers to funnel through this narrow walkway when entering or leaving the store. Very irresponsible on the part of HD Saugus, MA management.",0,2

The Home Depot,Cruddy experience,"Well, this is what we got when we bought our new appliances folks. The underneath portion of our kitchen sink is ruined. First of all we bought a fridge, stove, and a dishwasher as it was a bundle special they were running at their Fuquay location. Home Depots people that were sent to our home removed all 3 appliances. Unbeknownst to us they were not supposed to touch our dishwasher. A plumber was to come take the old one and install the new one. Well, after the fact it was taken they didn't plug the ""Y"" spout and water completely ruined the entire portion under our sink. When I try to call, I am given the run around and we filed a claim and never heard back so our home owners will be billing you guys. Nobody even offered us any compensation for our troubles during an already hard time. Now we are supposed to have a fence installed through them and no pun intended, I am on the fence about it, because I think I want to take our money elsewhere and would like to urge you all to do the same because quite frankly nobody needs this headache.",0,1
The Home Depot,Don't waste your time ordering onlin,Don't waste your time ordering on line. I thought with the virus going on I would order my bags of mulch online pull up and get my order.WRONG you have to walk along ways because of them thinking they are making us safe but when you get done taking a mile trek feels like that when your old. then get in the store with your online reciept(should of saved the paper) you stand in line with a lot of other people and there wasn't enought room to stay away from people. They rering your order give you another slip then they have you walk the mile trek again to stand in line in the hot sun for 30 min or more to finally get your purchase.I could of walked the trek went in to the store purchased my mulch and taken it out in a cart and saved my self alot of time at home ordering and at the store. Seems they could take a class from online grocery shopping and from Big Lots they do better and they just started because the don't want people going into the store.I guess I change where I buy my mulch.,0,1
The Home Depot,Don’t trust Home Depot product reviews,"Posted this review. It was approved by HomeDepot. But it’s not there. Mostly positive product reviews on their site is nothing more but a scam:I WAS THE VERY FIRST BUYER OF THIS MACHINE AT CHICAGO NORTH AVENUE HOME DEPOT. LIKED THE VENTING ...I was the very first buyer of this machine at Chicago North Avenue Home Depot. Liked the venting feature, besides washer and dryer look really nice. Bought them on the spot. Delivered on time. Then the reality kicked: watched thru the window 2 delivery guys unpacking, flipping the machines and attaching pedestals on the slushy street. Washer and dryer with pedestals already attached were too big and heavy for them to handle properly. Anyway, they were installed in the cabinet on the 2nd floor. But the excitement short lived - the washer started to shake badly in the beginning of the spin circle. This is when we took a closer look at the machines... They were not even close to being level. Supporting legs were extended all the way out and nuts not even tightened. A big dent on the top. Shipping bolts removed, but taken away. Shipping brackets still in the back (manual says must be removed). Shipping bolt covers not installed (open holes in the back) and missing along with other parts suppose to be ""included"": Drain Hose Guide, Lock Bar. Washing machine legs still attached, thou it's on top of the pedestal, but dryer's legs removed (and missing). After taking out pedestal drawers myself I was able to get under the machines and level them starting from the back. Dryer works nicely, but the washer still shakes badly (slightly less than just after the installation) in the beginning of spinning circle. Love the features of these machines. Confused and disappointed about the excessive vibration. Considering everything mentioned above - not even 100% sure that the washer was unpacked correctly, not damaged inside when brought in with the shipping screws removed, or securely attached to the top of the pedestal. Or may be those remaining 4 legs cause the vibration? Beats me. Not sure where to start... I would gladly return the machines if it was possible. Over $2800 (all included) purchase must be more enjoyable.",0,1
The Home Depot,Warning- Get Your Appliances Elsewhere,"Next time you need new appliances, think again before ordering from Home Depot. I had a delivery of a refrigerator and microwave range scheduled for today between 7am-11am. In addition to drop off, an extra fee was paid for install of the water line for the fridge. (The range was solely a drop off). I set aside my morning, ensuring I planned my meetings around their convenience. I pulled everything out of my broken fridge (which you can imagine is a large amount of food given the quarantine). Everything was cleaned and ready to go. When they arrived they said they needed to call their boss, and left the house, but didn’t say why, and soon after I had customer service call me and say that GE does not allow the installers to touch copper lines which is what I have on my fridge. (Keep in mind, this was never something outlined in the parameters or instructions they give you to prepare for your delivery). She said that they can deliver the new fridge but can’t take the old one. I asked her if we got it disconnected, if they could take the old one as well and she said that they would and to just let the delivery person know. My boyfriend was able to turn the water line off and get the copper line disconnected from the fridge. When the delivery person came back into my home, we informed him of this and he immediately said “I’m taking fridge back to the warehouse” I asked what that meant and he ignored me and started walking away. I said excuse me excuse me as I also followed him and he refused to respond or even acknowledge that I was trying to get his attention. He exited my house and starting rushing back to his truck. I continued to follow him still trying to get his attention and he continued to ignore me as he jumped into the driver seat of the truck and told his partner to get in the passenger side. I continued to say excuse me and he said one moment. And I said no, I want my fridge and range- you’re obligated to deliver it. I told them that they’re both in their seats with the truck turned on and they appear to have no intention of delivering the appliances that are owed to me. (Mind you, the range was delivery only from the start so there’s no reason that shouldn’t have been delivered) With that, they sped off with no explanation and with my appliances still in tow. I then had to reconnect my old (and leaking fridge) and reload everything back inside that I had just unloaded 30 min prior. Home Depot’s resolution? Rescheduling another appointment for next week that I will now have to block time for, and go through the entire process of unloading a very full fridge and freezer again. The level of disrespect and lack of customer service is unacceptable. I cannot believe that a big name like Home Depot works with contractors that treat their customers this way. I am also extremely disappointed in Home Depot’s nonchalant response of “just rescheduling the appointment for next week.” They did nothing to turn this around into a positive experience which is very telling.",0,1

The Home Depot,I was drafted in aug 1966,"I was drafted in aug 1966. I did not dodge the draft. I served my country. I have used Home Depot for many years because they gave me my 10 % military in Texas as well as here in Destin Fla. Up until 1 year ago, they stopped giving me my discount here in Destin. Now they say that i only get my discount on certain holidays a year. About 3 or 4 times a year since i'm nor retired military, disabled, or active duty. I spent many thousands of dollars last year with Home Depot. I got a letter from Brandon C Hayes, Director, Marketing Credit Services asking me to do more and use their Home Depot credit card. I quit using this card a few months ago because they charged me interest on a bill that we already paid before it was due. We called them and they adjusted my account. Point is I served my country and i guess that it does not mean a damn to Home Depot, a 85 billion dollar company. Please send this to Brandon, probably wont, do it. but I will not shop there anymore unless absolutely necessary. Adios",0,1
The Home Depot,Absolutely horrible service!,"I ordered two nice upgraded one piece toilets to be installed in a custom house. Delivery shows up with one of the two toilets completely broken. As I'm there watching as the courier driver begins to unload them I mention that the one box sounds broken, which clearly it was mangled! The second toilet was fine. I then get the response ""I normally check to see if the items are broken before we load them but today I didn't"". As you can imagine I refuse delivery of both items. Three days later I call the number on the website, and I'm shuffled around by people who can't give me any answers. I'm simply looking to find out when I can expect delivery of the new, undamaged ones. At which point I'm told by the woman on the phone, if I want two new ones I need to place another online order! As for the original order, they can't refund it until they get confirmation from the courier company that the items are damaged.Long story short, for a company as large as Home Depot, they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for handling things this way. This is completely unacceptable on so many levels. The corporate policies are a joke. The people at the call center are underwhelming at best. The courier that I had that day....well, I'm sure you can imagine what I really want to say!Honestly probably the worst online transaction I've ever had to endure. For the record I still don't have the products or the refund!",0,1

The Home Depot,Appliance Nightmare,"I love my local Home Depot for every day items and for DIY projects. In October/November of 2019, we decided to remodel our kitchen. For our first major project, we went to Home Depot to get cabinets. After weeks of trying to get measured for cabinets, back and forth phones call, and emails...we gave up and went to Lowe's for the service we needed. We then ordered all new appliances for the kitchen from Home Depot on November 12, 2019 with Black Friday discounts. As of today, 3/10/2020, we only have the refrigerator. FOUR months, multiple emails, and numerous phone calls later, I feel the customer service just brushed us under the rug. Delay after delay has caused items to become discontinued. It sucks getting a phone call the day before delivery saying an item is on backorder. The first time was understandable. Not the second phone call...the day before we were expecting a redelivery almost two months later.On top of that, having to fight to get them to honor their Black Friday discounts on the items, or even match the price we originally paid. They even added delivery fees for the items. I feel with computers and 1-800 numbers, you just become a number at Home Depot; and employees just want to get you off the line as fast as possible. No one wants to take the time and help you as a person at Home Depot. You have to fight to get what is right, otherwise no one will care. Obviously, this situation is frustrating.

NOT THAT THEY CAME AT THE WRONG TIME AND THAT I CALLED TO SAY THEY NEED TO COME BACK. The people that deal with the installers have already left for the day so they will leave them a note to call me tomorrow.I will give them until 10am to call me.I would NOT Use Home Depot For Any Flooring Work At All.",0,1

The Home Depot,I wish I could give 0 stars,"I wish I could give 0 stars. I ordered a gas range that was delivered damaged on February 25th. I did not receive the delivery, however, the delivery man had already disconnected my original range. He called the office and got a replacement that was to be delivered a week later, so I told him to take the old range away. One week without a stove is not the end of the world. Or so I thought. My replacement was scheduled for March 3rd. I got a call March 2nd informing me that my stove would not be delivered until March 11th due to some issue I don’t remember. Over two weeks without a stove is unacceptable. When I called customer service, all they offered me was an I’m sorry. I will never purchase another appliance from them ever again.",0,1
The Home Depot,I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews from…,"I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews from bigots on this site. Everyone is complaining about botched installs of appliances and issues with vendors. How is any of that Home Depot's fault guys? They have no control over the companies the customer schedules installs with. All Home Depot can do is sell you a product and provide support for that product. The installation of said product is completely out of Home Depot's hands because they contract with third parties for all of their installs. I read a review from a lady that bought a hot water tank and scheduled an install with a third party, a company not affiliated with home depot in any way. The guy had to move her washing machine to make room for the new tank. When the lady washed a load of laundry, the washer drained it's load in to her basement because the installer didn't put the drain hose into the drain after he moved the machine. I agree that's an unfortunate event and a mistake on the installers side. BUT NONE OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOME DEPOT! You people need to put blame where blame is due! She bought the tank from home depot and the tank performs as it should. That is the extent of Home Depot's responsibility. They have no control over third parties. You people need to stop blaming Home Depot for things out of their control. I am a contractor and I've been doing business with Home Depot for 20 years and have never had a problem. I purchase things from them and I install the things I purchase. No issues",0,5
The Home Depot,Abysmal hot water heater installation...the WORST customer service ever!,"In December my hot water heater began leaking. I visited the local (Port Orange) plumbing department and got information about their installation contractors, Delta Mechanical. Within a couple of days, my call was returned from Delta and after giving the customer service rep the dimensions and model of my water heater, made arrangements for a new one to be delivered and installed in my home. A couple of days later (December 10) the technician arrived to install the new hot water heater. Unfortunately, the sales rep had sent a 40 gallon heater to replace the 30 gallon heater which was in place, We determined that the 40 gallon would fit if the washer was moved, which the technician then proceeded to do and installed the new hot water heater (about an hour and a half). He then said we were all set, and left for another job. However, there was no hot water because he had failed to turn the circuit breaker back on. When we figured that out and got the heater working, I got to take a hot shower for the first time in days. After my shower, I decided to take advantage of the hot water and do a load of laundry. When I later went into the laundry room to check on the load, the room was flooded which then proceeded to flood my house, so I had to spend over 3 hours trying to get the water out of my house during a storm outside (and ending up after midnight). When the tech had moved the washer, he had knocked the drain hose off the pipe in the back of the washer which then caused the flood. I called Delta the following day and told them about all the problems (so far, the wrong heater delivered, the circuit breaker, and the worst part of course the flooding). They gave me tons of excuses about how none of that should have happened but offered a solution of $100 off the VERY EXPENSIVE installation for my ""inconvenience"" while claiming that I could not prove that their employees/contractor caused the problems. They also told me that part of the reason the installation was so expensive (over $800 for about an hour and a half) was because the building permit was so expensive. I hung up and called my city offices and learned that a building permit had not been pulled. The installation was on December 10th. After too many to count conversations with employees at Delta and even a visit to the Home Depot where I had placed my original order, nothing changed. I finally decided to settle with Delta after almost 2 months of hassling with them and getting nowhere except making me upset and agitated every single time I had to repeat this story. It is now February 27 and although I have been promised 3 times this would be resolved, this company STILL has not pulled the building permit for this installation, although they have lied to me and promised at least 3 times that it would be taken care of AND I was charged for a building permit. I am now noticing all the bad reviews about Home Depot at this site and no wonder. This has been the WORST customer service experience in my life (and I am 66 years old so have some experience). How is it possible that this company stays in business. Back to Lowes for me for any building/construction/installation needs I have from here on. BE WARNED>",0,1

The Home Depot,terrible tool rental experience,"Review- I ve had a terrible tool rental experience at HomeDepot, I drove a 5 times to the store with a one hour trip because all 5 floor nailers I rented didnt work. The 3 day work weekend I set aside with my work mate have been tiring and super unproductive driving each time to replace the one before. The Home Depot staff have been sort of helpful but relatively incompetent. Chris tool rental manager , Store manager Maher put little to no effort to sort out the issue. Maher in particular didn’t seem to care less. I’ve had to argue my point of lost time and travel the 3rd time I was in. What customer service! They granted me a free rental for a few days playing it off as if they were being generous with the offering, and gave me another “generous” curtesy— a whole 10% ,$1.50, off a box of staples because I had to swap the nailer for the stapler gun— all the ones I rented and returned didn’t work !!!! Wow thanks guys! Anyone renting tools in Boulder I suggest going to Resource on Arapahoe or sun belt rentals.com, who’s service seems much more considerate & intelligently staffed. Home depot and staff in the tool rental department definitely doesnt full fill the false publicity that you ll hear on the phone while waiting, “ providing tools for the doer to get things done “ (impossible when they dont work) “budget rentals for the DIYer” (I would have paid $240 for 7 days use of a nail gun if they hadnt cleared my charges because none of them worked well- def not budget rentals) “helpful & knowledgeable tool rental staff ready to help you out” (the staff 1 out of 5 are knuckle heads and hardly lift a finger to accommodate you if their at fault , basically they appear trained to ring u up and send u out the door.”",0,1
The Home Depot,READ THIS REVIEW!,"Most people right reviews because they're pi**ed, and I get it BUT.... Rating Home Depot at a 1.6 is SO OFF from what a fair review of the store should be. At least from my local Home Depot it would be. My Home Depot would be rated at the highest end of the scale. I live near the Richland, Pa. store and I came on here just say how helpful my local store is. From the time you walk through those doors someone is approaching you to see if you need assistance. Today, it was a young lady named Tamira. Friendly, smiling and just happy to help. I asked for the sections I needed to replace my kitchen sink hardware and cocking. She pointed me in the right direction and actually called on a radio for a gentleman named Shawn to assist. This kid was so helpful, knowledgeable and all around pleasant as well. And you think to yourself ""not everyone can be like this"" but I tell you they are! They MUST be trained a different way at my location because it's true. I then forgot I needed cleaning products for mildew removal and headed over that way. A young man named Corey was stocking shelves and it happened again, ""man do you need help?"" That's when I knew I was writing a review, that this store must be trained a certain way. These people and whoever trains them need to be a model for ALL their other stores. This isn't 1 or even 2 people with a high work ethic and pleasant disposition, it's EVERY TIME I GO THERE! I wish I could do something else besides name drop 3 people and give them a 5 star rating because it's not easy to always be pleasant and helpful but that's all I've ever encountered. So when I came to this site and seen these ratings I was shocked and kind of pi**ed because these ratings aren't indicative of MY local Home Depot. Thanks for reading",0,5
The Home Depot,THIS IS A HELPFUL REVIEW,"THIS IS A HELPFUL REVIEWI've two homes and two businesses and have spent many thousands over the years at the Home Depot, so...What should you use the Home Depot for? If you need a small bag of screws, or some 2x4s, or PVC pipe, if you need a quick hand tool or shop vac, a lighting fixture or yard tool - this is the place. Their prices and selection are the same or better than Lowes, ACE, the corner hardware store, etc. Staff are uniformly friendly and about half the time they have an expert who can walk you through a problem. This is why you see a lot of small business professionals there as well as advanced amateurs shopping there. When you need a wide selection of something simple, and at a good price, and you need it now, the Home Depot should be your first stop. This is what they do best. What should you not use the Home Depot for? Basically if it's something you can't walk out of the store with on the spot, you're taking a risk. Whether it's a custom door project, flooring, a major appliance, kitchen cabinet install, bathroom renovation, etc...there's a good chance there's going to be a problem and most importantly they can't fix it. When something goes wrong you'll be left dealing with well-intentioned, but powerless customer service reps or with the vendors they outsource their services to and these vendors will just point back at HD and vice versa. The company is just too big and complex and they just haven't figured it out or it's not a priority. So if you've got something more valuable or complicated (again something you can't walk out of the store with on the spot and that includes the equivalent if you order online) then there's a good chance you're in for a rough ride. For those items or projects you're better off going to a smaller retail outlet or contracting with a local small business directly. If you'll scroll through their reviews here and elsewhere you'll see the same thing everywhere. It may cost a bit more, but I know from experience you'll be happier.",0,3

The Home Depot,Won't use hand scanners.,"Home Depot usually carries what I need if it's not too specialized a product and I shop there often. My concern is about the newly installed handheld scanners at the self checkout lanes. I refuse to use them because every day tens, if not hundreds, of people pick up those scanners. This is a perfect way to spread diseases. If you respond by saying there are enough pesticides incorporated into the rubber-like grips that they will kill all the pathogens, then this is a perfect way to give a little dose of pesticides to all those that pick the things up. It now takes me longer to check out of Home Depot. I liked self checkout before, now I avoid it.",0,3

The Home Depot,We  ordered the product on line and…,"We ordered the product on line and waited a month for it to be built and shipped to our shop. The product was a woorlpool tub with shower surround. Th on line add clearly stated it was built with tile flange. We got a call just after the order was done from Jose Paz from SWCORP the manufacture in Florida. We ordered a right hand drain and was told that model only come in left hand drain. At this point we had not cut our slab for the remodel. I agreed to take the left hand model. about 3 weeks go by and our product is delivered to our shop. I open the box to find the tub that was sent is not designed for a shower surround and there is no built in flange to except the shower surround sent with the tab. I call the manufacture and got a copy the product catalog only to find that that model tub 6 version none have a built in flange. The manufactured offered to send me an add on flange. this was not a viable resolution. The added flange would allow for a future water intrusion and would not be a unwarrantable product for me to install. I called for a return of the product only to find it would be 5-6 days before the transport company would call me and then it would 3-5 days before a refund is completed. I requested added service we are a small company and our time line and budget is limited. I called on the 02/18/2020 around 10:00am central time and spoke to HD service rep and requested a return follow up call we a greed on a 8:00am call central time for follow. 8:45 am central time after getting no return call i follow up again with HD service. I spoke with Anthony to find out there was no call placed to the shipper, there was no follow up call scheduled for 8:00am. I am on the job site with answer for my customer. Anthony called shipping direct and provided a shipping order number and contact phone number I have been told there will be a call some tin the am on the 20th. In the mean time I am now trying to find a product for our customer and expedite shipping and install. I asked what HD will do for to better this with my customer and was told HD will refund my money ( at least a 1-2 week delay) and they do not compensate customer for return issues. THe has put my job on hold now for at least 2 weeks. I customer is upset and left with an out standing dept waiting on a refund and now looking for a replacement product. Stay away from Home Depot there they have dropped all there contractors service and discount. There stores do not provide customer service and there on line service is a scam.

The Home Depot,WARNING:AVOID HOME DEPOT!,"The Belt drive on my garage door opener shredded, wanting to replace it immediately I went to the Cattlemen Rd Home Depot, selected a Genie garage door opener & went to the pro desk to schedule an appointment. They explained I have to call the Genie number to schedule which I did, they stated they do not schedule installs on the weekend only repairs. I still do not understand why it could not be scheduled. I called again Monday, leaving a message, I called again Tuesday, leaving a message, Wednesday Genie finally returned my call offering me an appointment on 2/14 with a 12 - 3 window that would work even though I made reservations for Dinner on Valentines Day. 12 noon came & went as did 1pm, 2 pm, & 3 pm. My Dinner engagement was an hour drive away, at 3;20 I received a call from Genie that the installer was running late & on his way. I agreed to wait if I could change my Dinner reservations, I called the Restaurant, they stated they were very busy, if I didn't show up I would lose it. We dressed for Dinner leaving at 3;35, at 3:50 I received a call from Genie stating the installer was there, no one was home & there is a note on the door. I explained about the restaurant, the girl told me to call Saturday to reschedule. I called, they refused to reschedule me until I called again Monday. I called twice Monday before getting a call at 3:16 that they can reschedule me for Wednesday, 2/26, I explained that I was hung out to dry for 3 1/2 hours, leaving for a dinner engagement after being inconvenienced for the day, if she didn't give me a recent install date I would return the Genie opener. She responded that's what I have, take it or leave it. By that time I reached my boiling point, telling her F- YOU! & I hung up. My being a good customer spending over $100K there in 10 years meant absolutely nothing. SPOILER ALERT: Home Depot subs out all their work to SLEAZY Contractors, usually a friend or acquaintance of the person hiring them. Tuesday I called a local garage door & opener store, they responded with an appointment Saturday from 10 - 2 no charge, no obligation. Always, the area of least resistance is the Local Merchant.The correct way for Genie to respond was to apologize for the inconvenience, scheduling me for an appointment immediately upon the installer being a no show. Home Depot does not have structured companies to service you, most are fly by night, hit & miss companies. Home Depot tries to put your mind at ease by stating you have a double warranty, getting someone from Home Depot to intervene, DON""T COUNT ON IT!",0,1
The Home Depot,Delivery of refrigerator from Home Depot an absolute nightmare.,"Paid for delivery of new Whirlpool refrigerator and paid for haul away of old refriegerator. The whole delivery and subsequent attempts at getting resolution has been an absolute nightmare. Three inexperienced delivery people couldn't figure out how to get old frig out and new one in. So had to call for supervisor. Had to wait over 30 minutes. Skupersivor figured it out; take off doors. (Which I suggested 45 minutes earlier.)Then in haluling away the old frig, they did damage to my kitchen door and wood trim; in addition the refrigerator itself has scratches ( most likely from manufacturer) and the frig is not cooling correctly. Trying to call Home Depot and get resoltuion is another nightmare. I've literally spent hours on the phone; waiting, being transferred again and again. Then, I have to call manufacturer for scratches and I have to file a insurance report for the property damage to my door and trim. I just wanted Home Depot to take a couple hundred off my bill for the damage and so much inconvenience!! They said they can't do that. Have to have adjustor come out to look at damage.

Day four after my order still showed a status of confirmed but not shipped I called to get an update.

I called again. ""This order has absolutely been cancelled. It may just take a day or two more for it to go through. The charge will be reversed, don't worry"" I should have worried. Two days later. Another charge on my credit card. I called again. After being transferred to several different departments, and refusing to get off the phone. ""Sorry your order can't be cancelled it has been processed to ship"" That is where I lost it. I told them I wanted both charges credited immediately and a cancellation notice to go through and that I was contacting the BBB. That of course did not happen.

Maybe this information will help others avoid the aggravation and frustration of being stuck with inferior merchandise and being told by Home Depot customer disservice that it was my problem and there was nothing they could do. I asked them to escalate my call to their escalation team and I waited 25 minutes before realizing I had been hung out to dry. The issue was a set of fitted sheets I bought online that disintegrated in the exact center of the bottom sheet after about 4.5 months of use. I had bought the sheets in April 2019 and noticed the sheets rotting away January 2020 but I live part-time at three different locations and that is why there was only about 4.5 months of actual use before they rotted away. As a marketing professor, one thing you teach is that it costs up to 70% more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing customer. In the classroom, you use examples of how not to conduct business and thanks must go out to Home Depot for providing an egregious example of catastrophic unprincipled customer service policy. Unprincipled business managers fear the transparency of online customer service because they don't want their dirty laundry aired in public. Principled managers welcome such transparency because they empower their customer service reps to satisfy customers so their is no dirty laundry, and because they want customers to see that any issues are resolved immediately. That is what trust is about and trust is critical to online merchandising. Finally, anybody that shops Home Depot has seen plummeting employee morale in the brick and mortar locations and this points to the fact that typifies how mismanaged enterprises disenchant customers and employees alike. So, after being hung out to dry on the phone for half an hour, the Home Depot corporate voice directory did not recognize Craig Menear CEO. His email address is not easy to locate but can be found but don't waste your time. He doesn't care about you, as if that is a surprise from how you get treated by his minions. He doesn't care based on a lengthy explanation about the rotted sheets and a request for help that included a phone number to reach me. Crickets. Buyer beware.",0,1

The Home Depot,Never again...horrible service,My husband and I had brought a storm door and asked for it to be installed. First we never received a call so we called up there and the gentleman finally found our order and said someone had put it in the system that we weren't ready! My husband told the gentleman that wasn't true because he had paid for them to come out. So we had to wait another 2 weeks for someone to come out. Well to our surprise the guy came out for 10 seconds and I am not joking and took measurements for the door and told me Home Depot will give us a call in 2 business days to schedule another appointment for someone to come out to install the door. So now it's back to the waiting game for our door to be installed. NEVER AGAIN,0,1
The Home Depot,Gross incompetence,"I ordered a Maytag dishwasher from HomeDepot.com on January 22. It was scheduled for January 28, and showed up with what looked like just aesthetic damage on the back of the machine, so I accepted it. But when the installer arrived on January 30, he identified other, structural damage to the machine that hadn’t been visible to my untrained eye, so I had to arrange to have another delivered, which was scheduled for last Friday, February 7. Install of that machine was scheduled for tomorrow, February 12, but I heard from their vendor Premiere that the Home Depot employee had scheduled a delivery, not an install, for tomorrow, and that no installers were available until Friday. At this point, I have had to block out TWENTY HOURS of my time (four hours for each scheduled appointment) for delivery and install appointments for this purchase, in which I have been unable to schedule appointments or projects for my business.",0,1

Then hello can you please hold I'm with a valuable customer at this time please hold. After an hour 20 minutes I'm sorry there's nothing I can do I will cancel the order and you'll have to re-buy the part or you can come get the part. I told the representative that I live in the Rochester ares. For once: why was my ordered sent to N. Buffalo if I live in the Rochester area. I was treated disrespectfully and rude. The N. Buffalo representative needs to take some type of course in answering the phone and not to be disrespectful to customers. My name is Mr. Rivera businessman for RWCCI.,0,2

Just then an employee came over and asked if I needed help. I asked if the full box (30 in a box)policy was meant for these tiles as this box was 25% empty. He said Yes, full boxes only. I said so what happens to this box? I would like to get 10 of them. He said in a really irritated tone ""they are sold in full boxes only, these will either go in the dumpster or set aside to be clearanced someday"" and he walked away with the tiles. So instead of selling me 10 tiles at the full square foot price they were thrown away??? I dont really even care if Home Depot would rather throw the rest of the box away than to sell what they could. My main issue was with the attitude of your employee.

The Home Depot,Recently I was doing a simple propane…,"Recently I was doing a simple propane tank exchange through their kiosk at one of their local Michigan stores. The lady at the check out was quite helpful, but everything after that took a sudden change for the worse.I went to the propane exchange machine and started entering all my information. The machine started sounding like a pinball machine at the top of its game. I looked, and to my surprise one bay opened for my one empty return while TWO other bays with FULL TANKS opened up!Being a retired Sheriff’s Chaplain I knew I was not entitled to a “freebie” so I took the tank I paid for and made sure the other was locked soundly in its holding device before I left.The next morning I called the store and asked to speak to a manager. The first one was busy so I got a lady assistant manager who said her name so fast, an auctioneer couldn’t have understood it.I proceeded to tell her the issue I had with the propane machine the night before. She then asked if I had taken the other tank! Once I told her she had just accused a minister of theft, her tone got dramatically different.I wrote a letter to the president and ceo of The Home Depot and customer services response was because I didn’t get a name, I was basically out of luck. I reasoned with them; how many female assistant managers could have been on duty during this time frame? I got no response.When I responded further with legal action for slander and defamation of character, I got a call from a district manager trying to follow up with me.I returned her calls twice, never to hear from her again.

I will try to make this short but show all the key points.Met with the kitchen design ""expert"" and I use that term loosely. Our 1st appt we sat down, told him what we wanted and he proceeded to use the CAD to design our new kitchen. This took way longer than needed as he wasn't very proficient on the computer! Ugh we should have left then and there but we didn't. Our 2nd appt was to finalize the designs and order the cabinets and counter tops and pay in full. We were there for 3 hours and I swear he used common core math he came up with 3 different prices, but finally gave us a final price. We headed up to the checkout area, wrote a check and was told that check was denied! What! We had plenty of money in our account. We then tried the debit card same thing. We were beyond embarassed and frustrated. We called the bank but it was after hours and never did get thru to their 24 hour CS line. HD tried Telecheck to see if it would go thru that way and it was still denied. We had no idea what was going on. Finally my husband said ""Ok, I can come back tomorrow with a cashiers check will that work do you except cashiers checks?"" All 3 HD employees said ""Oh yeah that's good as cash so yeah no problem"".Next day my husband went to bank (they have no idea why HD denied our check. Said it was something with HD and Telecheck) anyway, gave my husband the cashiers check and he took it into HD and gave it to our designer guy and the cashier. He looked at it and crinkled up his face and said ""Hmmm....hey, Christine, do we take cashiers checks?"" She said ""Nope"" My husband looked at all of them, was ready to tell them where they could put their kitchen designs but thought better of it and said ""GIVE ME MY CHECK"" and stormed out of there. Mind you my husband works nights so he got up early that day to get things taken care of. We wasted so much time dealing with them, but thank God our bank was able to refund our cashiers check and we are having our new kitchen designed by Cabinet World. They were able to give us more information in one hour than the ""expert"" at HD did in 2 appointments totaling 6 hours!

The Home Depot,Home depot...what a joke,"Home depot...what a joke. Their most recent TV add, ""Doers get more Done"".. 1.5 years waiting for flooring to be completed in our 15 year old home... apparantly store number 1863 hasnt listened to their ad. Confirmed and then missed appointments happened at least a dozen times. Home depot blames the installation company and visa versa.. meanwhile we have gone through 2 holiday seasons with flooring incomplete.. it is insane! Specifically store number 1863 in bradenton fl. Managers and associates Rose, Chris, Pat, and Sirina have had a years worth of calls only to be met with unkept promises and excuses.. meanwhile we pay for uncompleted flooring. Whats even more disgusting, I worked for another home depot in the flooring dept!!",0,1
The Home Depot,If there’s a way to give a zero star…,"If there’s a way to give a zero star and still have the review showing up, I’d do it! We bought a standard microwave online from Home Depot and paid for it to be installed, along with hauling away the old one. After a few days, the microwave was delivered but the guys refused to install even though on their work order, it said “installation and haul away”. They dropped off the microwave and said we would get another call fromHome Depot to schedule installation. We waited for a couple of days. No calls. We called back and were only told that the delivery people were supposed to install and haul away as well. A week later, they showed up again. They took our old microwave off the wall and then were gonna drill holes into our back slab. We asked if it’s gonna crack the tiles. They said yes. So while we were still trying to figure out what to do, they started walking toward their truck and drove away. They yelled through the window, “we ain’t do anything today!” We had to make 3 different phone calls back to Home Depot and we eventually gave up and requested refunds for the installation and haul away. It’s been a stressful, distressful, and horribly confusing experience for us. AND, now we are left with a hole in the wall, no microwave, and two (new and old) microwaves sitting there!!!!! We will never buy appliances fromHome Depot again.",0,1

HD has the pipes BUt not a complete range of the fittings.The sales rep I approach simply NOT prepared to help out even when I asked if I could place an order with HD. What's the point if I can buy the PVC pipes BUT w/o the fittings.The rep simply not prepared to run the extra mile to assist.As I walk through HD I can see some of the reps simply ""laughing and chatting"" among themselves.Finally, I went to RENO even when they don't have the pipe fittings on display they took my order and ask that I come back next week and they will have it for me to collect. They run that extra mile to please a customer.I can understand the review for HD is so BAD now and you have just losta very good customer.",0,1

We were told it will be delivered Wednesday so I took off work for Wednesday, Thursday night we get a message that it will be delivered Friday. So I take off work for Friday Thursday night we get a message that it will be delivered between 11 and 3 and then a few minutes later we get a message that it’s being delivered on the 21st now. Now I have to take off again to sit home and wait and hope it actually comes this time. I called the number that they left in case we have any questions or concerns and after getting the runaround was told nothing they can do about it because they don’t carry the appliances and that they come from somewhere else so I said are you telling me that on the 20th there’s a chance I’ll call and tell me that it’s not being delivered on the 21st and I was told yes that can happen. This place is ridiculous, The appliances may not come from them but they should have a way to find out if they’re definitely in stock where they’re coming from and if they’re definitely going to be delivered or not. They shouldn’t be listed on their website with delivery days if that’s not a guarantee. Changing the date once could happen, but again and again is ridiculous.

The Home Depot,Dishonest Paint Sale,"So we went to get primer and a nice white paint yesterday. We walk into the store in Homestead and head to the paint area. There is someone there walking around the paints, it is crowded, he directs us to PPG brand and a basic primer. We buy a 5 gallon of the primer & paint. Claims the PPG is 1 coat paint, it's going on a white wall already. Painter calls today saying they need TWO 5 gallon buckets of the white color as the 5 gallon we purchased before was NOT 1 coat.... so we get to HD and find out the man who sold us the paint was the rep for PPG. Very dishonest sale. Would have been nice if instead of posing as the person in the paint department and telling us he is only partial to one brand in that department we could of had the chance to find someone else. It was very busy and there was only 1 lady there very overwhelmed.... So now because we thought we were good with one 5 gallon bucket and now HAVING to buy TWO 5 gallon buckets, we are out so much money!!! Expensive lesson, but beware of reps selling expensive brands without telling you who they are... Very misleading and very disappointed hearing this from the true sales person in the paint department... We could have saved so much money - bottom line...",0,1

The Home Depot,Promotional deferred interest bamboozle,"I purchased a washer and dryer in October. I came in to by the items due to a promotional letter I received that stated I could have the interest deferred with an amount over $1000. I made it a point to the clerk at the Home Depot in Naples on Airport Road that I wanted the deferred interest. Instead he gave a 10% discount however that is not what I wanted and I had stated that to him. I was worried about getting my washer to my home on a reasonable delivery date and did not pay attention to the final receipt, but I stated at least 3 times that I wanted the deferred interest. The clerk did not comply with the customer's request. the discount he gave was approximately $120. When looking at my December bill I am being charged just under $18 interest. That means in 7 short months the interest payment would exceed the discount. I was adamant that I wanted the deferred interest to the sales associate. He also kept the promotional letter stated he needed the letter for the final paperwork. I just caught the interest charge on this month's bill. I made my monthly payment but called and talked to an Amy on Team 5118. she stated that due to the 10% discount that there was nothing that she could do. I stated to her that I didn't care if the 10% discount amount was put back on my account, that I wanted the deferred interest. She stated that there was nothing she could do ... ""this is no way at this point to do that"". I told her to look at my account history, my charges are always with a deferred interest. I make a point of it in my purchases. I stated to her I have been a long time, over 20 years, a loyal customer that the this needed to be amended. Amy stated that she couldn't help with this at this point. I then stated to that if that is the case Home Depot would not be a store that I would continue to visit, although it is my favorite of all the stores. I stated to Amy that other stores are more local to me, but I make the 20 mile track, across town to the Home Depot, in Florida ""snowbird"" traffic. I am highly disappointed that Amy did not make more of a consideration in the matter. She did not extend the courtesy of asking a manger or trying to make some sort of consideration. I am also disappointed in the store clerks' effort to properly perform the simple duty requested of him, which is sadly his whole point of being a store ""associate"". I get these promotional letters all the time. Now I know they are just a joke, as the clerks do what they want with it, or maybe the clerk doesn't know how to run the register to perform this for the customer. In any event , I've been bamboozled and this feeling is raw, as I truly love Home Depot and visit the Naples store often in my flipping endeavors. I know where everything is and visit 2 to 3 times a week. I have been loyal to the brand, but I can see that it is only a one way relationship. At this point, Home Depot has lost a customer, and I will pay my bill in full and close my credit card accounts. I don't need to feel like a pawn in this situation.",0,1

It is now Jan 2020 and still no back door.

I don't plan on shopping Home Depot any more. The one manager in the Flemington, NJ store told me they would send someone out right away to fix the damaged door because glass kept falling out. He said we don't want that to break. Well no one showed up until they came to install the front door and I asked the installer to look at the door he then said it needed to be replaced it was damaged.

The Home Depot,Carpet Purchase,"Picked carpet out and was told that a person would be out to measure. A home depot rep showed up on 12-4-2019 and measured the room. I was wanting to get carpet installed before Christmas so I asked it that was possible. The rep. immediately got on the phone to call in the measurements. After several times of being rerouted to different people, she finally got in contact with the right person which was also a home depot rep. That person said yes, if the carpet was paid for before 12-6 than it would be installed before Christmas. We were eligable for free installation also. Paid for the carpet and was told that a person from the installation company ""Hom Sollutions"" would be in touch within the next few days to schedule the install. Waited 2 weeks and heard nothing. Finally called Hom Solutions and asked when they were going to schedule the install and that I was told it would be before Christmas. The Hom Solutions person told me that Cheyenne was considered a ""remote area"" and that they could not give me a installation date and there was no guarentees. I told Hom Sollutions that I was guarenteed a install before Christmas if I paid before the 6th. They told me that there was no way it would get installed before Christmas and that Home Depot and them do not communicate about install dates. Wow, was I surprised. Hom Sollutions did not give a $hit about what I was told and would not give me any info of even a estimated install date. Contacted Home Depot about the situation. A manager confirmed what Hom Solutions told me. She also said the Cheyenne is considered a remote area so there are not guarentees for install. Waited until the 1-7-2020, still nothing from Hom Solutions for a install date. Called Home Depot manager again. She called Hom Solutions. Hom Solutions ordered the carpet and the carpet came in but the job was cancelled on 1-6-2020. No calls from Hom Sollutions or Home Depot. Will never order anything of this nature again from Home Depot. There is no such thing as free install. The price of the install in figured into the price of the carpet. Went to the ""Carpet Exchange"" and ordered better quality of carpet, and have a install date within a week or as soon as the carpet comes in. Carpet, pad and install will be cheaper than Home Depot.... Beware of Hom Sollutions, they are out of Colorado and do not care about the Cheyenne area. Shame on Home Depot for using a company like that!!!",0,1

I called LG and reported it within 48 hours. They told me it was an electrical issue so we sent an electrician to look at the outlet and electrical wiring. Our house is a new construction as well. He told us there was no issues with the electrical at all. We called Home Depot again and they sent another technician to look at the installation. The technician looked at it for 10 minutes and said it was a faulty unit and would order us a replacement. We never got the replacement order. We called Home Depot.com again and they said it would take 24 hours for the technician to upload his service. Again, no one called us so we called back. We got transferred to the local Home Depot store. They told us they speak to their manager and call us back. Still no phone call from anyone. I called Home Depot 1-800 number again and they transferred me to a LG representative that said they would have to send their representative to do a service order and review it before sending us a replacement. This has been very very frustrating and we still have no answers or solutions. It was been 10 days. We purchased a brand new dryer that has not worked at all.

The Home Depot,Home Installation Services Post-Installation Service Team Sucks,"This review is about Home Depot”s Home Installation Services. The good: their pre-installation service. Everyone from the person at Home Depot to the contractor who came out to discuss my needs to the installer who measured everything up was quick, helpful and friendly. Why a one-star rating then?Let’s just say if you have any issues with your installation good luck! I hope you have a ton of patience and perseverance. The short version of my story basically was I had a problem with two of the window coverings I ordered which necessitated them to be fixed (one cut to the wrong size, one defective). Getting replacements for them ended up to be a gong show where I had to call many times and ended up waiting almost half a year for things to be remedied. If you are not aware, there are several players involved when using HD’s Home Installation Services: the salesperson at the store, HD’s Home Installation office people, a contracted company that sends their salesperson out to your home, and the installer who installs your product. The problem is nobody wanted to take responsibility on fixing the problem. I obviously started with the Home Installation office as that would make sense. After six weeks of waiting for my replacement window coverings, I decided to call them to get an update. They didn’t know what I was talking about. After explaining my problem, the person said, “I’ll look into this and will call you back.” Nada. After 2-3 weeks I called back and, guess what? The person didn’t know what I was talking about. I repeated myself and the person said, “I’ll look into this and will call you back.” Nada. This entire charade was repeated literally five times over the course of five months!! Each time I called, the person would promise to call back. I never ever received any callbacks. I even asked them if they have my correct contact information, which they did.Getting frustrated with my situation, I started to contact the other players: the store, the contracted company’s salesperson, and even the guy who came out to install my blinds. The store said to call HD Home Installation as he couldn’t do anything. The contracted salesperson never returned my calls. The installer said that he’s just the end-guy and was unable to help. He actually indicated that he was also very frustrated with the people at Home Installation Services both for when he needed things and from hearing complaints from customers, which was common. The conclusion from my perspective was that the Home Installation Services people are either very incompetent, disorganized, unaccountable for their actions, or extremely understaffed. In the end, my installer came to the rescue. He took it upon himself to fix my blinds at his expense (he had his own window covering business) and said he would deal with HD afterwards to get paid for his work. Kudos to him for the only one who I dealt with who knows what good customer service should look like!To this date (seven months later), I have not heard back from HD regarding my complaints about my blinds. Since my blinds have been fixed by the installer, I’m dropping the matter. One thing: I received an automated email from HD saying that they hoped I was happy with my installation and asking for a review. Clicking on the link to submit a review brings up a screen that says I’ve already submitted a review even though I didn’t! Hmm, maybe they really don’t want to receive any bad comments?Steer clear of using Home Depot’s Installation Services. If you do use them, hope that all goes well the first time or you may be in for a bad ride.",0,1

The Home Depot,Worst experience I have ever had with their appliance delivery service,"Worst experience I have ever had with their delivery service. I purchased appliances from the Home Depot in Mid November of 2019. Both items were listed as ""in stock"" at the time of the order. Since I purchased these appliances in the tune of about $2000, I have had my deliver date moved at least 4 times! The first time it happened the night before the scheduled delivery date. AFTER I had taken a day off to receive the appliances. Each consecutive time, it's happened days before it was suppose to be delivered. In early January, when I received my latest delay stating the appliances would be delivered January 25, I called their customer service department to inquire about this. I was told I was put into a cue and I would receive my appliances as my name came up. This was a lie. A few days later, i received emails and voicemails telling me that the appliances would be delivered January 4th (Not the 25th that I received earlier). The scheduled window for delivery that day was 12:30-5:30pm. I waited until 6:30 and left my home because no one showed up. I called again Jan. 6th to find out what was going on. I was told then that an attempt was made to deliver my appliances on Jan.4th. I assured them that no one came. I later discovered thru my ring camera that a deliver man did show up at my front door at 7:30pm - 2 hours after the window. I did NOT receive a call to tell me they would be arriving that late. My deliver was rescheduled with that same Home Depot employee for January 9th. I accepted this new date. On January 7th, I received emails and recorded voicemails that my delivery date had been moved to February 2nd! I called Home Depot customer service AGAIN and was told that they were out of stock and they were not sure when a new shipment would arrive. I asked what was in the truck that showed up at my house on Saturday Jan. 4th if they were out of stock and didn't know when new appliances would arrive. I got the answer, I don't know. So, they didn't know what was being delivered to my house; they don't know when a new shipment of appliances would arrive. I was told by that Home Depot employee that she would escalate my issue and would direct it to a supervisor. She assured me that someone would call me the next day to give me some answers. The day has come and gone and no one has contacted me. I suggest that you NEVER by appliances from this company. I guess I wold have to call their customer service again to hear some new made up story or lie from another employee. I am tired of waiting on the phone only to get more made fake story about my delivery. Approx. $2000 spent and 2 months of waiting with no end in sight. For all I know that latest day of February 2nd is not reliable. In my future, NO MORE APPLIANCES will EVER be purchased from this company EVER AGAIN! I can't trust them anymore. Buy from Lowes, Best Buy or some other company. But the Home Depot has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had after spending thousands of dollars. I wish I could cancel the order and buy from another company. I am in a catch 22 situation because I purchased these appliances in mid November during a sale and I would lose the discounts I got by placing the order. This company is a quagmire of no one knowing how to handle delivering their appliances. Stay away from buying online from the Home Depot and having it delivered. Buy from a competitor because this company is SO BIG, you will get lost in the black hole of this company. To say that I am beyond frustrated at this debacle of a situation is to state it mildly. If you want to buy appliances and have it delivered to your home; The Home Depot is the ABSOLUTE WORST company I have ever had the unfortunate displeasure of dealing with. It's to big.

In 2017 I had to paid the attorney, and doctor court ordered, and i got behind a payment didn't missed it, it was only late once, and I paid off the balance. My credit repair company reached out to them to take it off my credit, and they said no that they are not at fault, and that they couldn't help me, but Khol's did at the first request!!! I just found out that they closed my account for inactivity for a YEAR!!! ONLY and that affected more my credit score 18 points it went down, I personally reached out to them, and she said to me sorry but there's nothing we can do, I asked why didn't you notified me by mail, or a phone call, she said we don't do that is in your paper work when you apply!! That's how much Home depot cares for their customers, I paid off the balance today on the other credit card, and I will try Lowe's to finish my remodeling. I'm soooo disappointed at their policies, so sad 😞",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depots' contracted delivery company really sleazy!!!,"Buying an item that requires delivery is not the problem with HD. The problem is the contracted company that does the delivery for HD. What HD in-store tells you and what the delivery company MAY do are two different things.We purchased a refrigerator for delivery and fortunately, I went over every possible detail with the sales clerk (who was very helpful and who even offered advice to deal with the delivery company) and managed to mitigate potential problems once the refrigerator was delivered. And potential problems did arise but I was prepared, having done my homework.First, they handed me the paperwork to sign off right away. NO, I won't sign until the fridge is inspected for damages, and placed where it is supposed to go (upstairs), plugged in, and working.Secondly, they immediately started complaining that the fridge was going to an upstairs location. This was already cleared in the printed delivery instructions as to the number of flights, etc etc so why they complained, I have no clue. But I held my ground as they stated that they were doing me a favor. I suppose that meant I should give them extra money?? IDK but I did grumble to my son that I was going to get the paperwork and call HD. Maybe they heard me. In any event, they proceeded on with the job they were tasked to do, get the fridge delivered upstairs and plugged in, which they did.I was going to tip them, but decided against it. I figure maybe all the complaining was to elicit extra $$ so nixed that. There was no old fridge to move or to remove.HD customers should not have to deal with such nasty delivery men. These delivery men told me they don't work for HD but for the delivery company to which I replied ""Yes, you work for the delivery company that is ""contracted by HD to make deliveries!"" It seemed they were trying to intimidate me, almost threatening the possibility that they might not make the delivery.",0,2
The Home Depot,Purchased a Black Stainless Stove and…,"Purchased a Black Stainless Stove and Microwave in January 2020, The Samsungstove was on sale $599.00 stainless steel, i wanted the Black resistant stainless steel stove which warranted a $100.00 upgrade which would have totaled $698.40. and my conventional oven was $249.00 and again Black stainless steel $50.00 total $299.00. I supposedly got a 10% discount total came out to 10.24.00. I was ok with it. I got home and looked at my receipt they up the price to the stove to $776.00 that is a $77.00 difference and gave me the 10% discount so they said of that forfeiting my 12 month financing because you cannot combine two discounts or offers. I called in spoke to 2 girls and they did not research on my they up my stove to $776.00 and said it was the sale price. No it was not the sale price the sale price was $698.40. I escalated to a Manager name Linda which took me 47 minutes on the phone to speak to and came on the phone very unproffesional and saying how she has been at the store for over 12 hrs and not has to deal with her customer. I got no resolution from this and did not hear what i was concerned about instead said if you call tomorrow i will talk to you, i said i wanted resolution today i spent 2 hrs of my evening on the phone and she continued to say come in tomorrow and we will talk. This is very poor customer service especially from a customer point of view, i had no respect and no consideration from a Manager that represents Home Depot. I will take this up higher and may also consult a lawyer if necessary. No Customer should ever have to deal with such rudeness and insault. It was a simple case of why a stove that cost $698.40 was jumped to $776 and then add a coupon to it and forfeitting my 12 month financing. I have been a very long customer of theirs and will never recommend Home Depot on Seventh and Whitehall. I hope someone looks at this review and give me back an answer.",0,1

And in NA days they will mail me a Cheque.I paid to Plumber 157.50$ to replace defective part that Rheem sent me .And it's still not working. It means we'll be without a hot water even longer.Called to Technical support again.Send them email with lots of pictures what's going on inside a burning camera.Everything was covered with a black dust (soot).

On top of that when I and Plumber was trying to pilot a water heater the flame was under the burning plate.And when I told to technical support to change defective water heater, thay refused and sending me another, some kind of safety part to replace in brand new water heater!!!

The Home Depot,Well....NEVER AGAIN,"Well..... my husband and I bought a house in August. It needed major updates so we went to Hone Depot to order tile, carpet, cabinets. 3 major purchases!Let’s start with the flooring, picked what we wanted, had them come measure. 1st strike, they didn’t have the rooms right and which room was supposed to get what carpet! After going in and talking about our order, the sales person asked a question out loud..... I answered it. His reply, “we aren’t worried about that right now”. I asked... “then why did you ask?” Got the flooring figured out, waited for install. Went to order cabinets and countertop. Great arrangement, very creative. That is where that stopped. The cabinets were not all ordered together and therefore that got here at all different times. Waited on flooring to get to the cabinets and island for installation. Pick up tile floor and have it installed by our contractor. We have 12 extra boxes of tile that we paid for. Contractor asks, are you sure this transition strip goes from tile to carpet. Husband calls Home Depot, they look it up, yes it is right. Carpet guys come next day, this is a transition strip from tile to wood floor. Have to have it fixed that night in order for carpet to be installed before Christmas. Carpet installers come. CFI were great. Except they tried to take 3 rolls of my carpet that had my name on it. They said Home Depot sends extra. Well I don’t trust that especially since they told the measured wrong. So the carpet stays with me.We all flooring is down, we go to install the cabinets and we’ll, the filler isn’t where it is supposed to be. At this point, I will make it work. Filler isn’t in yet anyway... because that and the pantry were not ordered with everything else and were not realized until I went in and said It is not on the receipt. Cabinets are in island is set. Cone to measure for counter top. The associate did not put the decorative end pieces in the plan for the measure to be accurate. So, I spent over 200.00 for something That is sitting in a closet to be returned because the associate did it wrong. Countertop installation by KBR.... excellent! As of today, we are finishing up the cabinets and there was not toe strip ordered with the other moldings... only a quarter round for an area that is 5 inches in width. I am beyond frustrated, actually went to the emergency room for them to tell me I was not having a heart attack just stress. Maybe I should give them that bill. It makes me said that this experience for my husband and I was a terrible one because of the stress from Home Depot. Never again will I order anything from there. If I can’t take it home, I am not getting it. Essentially every single thing we ordered was wrong. Come next week when my house is completely done. I have a lot to return to Home Depot because of their associates inability to put the correct information into the computer..... even after telling you what they are ordering!",0,1

In stead of simply getting out of the van to go inside and say they had a delivery, be sent to the frieght elevator, they had a ""service"" call my cell, not my office phone and leave a message saying guy was going to be outside for 15 minutes and then leave unless i came down to get the fridge from the truck. Had I known that I was supposed meet them or given a 30 minute heads up taht they were coming and needed me to be downstairs, ok. But call came in during time I was in a meeting, was from an unknown number so I did not pick up, and yep, they left saying that i had to reschedule. Needless to say, I cancelled the order.

The refrigerator it self is fine . The communication between Home Depot and their delivery is HORRIBLE. I received a call a half hr. after the refrigerator was to be @ my house telling me it will not be delivered until Jan 3 2020. as the staff called in and there were no drivers available. . what a shiiii show Home Depot is.

The Home Depot,Unorganized and unprofessional,"Delivery process was very unorganized and delivery reps were rude and unprofessional. The home depot and the delivery company should be more organized. Home depot and the delivery company should be on the same page. The day after my in-store purchase a representative called requesting that an adult be home between 1pm and 5pm for delivery and that they would call before they come. There was no phone call and delivery came early. According to Home Depot the delivery company should install and make sure the machine works properly, they did not do that. The delivery man said that Home Depot would call us to organize appointment for installation. No one called. We called the Home depot where purchase was made every day for 2 weeks; each time we were put on hold and call was disconnected every time. Finally, we called an 800 number where a representative (Jennifer) was able to help. She had the delivery company call us. We set up an appoint for delivery, they said we would get a call before delivery, but again no phone call prior to delivery. During purchase we signed a contract and paid for the delivery company to discard the wrapping and the old machine, but the delivery man said the company will send someone else for that. When that person came he was very rude and unprofessional. He took the machine, but not the wrapping. When I asked about the wrapping he said, he'll do me the favor of taking it, but he isn't supposed to take it. I will not refer the Home Depot to anyone and will definitely not make any other purchase of this caliber at the Home Depot",0,1
The Home Depot,This was a company I went to for…,"This was a company I went to for everything. As a new home buyer first remodel I chose kitchen. The salesperson was from a contract company outside of home depot and a large portion of the interaction was non factual. This person told me, ""Don't even unpack your kitchen, tomorrow I will have my people come do measurements and the following week we can start putting the cabinets up."" The next day people got measurements, and I did not hear from anyone until I reached out two weeks later where I found out there is a ten week minimum of start date. I was also informed if I put money down the credit card would not need to be paid off until after the renovations. My response after hearing all of this is I need out of the contract, I have been lied to I would have shopped around if I had known this was going to take just as long as any other company. I was threatened with my contract to pay thousands of dollars to get out of it. They had not even started cutting wood yet and I have to pay three thousand dollars. On top of the credit card bill comes in the mail, and where I was promised it come later it came sooner and the pay off date was 6 months instead of two years. I have since spoken to management about all the discretions, have been informed the salesperson would be reprimanded and the 6 months interest free would be corrected. Neither events have been taken care of. At this point sales person lied, management has not followed through, I will talk about the project supervisor who kept me in this contract forged with ill intent. She was the first person I told of the salesperson first and had not escalated it to management in the beginning. They were not aware of the situation when I finally got in contact with them. She stated I would have weekly updates which did not happen and when customer service got involved they both called me a liar and I was supposed to reach out. I insisted on getting the phone conversations where I am in fact being truthful. At this point, two months later management finally gets involved and states nothing we can do for you, and if you want out your contract at this point you have to pay for about half of the entire project. Now it is time for project to be started I am assured everything is in order. Half the supplies are missing. it took him an extra day that was promised to complete half the work. I have two cabinets missing. No back splash done. the soap dispenser feature and pull out trash not done, and no one has reached out to me. Two weeks later half a kitchen with no communication like it has been the entire time. The exterior looks great with the exception of missing cabinets, but saw dust is everywhere I have had to wash everything down myself and rewash all my kitchen ware. The soft close feature that is suppose to add value is such a hassle to even open the drawers I don't even know how much extra I had to pay for that. I have never regretted a decision so much in my life, and I hope I can prevent someone else for having this poor experience. If that salesperson did not lie in the first place I would have not rushed and could have done more research and I am seeing the reviews are horrible across the board.",0,1

The Home Depot,Washer/Dryer Delivery Fail x2,"We ordered a washer, dryer and pedestals from HD on November 17. Delivery was not available until December 6 which we knew and agreed. When they arrived for delivery/install they showed up at 630 pm the exact end of their time frame window and being as it was Friday, I’m sure had been a long day of deliveries. However they came in and quickly told us they couldn’t disconnect or install to which my husband offered to do himself. They left to their truck to ‘make a phone call’ and while my husband was finishing unhooking the machines perhaps 5 minutes tops we look outside to see that they LEFT. Just left. Didn’t leave our appliances, didn’t say we’re leaving for x reason, no explanations, nothing. We then call the HD we ordered through to be told they would look into and get back the next day. The reason was that something was too old and needed replacing and they weren’t going to do this. That’s all well and good but they took our items we paid for didn’t even deliver or haul the old ones which they could have done minimally. We called our plumber who came that Monday and reviewed everything and we asked him to install all new valves hoses etc just to ensure next delivery would be no issue. $350 later and we’re set everything should be great at the rescheduled delivery. Flash forward to today January 3 when it was going to be delivered and the team comes in and starts off with the same nonsense the other crew said. Now we know for a fact everything is in working order it is all brand new - but they refuse to install and say that they can’t even deliver!! This did not go over well with me I am very level headed but when I heard them saying this I could feel my face turn red. They go to their truck and I get a phone call from somewhere in Tennessee saying something about not installing when I handed the phone to my husband. We convinced them to deliver the new machines in the garage but now we are stuck with our old machines still upstairs and now the new outside and no answers of who will be installing/hauling, which we paid for almost two months ago. We will NEVER purchase anything from Home Depot again. It is sad as we love the employees at the local store and our kids love the projects there every month which is a fun family event we look forward to building and then shopping for items we need around the house.

The Home Depot,Deliver w/ no Installation or parts,"Deliver w/ no Installation or partsI made an entire order of new appliances worth over $5,000.The delivery came on time but the work order had no installation for none of the appliances nor did they delivery any of the parts for installation that I paid for. The phone number to call never leads you to a real person. You have to select that you will be making a new order for you to speak someone. So it took me after 6x times of calling them to figure that out during the delivery to figure out what to do. Then that person had to talk to someone else. I figured out HOMEDEPOT.COM has a glitch when ordering you can select installation with the parts and the only thing that will transfer over to the work order is the parts and not the installation. ONLY THEN were they able to reschedule an installation because they were trying to tell me I didn't select installation. SURE PLACE THE BLAME ON THE CUSTOMER INSTEAD.

The Home Depot,"Pray your Home Depot appliance delivery goes right, because if it doesn't things get frustrating.","We ordered a new fridge for a recently built In-Laws Apartment. Home Depot agreed to deliver it on Dec. 18th. We really needed the fridge prior to Christmas, so the 18th was perfect. The delivery team showed up on time, checked out the delivery path, and set about unpacking the fridge. That's where things went wrong. The fridge was damaged out of the box. I was promised I would receive a call from their dispatch in the next 20 minutes about scheduling a second delivery for a working unit. 20 minutes passed. No call. I eventually called them and was given the run around. Apparently Home Depot transfers the matter to the manufacturer, leaving it upon them to set up a follow up delivery. In this case, Whirpool. It took several days before we had a rescheduled delivery, one over a week later on the 27th. (It was the 30th, but I got it bumped up.) The messed up thing is that I had to do a lot of follow up calls myself to learn what the hell was going on. I wouldn't have even known it was transfered to Whirpool if I hadn't followed up on things myself. I also noted that if I had simply refused delivery/cancelled the fridge, and then ordered a whole new one through Home Depot I would've had a delivery date of the 26th. That makes no sense and the whole experience has sworn me off using Home Depot for future appliance purchases.",0,2
The Home Depot,Home Depot has The rudest employees out there.,"I stop shopping at the Home Depot in Pinellas Park.Because of rude employees. So I start shopping and buying my stuff from the Home Depot on 22nd Ave., North. I am a first time rental. On renting a truck from the Home Depot. I bought $1000 worth of windows and decided to rent the truck because the winners wouldn’t fit in my car.When I Rented the truck. The guy behind the counter gave me the papers and said I only had to have the truck back on full when I return the truck. I made sure the truck is back on for not thinking that I needed a receipt to show I feel the truck back up. Maybe instead of getting an attitude with me he should’ve told me when I return the truck to bring in the receipt. Half the time when I go get gas at the pump doesn’t print a receipt. And I didn’t think that I would have to go inside to get the receipt As I never go inside to get gas.If the gas pump doesn’t take my card I go to another gas station instead of going inside. So I don’t think your employee should be rude to meSo I don’t think your employee should be rude to me. Your employee wants to complain about two or three dollars worth of gas that I put into the truck.Maybe I should bring the thousand dollars worth of windows back and return them.

So after purchasing the range delivery was set for 3 days from then.When the range was delivered the whole range looked as if it was crushed, and the door wouldn’t even close. So I wasn’t going to sign for it, then the man delivering it offered me $50 off to take it as is. I still continued to down the delivery until they put it back on the truck and left.I called Homedepot to set up a new delivery and they told me, “If the delivery is damage we have nothing to do with it anymore, so here is the number you can call to deal with it”.I then called that number and got the response, “We will give you a call back in 7-10 Businesses days to set up a new delivery.” So it went through my head, 3 days to a delivery for first range and now 7-10 days to set up a date for a new delivery date? Next I went back into Homedepot and asked to cancel my order and just order a new one if it was only 3 days shipping if you order from the store and the response I got was, “after a delivery you can’t cancel your order.”Now 8 days later i get a call to set up a delivery date for 3 days after that. They come back this time with what looks to be undamaged, so it is signed for and they leave. Takes a couple days to get a gas tech to come hook it up and by then the * 48 HOUR * policy is over. After the gas is hooked up the stove top works and the oven does nothing...Called Homedepot again and the same response, “after 48 hours we can’t do anything you will have to go through warranty now.” So now I have to call GE and go through the whole warranty process. They setup a work order number and tell me a tech will call me 24-48 hours to set up an appointment. Champion Appliances Woodstock Ontario calls me back 3 days later and sets up an appointment for 5 days later.5 days later the tech calls asks what the problem is and I explain it to him, and the response I get is, “oh... they didn’t tell me it was a gas range. I’m not licensed to work on gas appliances, the office will have to get you a call.” 2 hours later I get a back from the office to set up an appointment from 3 day when they were going to be there.So, now I haven’t had a stove in almost a month, over Christmas. I had to cancel all my Christmas plans of family coming over for dinner or new years because I don’t have any way to COOK FOOD.Never buy anything that gets delivered or appliances from Homepot EVER worst experience ever. They haven’t tried to compensate or tired to do anything at all to help me. They just want to make the sale then leave you to deal with the rest...",0,1

The number I was given multiple times for a real actual person I could talk to (versus email/chat) is a loop that does not lead to a person.

The Home Depot,Very RUDE customer service,"We purchased a refrigerator there two years ago, When it was only six months out of warrenty it developed six rather large cracks going across the back. When I called customer service they said it was out of warrenty and cosmetic. I explained that I didn't believe that this was a manufacturers defect and that they were deep enough cracks for it to lose cold air. I was very rudely shut down again. I then called the manufacturer and was told the same. I filled a case with the BBB on both companies. The manufacturer called me shortly after and replaced the unit. Last week we decided to replace the other appliances in our kitchen. We spent over six grande at Famous Tates and it did my heart good. HD had gotten so big (because of us) that they can now just treat us like this. It may same them a little in replacing am item, but in the long run they are just sending us the other way.",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot has the absolute worse…Hone Depot Delivery Service is terrible,"Home Depot has the absolute worse delivery service ever. Black Friday I went into the Home Depot Store on Ponce De Leon in Atlanta Ga and paid $3700+ for an appliance set. I ordered this in November. I had a scheduled delivery date of December 16, 2019 from 1:30-5:30 I was at the house at 1pm. I started tracking the appliances at 1:45. The tracker showed delivery between 1:30 and 5:30 with 13 deliveries ahead of me. I tracked the appliance order every 30 minutes until 5:45 pm and the tracker showed the same times and 13 deliveries ahead of me each and every time. At 6 pm I called the 800 number for delivery and it stated the driver was delayed and would call me 30 minutes before delivery. I checked the tracker again and it showed the same delivery time and now 12 deliveries ahead of me. At 7:30 pm I called the Home Depot store. I was placed on hold for about 20 minutes and then the person came back to the phone and stated someone would call me back when they reach the delivery driver. I received a call about 15 minutes later and was told I would be notified when the delivery was coming. Now it is after 8 pm so I questioned the time. I was told by the employee “Oh they will not be coming today, their truck broke down”. The delivery service will call you and let you know when they will deliver your appliances. The next morning I attempted to reach out to the corporate office with no success. The listed number just sent me from one message to the next without allowing me the opportunity to express my concerns to a person in the corporate office. I called the store where I purchased the appliances and asked for a number to the corporate office where I can speak to an individual and I was transferred to the store manager and then to an appliance specialist. I never spoke with anyone from the delivery service regarding my appliances but I spoke with several employees at the store and finally I was told that my new delivery date would be December 30, 2019 which is totally unacceptable but I need my appliances. Now here again on December 30 I am sitting at the house patiently waiting being told that my delivery schedule time is 1:00-5:00 and it is now 8 pm and I have no appliances no courtesy call and an employee from the store saying the drivers delayed but he is coming and that is the only thing I can tell you. I have two wasted days missing work for this extremely poor service. A Hone Depot employee said to me after the first non delivery “ we’ll ma’am Home Depot don’t deliver, it’s a person contracted that does the delivery for Home Depot. Is this company not a representation of Home Depot. This is absolutely ridiculous. I will never shop at Home Depot again. Hone Depot has a 0 star rating from me.",0,1

The Home Depot,Bad experience and I shop here everyday!,"I’m a contractor servicing many clients in the Edmonton, Parkland county, and Strathcona county region. This is the worst treatment I have ever received from any retail outlet I have ever experienced. I choose to shop at Home Depot located in Spruce Grove Alberta because I know everyone there, the staff and management have always treated us very well, they know me and my 2 year old son by name. One bad experience from this location I probably wouldn’t take the time to write this review but this one experience upset me so much that this outweighs all of the good experiences. I purchase not only hundreds but thousands of dollars here every month at this one location in particular whether it’s for personal or business and roughly 2 weeks ago I had purchased 1,400 SQFT of laminate flooring and was told that whatever I do not use I can return if unopened. I lost my receipt for the 11 boxes I was returning and before Christmas asked one of the managers if I could still bring it in. He said that’s fine, quote on quote “your here everyday” I acknowledge the fact that Home Depots return policy is within 30 days with receipt of purchase but I was specifically told it was fine. I loaded up my truck, drove here, unloaded it with my son in arms pushing the cart to the counter and another manager dealt with the situation by being very rude to me. She came back after a few minutes and stated the manager that I had spoken to does not know me “Steve” is my name. There was no purchase made by cash since end of November for that specific flooring, and that he did not tell me to “come in it’s fine”. I was polite and asked when he would be available thinking if he sees who I am he would remember me, she was rude again and told me not to bother him. Customer service or the manager Colleen did not even offer to help me back to my truck with the full cart of flooring while carrying my son in my arm. This is the worst experience I have ever had with any manager or staff in any retail outlet I have shopped at. The disrespect I had received was incredible. I have chosen to shop with Home Depot only because of the good service even when home hardware lumber prices are lower and better quality, I have never even asked Home Depot to match their prices. I left my name and phone number with one of the staff members who knows me to forward it to the manager I originally spoke with when he is available. I will wait for a phone call to resolve this maybe but if not resolved Home Depot will lose my daily business for sure. If this does get corrected I will gladly write a positive review and discard this one.",0,1

The Home Depot,We went to the Home Depot store in…,"We went to the Home Depot store in Terrell, Texas before Christmas and ordered a new dishwasher and a new stove to be delivered Saturday, December 28, 2019. The delivery crew apparently called in sick, which does happen. We were left an automated message to call back on Monday the 30th and reschedule the delivery. We called this morning and were told Thursday the 2nd is the soonest they can deliver now! We've called numerous times, spoke with the warehouse, and tried going through the required chain of command. The dishwasher has messed our floor up and we are stuck without a functional kitchen. My complaint is that, with Home Depot being as large of a company as they are, they have no back-up plan, no Plan B. Really? This is very poor customer service and I am thinking of taking my business to Lowe's. I am very disappointed in Home Depot's customer service as it relates to their home deliveries.",0,1

I asked if anyone was working in the tool are and the gentleman sitting said he would call someone to assist me. I heard the page but waited and waited and waited all while the gentleman and other young man continued chatting at the counter, I was hoping one of them would have came over but that didn’t happen.

So my son and husband took it out in less than 5 minutes and when they went out to let them know its good to go, the truck is gone and so is the dryer. Home depot should start rethinking their delivery service here in NJ because they are incompetent. They will lose customers because of them. Same thing happen to our friend who ordered refrigerator, they just left the item on the sidewalk and had them haul it inside. The customer service also is not helpful. Husband went to home depot to cancel order. Home depot corporate should read all these complaints. Arent they supposed to be customer oriented company?",0,1

The Home Depot,DON'T BUY APPLIANCES FROM HOME DEPOT!!!,"After my experience yesterday, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER APPLIANCE FROM HOME DEPOT. The delivery company they used, Temco, is the most incompetent group of people I've seen in a long time. When they didn't arrive within the 4-hour time window given to me, I called the office and was told they'd be a half hour late (not so bad). When they hadn't arrived after an hour, I called back and was told they'd arrive in a half hour. After that, the driver called and said ""20 minutes."" To shorten the rest of the stringing-along, they finally arrived THREE HOURS past the time window. When I asked the driver why they were so late, he said there were ""complications."" I asked what complications could take three hours. He said he couldn't find a parking place. This was the LAMEST excuse ever, since the delivery was being made to Venice CA, where every delivery driver (especially with a huge truck) knows there will be no parking place--they just have to use the alleys. He was basically blaming me for his being three hours late. No apology--just a really surly, offensive attitude.",0,1
The Home Depot,We ordered a washer and dryer,"We ordered a washer and dryer for my aunt who can no longer leave the house without assistance from Home Depot in Secane a few weeks prior to Thanksgiving. The delivery date was set for 12/18/19; the appliance was scheduled to be delivered between 9-1. The delivery company was no call/no show. We called the store around 1:30 to check the status of the delivery only to learn the company ""forgot"" to put her items on the truck. We were given a 10 day reschedule date despite it being their fault that the items weren't delivered. The Store Manager, ""Johnny"" to date had not return my phone calls. I called the corporate office; reportedly ""Johnny"" didn't return their outreach either. Today the items were supposed to be delivered between 7-11. Again no call/no show with the items. Again I called the store and the Manager was unavailable. Again I called the corporate office and was told the delivery truck was running behind; and that someone would call me soon; and to expect the delivery in a half hour or around noon. At 2p.m.I called back to check the status of the delivery and was told after waiting since 7 a.m. that they tried to deliver the items but no one was home. This is not true of course. They have rescheduled now for 1/3/20. I have not ever received a response from the Store Manager to date. The delivery company is West Side and they are totally unprofessional. Everyone to whom I've spoken at Home Depot has been cavalier about the lack of professionalism displayed by the store manager and the delivery company. The moral of the story, go to LOWES or any place else, and don't use West Side delivery. Extremely disappointed but wise enough to know that I will not be purchasing items from Home Depot again.",0,1
The Home Depot,The worst buying experience ever!!,"I told my husband to not use Lowes. We live in the mountains of Colorado with Home Depot in Avon and Lowe's in Glenwood Springs. Due to bad experiences with Lowes' (who always lives up to their name) we chose HD. We purchased a fridge on November 20 due to the old one going bad. This was not a home remodel. It was an emergency. It is now December 27. The frig we ordered was two weeks late being delivered (not even what we wanted but were told it would arrive quickly). Then it arrived busted. Customer care in the Avon store has been customer careless. The worse buying experience in my adult years. I have phoned 5x, gone to the store 2x. (We do not live close to store...27 miles out). When I got to the store, I told my experience 3 times before I was able to speak to an assistant manager. They were going to follow up and send a new one. That was Dec. 7th. I am writing this review on the 28th having spoken to a customer care (COS) haha yesterday being told she'd get back to me in 30 minutes with some type of information. We have been extremely nice when we've made contact. It is evident no one g.a.s. HD is real quick at issuing credit cards and taking your money. Not quick at all in delivering quality or service. Not in Avon, CO anyway. I have now written to the Executive Team. Let's see if this matters to them.",0,1

So we said come now, they brought in the dishwasher, and said they couldn't install it due to a plumbing issue.

The Home Depot,Terrible shipping service,"Terrible shipping serviceDon't usually write bad reviews, but in this case, I feel it's well warranted.I ordered a refrigerator at the store on black Friday, Nov.29th. I was given a date of Saturday, December 7th for a delivery date. The associate at the store told me I would receive a call to confirm the time and I'd receive a 4 hr window the night before, which I did. I was given a window from 9am to 1pm. On Dec. 7th, I was home with my son the entire morning, nothing. When it got to 12:30 pm and no delivery, I decided to give the delivery company a call. I was informed the deliverers ""attempted to deliver"" the order, but couldn't because conditions in the driveway were ""too icy"", and they were unable to contact anyone at the residence. The order could have been delivered in the back, which delivers could have pulled the truck up and the side door is right there. As I said, both my son and I were home all morning, I never received a phone call or heard a knock on the door. I was told to call customer service, and when I did, I was given a delivery date of after December 17th, no guarantees on the date.At this point, I headed back to the store to cancel the order, and went to Best Buy to purchase the same refrigerator, and they matched my price, 6$ cheaper on the delivery. They offered to deliver it 2 days later and call me with a 2 hr window the night before, which they did. That next morning, I received a call that they were a half hr away at 9am. They arrived a half hr later, took off the back hallway doors, and the refrigerator was in my kitchen in 10 minutes. Due to this experience, I will not order an appliance from home depot again. You'd think that being a big corporation, they'd have more efficient delivery service, but that's not the case. Very poor customer service.",0,1

Customer service refunded my purchase, but by this time, the tool I ordered was out of stock. She found a comparable (even better) tool that she gave to me for less than the original purchase. Had it shipped to my local store this time thinking it might go a little smoother. She told me it should arrive by the 23rd, 24th at the latest. Well here we go again.. Based on the latest tracking report, this has been sitting at a location 40 minutes away for THREE DAYS now. It's Christmas eve and will not arrive in time for Christmas obviously. The rather unpleasant lady I spoke with at the local store said items will sit on a truck until the truck is full, and will then move again.

Delivery was scheduled for December 7, 2019. Refrigerator and dishwasher arrived damaged and were returned. The next delivery date available was December 21, 2019. Wow! 2 weeks with no Refrigerator or Dishwasher. After being on the phone for over an hour, I informed them that 21st date was not a good date and requested the 23rd which was confirmed. On the 21st the delivery driver calls to say they are on the way to deliver? I called the store and informed them of what took place and was reassured that my delivery was scheduled for the 23rd. Because we didn't have a good feeling we called back and was informed that the delivery company could not redeliver until the 31st WTH. The raggedy HD managers offer sorry apologies and state there is nothing they can do. So we ask them do they have Refrigerators in their homes and How would they feel being without one for 3 weeks? Crickets and the Asst Store Manager Alan at the McDonough GA store had the nerve to get an attitude because we are upset. Needless to say we cancelled and went to BrandsMart and getting them delivered on December 23rd imagine that.

We went to pick up the new washing machine from the delivery company and have been trying for a month now to get them to come pick up our old one.

They REFUSED delivery citing ""dangerous conditions"". I get a call from Tennessee advising me of this and claiming they have photos... which they will neither email or text to me. (How do I know they've even photographed my house?). I take my own pics. I call back, which they refuse to take from me either by email or text. Now I'm rescheduled for 12/28. Did I mention my washer died on 12/6 so this is actually a priority for me.Suffice it to say, I will NEVER buy from Home Depot again. If I have even a hiccup next week, I'm cancelling the order and going to Lowes.",0,1
The Home Depot,I recently called in an order to be…,"I recently called in an order to be pulled for lumber and a few other items and was supposed to be notified by text when it was ready, and waited for one hour, two hours, three hours, until I finally sent my crew in to see what the issue was. Home Depot finally texted me after four hours that the order was cancelled after it had been paid for four hours before because of one small box of nails. They wasted a half day of my company’s time for a $6 item (while iam paying my guys). Sadly, this is the second time in a row they have messed up a “pull” order that is supposed to be designed to assist contractors, not hurt them. They need to figure out how to deal with a missing item when orders need to go out fast.",1,2
The Home Depot,Defective products and product rating censorship,"I ordered a lawn mower online because I do not have a vehicle big enough to bring one from the store. First off, delivery did not occur when promised (Fedex) and I was not notified of the delay. Then, when it did arrive, although the box was undamaged (that is, no fault of the delivery) the front wheel was bent in so badly it would not roll. Obviously a manufacturing defect and very poor quality control. I was finally able to get Home Depot to send someone (UPS - great service from them) to pick up the defective mower. I am still waiting for my refund. Even worse, Home Depot will not allow me to warn other customers about my experience and the poor quality of this mower. They have rejected my review THREE times because they say it doesn't meet their guidelines. I can only interpret that as ""We won't accept a negative rating."" No wonder they show an 83% ""would recommend"" rating on this mower. I would recommend NOT buying anything online, sight unseen, from The Home Depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,Purchased a washer which they promised…,Purchased a washer which they promised to deliver a week later. Called me the night before delivery date to tell me order was delayed. Walked to Lowes and purchased one right away and installed it. Spent another week trying to get my refund from store. Had to go argue in store on the 8th day to get my refund. Home depot has lost all my previous kudos. I can now believe all other bad reviews I have been seeing out there.,0,1
The Home Depot,Purchased appliances with promised…,Purchased appliances with promised delivery date a moth after purchasing. This date was one they gave me. No mention at purchase time that they were not in stock! The night before promised delivery date I was contacted by appliances delivery company that appliances were on back ordered and my delivery date would be pushed out another 3 weeks! Immediately went into local store the next morning to me told it was only the refrigerator in backorder but the whole order would be held until everything was in stock. I was told by management that I could wait or rework order with in stock appliances costing me 700.00 more than original order. They eventually said they could take 300 off the difference but that’s all they could do. Terrible customer service at Fenton Michigan Home Depot.,0,1
The Home Depot,Don't Special Order Carpet at this store!,I ordered carpet from Home Depot back in November. I asked for a 15 foot roll and they ordered a 12. When I saw the receipt I called and canceled the order and they refunded my money. Once I received my refund I sent my husband to the store to place the order. Again it was put in wrong so we let them do a reorder with the promise we would have it by the weekend before Thanksgiving. My husband called and called asking where our carpet was. They had horrible communication skills and had my husband's cell number in wrong despite my husband giving him his correct number every time he called. They ended up doing a reorder again with the promise it would be in by this Tuesday. On Wednesday I had to call them to find out my carpet was finally. They had promised a carpet pad upgrade for all my trouble. My husband went to pick it up and as he waited for over 25 minutes for them to locate our carpet pad he kept thinking something was off about the color of our carpet and even thought the roll seemed small. He asked the associate if he could use his tape measure to check it out and the guy said no he didn't have one on him. My husband wheeled the carpet out and by sizing it with his eyes knew something was wrong. He took the carpet in and found 2 other associates to help measure it and sure enough it was a 12 foot roll and not 15. Come to find out the color was wrong too. We were done working with them by that point and demanded a refund. We were promised a refund by today. Along with our trouble they said they would send my husband $100 gift certificate. I called my bank today and I have no pending deposits. This has been a complete nightmare and I will NEVER do business with them again.,0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot has gone the way of Walmart,Home Depot has gone the way of Walmart. I'm tired of having to use the self checkout lanes.

Now that you've been paid, you no longer answer calls, everything is going to voice mail.

The Home Depot,very bad delivery service.,"This is the first bad review I've ever given. Ordered a refrigerator and delivery was scheduled for 3 weeks later. No problem yet. They come to deliver and refuse to go down the driveway because we just had an ice storm. Still no problem even though my wife and I drive down the driveway with no problem since the driveway is flat as a pancake.. Called to reschedule and they tell me 1 1/2 weeks, after Christmas. My refrig is on it's last leg so I call Home D tell them I must have one and they did nothing accept say if you find another somewhere call and cancel the one that they have. I will never buy an appliance from them again.",0,1
The Home Depot,What an organization!,"What an organization! I am a regular customer of store #3810 in Canton, OH and also at Lowe's nearby. When Lowe's offered 50% off on their live Christmas trees but had no inventory of #2 size potted spruce trees I called THD to see if they would match the deal today. The garden center manager Sarah told me to come in and she would take care of me. I picked out a pair of trees, went to the customer service area and cashier April said ""Merry Christmas!"" and gave me the trees at no charge. Not only was this completely unexpected, but I also appreciate that she said ""Merry Christmas"". There are still some businesses who appreciate the reason for the season, and have not restricted their employees from expressing their religious beliefs in their greetings to customers. Just another reason Home Depot is the leader in their industry.",0,5

The Home Depot,Don’t use BLIND service at Home Depot,Had a terrible experience with purchasing/installing new blinds for my home. After 4 calls to our local Home Depot I was finally able to get my install scheduled. It was supposed to take 7-10 days to get installed after my order was received and it’s actually been closer to 4 weeks. Basically lied to me in order to get my business. I did contact their corporate office and nothing was done. To top it all off the contracted installer is finally here for the install appointment and HE JUST LEFT OUR HOME to go and do a measuring job at another appointment. After all the complaints I filed in the weeks leading up to this you would think that Home Depot management or corporate office would have done everything they could have to correct the issue and ensured my install went VERY well. Looks like I’ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.,0,1

The Home Depot,Over charged on sales tax,"I recently purchased a range from Homedepot.com. All went well except I was overcharged on sales tax. I live just outside the city limits of Cottonwood AZ. The sales tax rate in the city is 9.85% while in unincorporated areas of Yavapai county it's 6.35%. Home Depot apparently uses low quality tax software and I only get the run around from customer service via email, text, or telephone. As a result I have paid over $50 in excess tax and I assume it's going to the wrong jurisdiction as well. Every other online retailer I have used gets the tax right, including Lowes.",0,1

Brought it back and was told that a belt got loose andwrapped around a pulley and bent the shaft. I needed something because it was going to snow and the gave me a demo.

The Home Depot,HomeDepot has gone down hill.,"HomeDepot has gone down hill.If I could give a -5, I would.Customers, stay away from the Rock Hill, SC location. There has been so many times I went in to purchase something and they didn't have it. That's even after asking an employee to find it. They check on their phone to see if it's in the system, it is and yet, not on the shelf.They force you to purchase stuff like appliances and bathroom stuff online and the stuff either gets back logged or gets delivered damaged. 1. I needed a washer and dryer so of course I went to HomeDepot. Found a set I liked but couldn't buy it because the associate said they were only floor models and they couldn't sell floor models. So I ordered a set for them to deliver. Here to find out the associate misled me and told me it would be delivered in 5 days. Yea right! After waiting 10 days, I went in and found out I would have to wait an additional 45 days. Total BS!2. I believe in giving second chances, so since I need a bathroom vanity now, I gave them another chance but I had to order a bathroom vanity online and have it delivered. Sounds easy enough right? WRONG! Not only did it finally come almost 2 weeks later then originally stated to me, the sink had a 2 inch deep scratch. So now, I basically have 2 options. Either try and put this heavy vanity/sink into the back of my truck, by myself, to bring to the local store for my money back. Or, have them bring me a new vanity, after paying again for it, so they can take the damaged one back. But not to worry. They will reimburse my first vanity after a month or 2. Yea, hold on, let me go out back to my money tree and peel off another $600.If I was a contractor, I would lose this account. Who wants to wait and get jerked around? Complete BS!After bringing this damaged vanity back, I'll never go to a HomeDepot again! Not even for a screw or a nail.Never had these kind of issues in Wisconsin. This company needs desperate help.",0,1

The Home Depot,I’m writing to share my recent…,"I’m writing to share my recent experience at the Home Depot in Woodbury with the purchase of a Washer and Dryer on 11/27/2019. We purchase what would cost $1,629 which I realize isn’t a large amount of money but as a person who has always recommended home depot as a great hardware store and the ability to go to basically any other store to purchase a washer and dryer the experience and customer service (or lack thereof) thru LG and the Home Depot service center has been beyond terrible. We bought our washer and driver on 11/27/19 and had delivery set up for 12/5/19. When the delivery team dropped off the washer and dryer, I noticed that the washer was scratched. The delivery person said that I should call the LG customer care number and they would give me a damage allowance; the delivery team had already started the washer and they didn’t want to take the unit back since it had already been started and they had two more deliveries that night. I said fine since it was a little scratch, I would just keep it. I called the number for LG and waited 20 minutes before getting thru to someone who I was disconnected from shortly after they answered the call. I then had to call back and wait another 45 minutes before reaching someone who could help me. While I was on the phone with them, I noticed that the washer wasn’t cycling correctly and had an error message and that the dryer was also not cycling properly and was going from 32 minutes to 1 minute and then shutting off. At this point my phone call went from a damage allowance to a replacement set up. I was then transferred again where I was on hold for 30 minutes before talking to someone who told me the replacement set up wouldn’t be delivered until 12/12 6 days after they delivered the first broken set. I was very upset and told them I didn’t even want to keep the units, as how was I supposed to go 6 days without a washer and dryer when I have a family need to do wash for. He insisted that this was the earliest they could get a delivery out and that they would allow for an inconvenience allowance and to call when I received the new shipment. That brings us to 12/12 yesterday when I received the call that the delivery team was on their way. When I asked the driver if there was a person on the delivery qualified to hook up the gas, he said they did not have the replacement units on the truck and that they only have instructions to pick up the units. I then called the LG home depot number again and waited on hold and was transferred and waited 40 minutes for no one to pick up my call. I ended up driving to the Woodbury store myself and talked with the manager of the store and then Maxwell. I sat in the store for an hour in a half last night. They could not locate the units that were supposed to get delivered and were unable to get ahold of anyone to help me last night. I left the store after an hour in a half with no idea where my units were or when they would be delivered. I received a phone call from Maxwell who has done his best (no complaints on him) to track down the units which apparently aren’t even located locally anymore. Not sure how that happened but now the delivery isn’t set until the 19th which unless they can deliver during the day isn’t even going to work as my daughter has a Christmas Concert that night. But again, that is 6 days from the second time they were supposed to be installed. I will be without a washer and dryer for over 22 days from when I first purchased them in store which is ridiculous and not at all how business should be ran. When a company messes up, they should be doing everything they can to rectify the situation and nothing has been done to fix this situation. I’m very disappointed with the lack of customer service, professionalism and the desire to make things right by this company. I have worked in management in retail and I have never seen such lack of effort in trying to make things right with the customer as I have seen with the Management in Home Depot.

Well, the delivery people get here and say they can't remove the two existing appliances. I'm like, wth? I paid for that and showed them my receipt. The driver and I proceed to call OnLine Customer Support to try and resolve the issue and of course neither one of us could ever reach a real person!! TERRIBLE!! So, I call my local HomeDepot's major appliance departement and got the cold shoulder, and from someone I had dealt with regarding this same order a few days earlier who I thought understood that, yet another issue, I had had 2 deliveries canceled at the very last minute, so I really wanted things to go smoothly. Well, she quickly washed her hands of any responsibility and proceeded to try and book me an installation service....NO THANK YOU HOME DEPOT!!Long story short, Home Depot OnLine does a little bit of gray advertising. They only haul away what has already been disconnected....like really? Also, online purchaser beware, they only install certain appliances so make sure you don't erroroneously expect an install. The OnLine site does not clearly explain that you must add on/purchase a separate installation service. A simple change to the website that prompts users to accept or decline that when they are purchasing those types of appliances would certainly eliminate that issue.SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! on HomeDepot. I refused delivery by the way and will be purchasing from another Retailer!Oh, and my venting to my friends and family have been received with, ""yeah, we don't shop online appliances with Home Depot...terrible service.""",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot Doesn’t Hold True On Their Promotions,"We were sent a Home Depot promotion by Tuff Shed between 8/29/19 - 9/4/19 to get 10% off the base price of a Sundance series Tuff Shed and get an additional 5% off plus 24 months no interest financing if you make the purchase with your Home Depot consumer credit card. We decide to do that. We went to the store and since we didn’t have the Home Depot credit card we opened an account to get the 5%. If not for the 5% additional credit, we would have just paid cash. The shed was $13,000. They use Citi and at the time the max amount they would open a new account for was $8,000 so we were told by Home Depot for my wife to open an account for the remaining amount and we would get the 5% on both accounts since. This was a specific question we asked and was told we would get the 5% of my account and her account. My 5% was equal to $400 and hers was $266. We were told it would take a couple cycles for the 5% to be issued. Well after weeks and weeks of getting the run around and fighting with Home Depot and lots of aggravation we finally got the 5% on my account and $28 credit because we had to make the minimum payment in the meantime but they would not issue the 5% credit on my wifes account as we were promised! Called the Westport Rd, Louisville, Ky store talked with the store mgr and CS magr again gets the run around. They say they will call us and never do. I call em back to check on it, get the run around and tell me they will call us one way or another and never follow through. They don’t do what they said they would do hoping we wold get tired of it and forget it. Needless to say we have to pay her account off, cut up the card, tell em what we think of their promotions and tell em to close the account. I had to make a purchase on my account to get the $28 credit and when the statement comes, I’ll do the same. Thanks Home Depot for nothing!",0,1

The Home Depot,RE-Carpet installation,"RE-Carpet installationMy husband and I decided to install carpet 149 yrds worth in our home that we are preparing to sell. My husband went and spoke with a flooring specialist 10/31/19. He was very nice and informative. A measurement of the sq footage was scheduled, the only thing my husband had forgot at home was a swatch of the exact carpet that we had decided on that I had picked up from Home Depot several months earlier. The flooring specialist assured my husband that it wouldn't be a problem and just to give it to the representative that came out to measure the house. This is exactly what he did on or about Nov 6th when the house was measured. The estimate was written and we agreed to the price, and sq footage. We didn't think we had to go over what the representative of Home Depot had written in his estimate since he had carried the swatch around the whole time he had measured the house ( buyer beware). Three weeks went by and on the day of installation 2 days before Thanksgiving when we had 8 people coming and figured we would set up the beds and move furniture back into the house as quickly as possible the night before Thanksgiving after the installation was finished and before the snow storm followed by days of rain that were forecast, .....we discovered (before the third party installer even got the carpet off the truck) the carpet was wrong. Not just the wrong color, the wrong weight, and the wrong grade. We had ordered brown flecked with forest green, red, dark brown. My husband was now standing at the back of the installer's truck looking at a whole lot of grey carpet. We sent the installer away and told them we would contact Home Depot. At that point we pulled out the paperwork and the swatch and our first discovery was that the sku# and the name of the carpet written into the estimate was wrong. Ok we will own not checking but names of carpet change all the time and with a swatch you (I) thought maybe the name had been changed and this was the new sku# for the original. Not the case a cheaper weight carpet, a cheaper grade, and a less then desireable color had been ordered. We then called the store and were told we needed to show up in person to handle this matter. It's 35 minutes away but we got in the car and went. Once we arrived we were told that the carpet we had originally ordered was no longer MANUFACTURED or carried by Home Depot. What in the actual hell??? Three weeks prior we were not told this. I want to remind you this was supposed to be Installed in two days because of the Thanksgiving holiday. We were then told by the store manager of the Chico, California Home Depot the she would price match to the original swatch and they would get together several options for us to choose from but it might take some time. We quickly went home and put all the beds back together, but left our furniture on the porch covered thinking this couldn't possibly take another 3 weeks because it had not been our mistake and that Home Depot would definitely make this right monetarily and convenance wise for us ...their customer that had already paid in full. Again we were let down. Not only did they not come up with a quick solution but did not even come up with anything comparable, and we were told that the people above the store manager had decided not to price match the original swatch like she had promised us. We later found out that they had not even ordered enough originally to complete the install. We had originally paid $4 a sq ft verified by another carpet company and were given a single choice of a carpet that cost $1.65. Again what in the actual hell? At this point my Mother's desk had been on my porch in the rain covered by a tarp for almost a week and carpet installation wasn’t even on the horizon. Not a very customer friendly experience and we have since decided we will no longer give our money (any of it) to Home Depot anymore we are switching to Lowe's for all our home improvement needs. We are also spreading the word. Home Depot stands by nothing, they have gotten to big to care that their customers have brought hard earned monies to their store to purchase. This is our second really negitive experience with Home Depot's flooring department. We also had an issue in our last home of not honoring a re-stretch of carpet they installed with a lifetime warranty. I hope for the best for us and at this point it requires a full refund. Which we did receive without issue. Thank you to the all whom helped us resolve this issue.",0,1

The Home Depot,Buyer Beware!!  Appliances delivered damaged from delivery contractor,We just got a Whirlpool dishwasher delivered today that was purchased at the Home Depot. The delivery was made by one of Home Depot's contract delivery companies. The delivery guy just had me sign and didn't specify that I had to inspect the appliance (HE KNEW HE WAS DELIVERING A DAMAGED PRODUCT). When I went to open the box immediately after he left I noticed the box was drenched. Upon opening the box the insulation was soaked and there was water running down the sides of the dishwasher. I immediately called the delivery company and Homedepot.com. At first they acted like they were going to resolve the issue. THey proceeded to call Maytag to get a replacement dishwasher to which Maytag refuses to replace. The delivery company will not own up that they delivered a damaged product since I signed and Homedepot refuses to do anything about it. What I was told was to let it air out then install and see if it has any issues. Are you KIDDING ME??!! We paid 470.00 to have these crooks tell us to let it dry out. I called within 15/20 mins from delivery. THis is unacceptable especially after all the money we have spent at Home Depot. From now on my business will go elsewhere.,0,1

When we did look at the items, our brand new refrigerator has a huge dent in it. And our dryer doesnt heat up. We called and they were rude to my wife saying they did us a favor to replace the door. Lol...a favor. They will not reimburse us for not having a dryer for a week until a technician comes and if he has to order parts for our brand new dryer, it could be much longer. With all the money it cost to get all this stuff, I would recommend going anywhere else. They were so nice before purchasing, and the complete opposite after.",0,1

I NEVER heard back and now the request shows it has been pulled. I will never refer anyone to use Home Depot. This is not how you treat people that want your business. You should review your process!,0,1

The Home Depot,DO NOT purchase appliances or large items from Home Depot,"﻿On 11/17/19 myself and my husband went to the Home Depot (hereinafter “HD”) located at 1100 S. Progress Ave., Meridian, ID 83642. We visit this location quite often and spend a generous amount of money there and online via cash, credit and on our HD card. We went on this day to purchase a clothes dryer as our dryer at the time recently died. It was imperative that we received this dryer by 11/23/19 as we were leaving to go out of town very early 11/24/19 and would be gone a week. We explained this to the HD rep in the appliance Dept. We went ahead and purchased the dryer on our HD card for $427.39 as she GUARANTEED we would receive the dryer on 11/23/19 (by then it would be a week since I did laundry due to the fact that we didn’t have a dryer and desperately needed to do laundry on 11/23/19 in order to pack so we could catch our flight early 11/24/19). On 11/22/19 my husband contacted the HD where we bought the dryer to just see if we could get an estimated delivery time the following day. To our extreme surprise and major disappointment he was told that the delivery was not in the system and we would need to reschedule. Beyond upsetting to hear this to say the least, when we were guaranteed delivery on 11/23/19; otherwise we wouldn’t have purchased it. My husband then had to leave work and go to HD to find out what happened and what was going on as this was a serious situation for us. When he got to HD he met w/ a rep who showed him the computer screen showing where the delivery should have been entered but was not. He gave us options to either buy a dryer we didn’t even want and we’d get $50 off but w/ no delivery so would have to pick it up ourselves or we could get our original dryer on 12/3/19. How is it possible that we order a dryer on 11/17/19 and have to wait till 12/3/19 to get it?? Ridiculous. After a lot of contemplating and tears we decided to not settle for a dryer we didn’t even want and to get a full refund and figure something else out. We were very upset! My husband, who was already missing work, had to travel around town to hopefully find another dryer for us. He thankfully ended up finding the same dryer at another company and had to continue missing work to find someone w/ a truck and inconvenience someone else in order to help us pick it up. After all of this, on the evening of 11/22/19, I received an automated call saying our dryer from HD would be delivered between 8-12 on Saturday morn (11/23/19). Furious, I called HD in Meridian, spoke to another rep, explained to her the situation and told her that we got a dryer already and that delivery better not happen after we were told it was canceled and just jumped hoops to get a different one. She said she would call the other rep to make sure. Amazingly, at 8:00 am on Sat morning 11/23/19 I received a voicemail from a driver saying he had our dryer and would be to our house to deliver in 20 minutes. I called him back and left him a voicemail explaining a small part of the situation and told him not to deliver the dryer to our house. This whole situation is unbelievable to us. After all the trouble WE went through to rectify this situation and my husband having to miss hours of work and travel around the city to figure this out we then find out we could’ve had the delivery. HD gave us no help and clearly has communication issues w/ it’s employees and 3rd parties. We’ve never encountered a place that runs their business like this. We spend a lot of money at HD and for this to be what we get in return as a thank you is sickening. We even planned to purchase other larger items and appliances from HD down the road but we will now take our business elsewhere. This was a complete failure on HDs part and we could not be more disappointed on how this was handled and w/ no apology by anyone, especially as being loyal and constant paying customers. This whole thing was a HUGE inconvenience to us and showed us that clearly HD has some serious issues and does not have its stuff together as it portrays. It’s a bigger slap in the face that I emailed this complaint to HDs customer service on Dec 1 requesting a response and as of today’s date, Dec 6, we haven’t heard a word. They won’t be getting our another penny from us.",0,1

The Home Depot,Worst customer service I have ever…,"Worst customer service I have ever encountered! I bought a new dishwasher and had it delivered yesterday. When I got home from work and prepared to install it I found that the unit was missing the AC adapter plug to wire my power cord into. After searching endlessly to verify that it was truly missing I called the store to resolve the issue....while being placed on hold I was abled to take a shower, change my clothes, drive to the store and begin talking to someone in appliences before anyone picked up...so I hung up my phone...following this, the floor representative and store manager were of no help at all. I was told I had to deal with GE directly. They would not let me exchange the product, return the product, or even just get the adapter plug off the floor model so I could Finnish my install...after 2 hours of getting the ""run around"" I ended up scheduling a warranty service call with GE to come out with the part and install my dishwasher a week from now! Even the rep from GE said it was crazy and the store should really help me out. The manager at the store refused to help in any way at all and now I am another week away from having my dishwasher. I will never shop at Home Depot again after this experience. I can get everything I need at other stores and I will advise everyone else I know to do the same thing....products are just products, everyone has them to sell, it's the customer service that sets businesses apart and Home Depot has the worst and least amount of empathy for it's customers that I have ever seen!",0,1

The Home Depot,"Unhelpful customer service, with an attitude","Home Depot customer service for online sales is one of the worst I have encountered. I ordered several items during Black Friday sales. Most of them were shipped using UPS, and those are en route and I don't expect any issues. UPS is legit. Two of the items were shipped via OnTrac (in my experience, the worst delivery service on planet earth, and my current experience backs that up). And that delivery has been delayed, and delayed, and delayed. It's been day after day of ""it will be redelivered tomorrow""... OnTrac says ""redelivered"" but since their online tracking system has been saying that day after day, even when the package is nowhere in my area yet, that's a complete misnomer. I called Home Depot customer service after the 2nd ""redeliver tomorrow"" delay, and they told me to wait until the next day, and if it still hadn't been delivered, then they could do something about it. Rather than wait just the 1 day, I waited through 2 days and 2 additional OnTrac delays with ""redeliver tomorrow"" and then called Home Depot once more. Eighteen minutes on hold before I talked to an agent. After a half-hour or so of conversation and multiple holds while she went to check on things, I was cut off and had to re-call. Wait on hold for another 25 minutes. Finally talk to an agent. The last agent hadn't documented anything that she had been working on for me, so I reviewed all of that for the guy who was now ""helping"" me, and ended up with the last agent was working on recalling the package and shipping a new package out via UPS? ""Nope, can't do that."" I remind him that's what the woman I was talking to was working on, he comes up with attitude. ""No, we don't do that."" So I suggest, why don't we do a ""pick up at my local store"" and I'll just get it there. Nope. They can't do that because online orders can't be converted to store pickup. Even though as a consumer I could have selected that option at the time of the order, they can't manage that in their system according to this guy... but by the attitude he's throwing, I get the impression he just doesn't want to. At this point, I point out that I called to solve a problem and he's doesn't seem interested in doing anything... he's not suggesting a solution, and he's rejecting what the previous agent was working on, and rejecting my suggestion. ""Yeah, that's right, we can't help you."" Bottom line, Home Depot customer service for their online sales is unable or unwilling (I think it's a bit of the former and lot of the latter) to actually provide service.",0,1

On December 3rd I received notice that my order had been delivered on December 3rd. Needless to say I was excited that my order had been received prior to the expected delivery date. There was however 1 problem, my order had not been delivered to the address provided at the time of the order. I thought maybe my order had been placed in a safe place by my building Super, but found out this was not the case. After the Super reviewing the video of the lobby of our building it was determined that the box in question had never entered the building. I contacted Home Depot customer service and was first told to contact my bank, reverse the charges and if I like replace the order. I requested and was connected to a supervisor who was much more helpful, and only after my insistence was it determined that my order was delivered to the wrong address. There solution was to restart the entire process rather than giving any preference to the customer even tho the mistake was on their or 1 of their vendors fault.",0,1
The Home Depot,YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT UNTIL HOME DEPOT GETS AROUND TO YOUR REFUND!!!,"I mean as a business, I am in the business of making my customers happy with the occasional Blip. But Home Depot takes the award for CUSTOMER LAST. I purchased a stove from Central Albany Home Depot first week of November. They delivered wrong stove on November 12th and I refused to take it. Now the fun begins!. Called on Wednesday, Nov. 13th to request a refund and was told it will take 5-7 business days for refund because Home Depot needs their third party delivery contractors to return wrong delivered stove to GE where GE will make adjustments to return monies because Home Depot does not store appliances so they need to wait until GE return the money I paid Home Depot before they can refund me the money. By this time it will take 7-10 business days. It is 17 business days and I may get my refund on the 18th business day which is Friday, December 6th, 2019 and even this is not a guarantee. SO my advice to any individual looking to buy an appliance from HOME DEPOT do so knowing that if you refuse to accept delivery on a wrong delivery item from HOME DEPOT it may take a total of 18-21 business days which is being gracious so I believe it is closer to 31 business days. So if you are in a hurry like us as a business HOME DEPOT is not the store for you actually a Home Depot rep. told us to purchase from another store which makes sense but this is after the fact. HOME DEPOT as a big BRAND does not care about customer satisfaction when it comes to money and like one rep told us on HOME DEPOT's website the terms and conditions states that HOME DEPOT can change its policy any time. SO take that CUSTOMERS!!! You NEED To WAIT UNTIL Home Depot gets around to your refund!!",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot delivery services.,"Home Depot of Salisbury Md was very helpful but their delivery service was very disappointing and dissatisfying! Highly upset with the communication and delivery drivers. I scheduled my delivery to be on 11/11/19 they did not call or show with my stove, washer or dryer. I called the company who was scheduled to delivery that evening they advised me they “forgot about me.” I understand it’s a busy time of year and rescheduled my delivery and installation. 11/19/19 was my next delivery and INSTALLATION date. This time they did show up but did NOT install what I paid extra to be installed, also forgot my dryer vent. Again I called for the delivery service to come and install my appliances, 11/26 the week of thanksgiving they were scheduled to come out. Yet again no call no show! At this point I’m extremely upset and had to cancel thanksgiving at my residence because I did not have my stove install like instructed. Next installation was for Tuesday 12/3/19, they finally came to properly installed my stove, washer and dryer, at this point I have gone WEEKS without a washer, dryer and stove. I’m a single mother of 3 including twins that are 21 months of age. We have had to go to the laundromat because of the inconvenience of this company! On top of coming out of pocket for the use of the laundromat we have also had to call delivery or take out for our dinner. I called the delivery service again to explain my situation and all they could do was refund my installation charges which was no more than 50$! Poor management and because of this situation I will no longer be ordering from any Home Depot that uses this company! Absolutely ridiculous!",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot and LG are terrible.,"Very disappointed in the LG dryer we purchased from Home Depot on 8/2/19. We had two service calls regarding the drum due to a thumping sound it was making. When the replacement drum was installed, it did not work. The technician took it back out of the dryer and made adjustments on the original drum then put it back in. The loud thumping sound was better. Then the third service call was placed due to a loud squeaking and rattling sound the dryer was making. The technician said the motor is bad. Well, a fourth service was scheduled by LG without our knowledge with a different service place from 12-5 during the hours we are working (we already took off of work for other service calls). We feel it is time for a replacement dryer. LG will not hear of that. Home Depot can only help in the first 48 hours. What a joke. All they will do is give the customer LG’s customer service number. My Hisband took off for the fourth service call on the dryer only to find out the technician couldn’t get the motor for our dryer. Now we have a technician coming December 2nd to replace the motor. Good thing, because the dryer stopped working now. We will NEVER buy another appliance from a Home Depot and NEVER another LG product. We will tell everyone we know about this awful experience.",0,1

The Home Depot,"Ordering From Home depot online is a Joke!,Don't waste Your Time!","Ordered a Cordless angle Grinder online. During placement of order contacted customer service regarding promotion discount coupon or gift card in my possession. Was informed that item was eligible for 20% discount and would be applied to credit card purchase. Long Story Short.., Took discount off original price not sale price , so no discount! brought this to cashier and then Manager attention, another waste of time.told me that discount was applied when it wasn't basically was trying to sell me something at regular price instead of online promotion price. Buyer Beware!! Review all online purchase statements before wasting your time purchasing an item from home depot on line and driving to pick it up.

Then they said they would be delivered today, they were not. I call customer service & he said that the delivery date is not a guarantee, as my contractor waits. He could not tell me when it would be there. The “track my package” says that it is only 2 hours away from me but when I asked how many days it would take for it to travel 2 hours, he said to, “count on several more.”Also, I ordered a shower from them that I paid for & then the order was cancelled twice due to stock issues that were not synched properly. That took several LONG phone calls to try to rectify. Then they told me that they had it & would find a way to get it to me & never called me back as promised, so I had to order from another company. What a mess!! Go to Lowe’s because Home Depot claims they can get things to you sooner than Lowe’s but never delivers on their promises.",0,1

The Home Depot,Horrible customer service,"I just left the Home Depot store in Portage, MI. I wanted to purchase a couple sheets of OSB and some lumber for a home project. I needed the OSB cut in half. Easy task at the large panel saw in the middle of the lumber department. After a couple of minutes i went up front and asked the cash register attendant to call someone to the saw. I waited almost 15 minutes and no one showed. At one point an employee who was on a fork truck loading material on the floor in an adjacent aisle walked up to the saw and picked up a couple of boards and walked away. When I went back to the cashier attendant, i was told i would have to wait until the material was unloaded to the aisle. I reported this to the customer service desk and left the store. I will take my business to Lowes.",0,1
The Home Depot,No customer service for appliance delivery,"I ordered a dishwasher online. 2 days later I was given a delivery window that did not work for me. I spoke with the delivery person to reschedule and was told it would be 2 weeks before I could get the delivery. I told him I wanted to cancel the order and waited for him to come back on the phone to say the order was cancelled and I should see the refund in 10-12 business days. At the end of that time no credit was given, and I called back. They told me because I had not called the store in addition to the delivery person I had not canceled and needed to cancel through the store. They confirmed my cancellation. When I asked for a confirmation number for the cancellation they said there was no confirmation number and I would receive an email...which did not come. I spoke with another agent later who sent me the written notes of the cancellation. It stated that my cancellation was pending because the delivery was in transit! I had to call back a third time, and finally got a PDF copy of the cancellation in an email. I will still need to wait 3-7 business days to see the refund. What a nightmare! So disappointed with Home Depot. Lowe's did a great job for me instead.",0,1

I was greeted at the entrance and told there were great buys. What I got were two guys staring at computer screen. One stood up and in short, told me the prices were on the machines and he didn't know of any rebates on Electrolux.There are rebates on all the Electrolux machines, and local gas company and other energy tax incentives he knew nothing of.The sales person uttered a few words, mostly just NO three times. And of course, the prices are in the machines. I have a renovation going on. HD lost at least 10,000 because of the above.I gave it a real effort to check out HD, but never again.",0,1
The Home Depot,No Customer Service Just Our Money,"Once the purchase is made it’s nothing but down hill, train wreck, travesty. They were my last option to buy from because I needed washer/dryer sooner than later. They delivered on Saturday and you only have 48 hours to report damages. If you call the number on the paperwork provided they are closed. I was beyond persistent and called every phone and directly to the manufacturer and waited and waited until I spoke to a person. I even went back to the store and made them aware. The delivery team aren’t equalized to anything beyond manual labor. They hooked up the machines, washer hoses leaked and was dented, there were also issues with the dryer door which they were not equipped to handle. More time off a second team comes out and tells us the dryer is defective. HD wants me to take a minimal amount for the dented washer, which I refused. After countless phone calls I just told them to come get them and give me back my money. A week later the machines get picked up and I’m supposed to get my refund within 3 to 5 days. This didn’t happen. I called, emailed, went to store. Even after going to store to get refund my money wasn’t refunded back to CC until seven days later.HD offers the most abhorrent customer service ever. They don’t own their mistakes and are in no hurry to fix them. Their customer don’t matter once the purchase is made.",0,1

The Home Depot,Don't trust you will get what you paid. They are good at refusing to do the job!!!,"WARNING: Purchase appliances from Home Depot is a disaster. If you want to keep out of trouble, find other reputable sellers like Costco, Best Buy, etc., ESPECIALLY if you are not WHITE.tl;dr. I paid Home Depot to install new appliance purchased from them, but they refused to do it TWICE without giving any reasonable explanation. So they either1. unprofessional, lacks technical skills or training, or2. just don't want to do the work (my laundry room is on upstairs, so they need to move washer/dryer up and down), or3. are racists, because I am Asian.Long story version: I purchased washer/dryer/styler from Home Depot, because their price is fair and provide installation service. But unfortunately, it is a total SPAM. On the first delivery, they found the washer was damaged. I asked them to install other appliances, they refused because they said they must be installed together.On the second delivery, the delivery men checked my laundry room and told me they can't do installation because the water outlet box in my laundry room is too small, so it can't fit the LG Sidekick washer (the washer in the pedestal). But in fact, before I purchased them, I went to Home Depot to ask the installation, the shop associate confirmed the pedestal washer doesn't have special requirements for the outlet box. I also checked LG's official installation video, it shows the regular outlet box. And later after the delivery men left, I contacted LG USA customer service, they also double confirmed it doesn't have special requirements. I explained to them I have double confirmed with Home Depot shop associate and online video, but they just said no without any reasonable explanation. They didn't even measure my current box, and didn't tell me what size is ""bigger"" enough. On the following day, I hired a general contractor to my home to help install the washer and dryer. We installed them successfully, they fit my outlet box perfectly, which means both Home Depot shop associate and LG customer service are all correct, but the Home Depot delivery men are totally wrong.I called Home Depot and spoke with the store manager. The guy inisisted his delivery men did the right thing because they ""followed LG installation spec"". I asked him to show me the installation spec, but they refused. Home Depot didn't even fully refund me the installation fee I paid with the appliances! I have filed a complaint to BBB. I didn't expect it could help a lot, just want everyone to be aware of this kind of SPAM. Don't think you will get what you paid always, they can refuse the work anytime!!!",0,1

The Home Depot,Horrible delivery company-terrible service!,"I have always loved working with Home Depot, despite a mishap with their delivery company Forward Air, which dropped my washing machine and still attempted to deliver it damaged with the box crushed and showing a damaged appliance. However, this latest mishap of waiting over a month for a refrigerator for my office and delivery instructions both on the order (and delivery slip) and verbal instructions to the driver himself were not followed. Note: the company they have contracted with to delivery products to your home CANNOT enter a federal building, they only have three drivers that can access a federal facility. My question, why would Home Depot allow these people to enter your home and install products when they cannot enter a work place? I will never purchase another appliance from Home Depot again!",0,1
The Home Depot,Story time......,"Story time......So, yesterday I was in my local Home Depot shopping for a new bathroom cabinet. I utilized the veteran parking spaces cause they are upfront and i got something big to get into my POV. As I'm looking around at the different varieties they had I hear from behind me ""can I help you?"". Not even a Sir or mister came that nasty sewer hole, how friggin rude is that? I wanted to scream ""You don't know me! Is this how you address all your customers?"" but I didnt. I then calm my mind down by stroking my fingers through the beard I'm now finally allowed to grow. I never did understand that, I mean they had me working in the back of a friggen supply warehouse on Camp Devil Dog where nobody saw me ever but I still had to buy razor blades. I digress. Well back in the isle. I slowly turn to this young man with barely any bass in his voice and told him I was ""fine"". I already knew the dimensions of the cabinet I need, i was just choosing the style and didn't need some nasty civilians help. Then he has the audacity to reply back ""well if you do need anything, I'll be right around the corner"". I wanted to explode again. Didn't you friggen hear me the first time? Is there something majorly wrong with you brain housing group? I said I was FINE! End of story. I wanted to shout that out so bad.I found a cabinet that I wanted without the help of that little guy help and loaded it myself onto my cart. I began to make my journey to the check out isle with my item. Of course, there is a long line and only one little girl who probably cant start a lawnmower, that works at a hardware store, slowly checking out customers with only one register.....that's friggin all, one person, one register. Finally make it up there, show my VA card first and I get the response ""what's this?"" My blood was already boiling from that boy bothering me, like he couldn't read my veteran shirt that states to 'stay back'. In my calmest voice I could muster I slowly said ""your company gives a veteran discount, I would like that please"". The blank stare on her face said it all. You mean to tell me that I'm the only veteran in this town that has ever done this before in the history of this establishment? I asked for the manager to quickly get this cleared up, because people were getting too close behind me and I was getting close to reaction mode.In the end, the only bright spot of this trip was that I was able to park close to quickly load my purchase. I'm considering other places to shop for my home improvement needs.",0,1

We had @HomeDepot come out on multiple times to conduct multiple measuring, inspections, pull sheetrock off wall, remove molding, and order two separate doors. In each case, the result was failure. Due to the lack of ability on servicing what you sell, we had to choose another vendor to complete the task, with additional cost to us. Going forward we will now have two different entry doors on our home. One from Home Depot, and one from another vendor.

I am usually transferred multiple times, if I get someone to order. I have called and waited over 20 minutes. I've also called, drove to the store, and they still transfer me back and forth. Reached the store before I got an answer 47 minutes with no answer. Right now I've called 5 times and they wont answer. Their commercial order and pickup doesn't work if you cant get anyone on the phone to place your order. I decided to order my lumber from Homewood today, the small amount I was saving, was just not worth the hassle. This was a $6K bid.",0,1

The Home Depot,I needed a cheap window for a staircase…,I needed a cheap window for a staircase in my rental property. I measured it and went to the store and priced it out at $128 plus installation. There were signs all over having $149 installation special. I tried to order window but was told that I must have somebody come out to measure the window and that the installation price might be different. I made an appointment and when the lady called me to verify that I was going to meet her as I was driving to the property I explained to her what I was trying to achieve. That's when I was informed that I can't get the window I found at the store and the advertised install price. The window I was hoping to get under $300 installed now became $800. What a ripoff to have false advertising.,0,1

I had never been told that this would be necessary; my husband and I came in initially and we were charged a deposit for the ovens as well as an installation fee from the company hired to install the item. I had trouble initially contacting the installation company, and had to call Home Depot to make the arrangements. At no time was I told that the ovens hadn't been ordered. I have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere. This is the last time I'll ever. do business here.",0,1

The Home Depot,Award goes to rudest employee of the year,Worst experience of my life! I have always shopped at the store on magwood and after tonight I will never return. My son was having a meltdown in the store over chips which I was trying to correct while also using the self check out since no regular lines were open. The older lady with short brown hair that was monitoring the self check out at 720 pm on Saturday November 9th decided it was her place to repeat me very rudely when I asked my son to please stop and slapped my receipt in my hand. Never have I had such disrespectful service towards my son and myself. He has been diagnosed with autism and struggles with shopping in public. I have not felt more disrespected and put down than I have tonight by this employee. I am so upset by this that I will be returning what I purchased tonight and taking my business elsewhere.,0,1
The Home Depot,totally unacceptable customer service…,totally unacceptable customer service at the Manteca store today. I needed to get a blower and extension cord and knew exactly what I wanted. Both items were very close to the end of the aisle but both aisles were blocked off and nobody was around. Two Associates did walk up to me and asked me if I needed help. I was told that somebody is coming and they just walked off. In the meantime a husband and wife and another customer came and we're waiting to a husband and wife and another customer came and we're waiting to go down the isle. Two different Associates came walking down the aisle with two more barricades and we're mentioning they had the block off the main aisle. By this time there were five customers waiting to buy things. Instead of helping the customers who are all waiting they were very rude and told us it's not their fault it's the companies. In my opinion they could have waited a few more minutes. I thought Home Depot is in the business to make money not tick off customers. I left my cary with over $100 of items and left the store. I'm canceling my account they no longer have my business.,0,1

So if I hadn't contacted them twice, they would have NOT refunded my money or shipped the order. So they apologized and sent me a returned item refund notice via email.

Now...who am I going to listen too? I got sick to my stomach knowing he's trying to upsale us to a product that wasn't what were were told to buy.

Weeks later I was still calling and filing complaints finally after filing 5 claims the installer's company came to my house and did an investigation and we then received a letter of rejection; stating the installer didn't take the dishwasher into my house and in the same letter stated I signed that it had been installed with no damages. No one has done anything to make anything correct other than Home Depot refunded the money for the installation that never happened.

The Home Depot,I wanted a Dishwasher. I got a headache.,"I wanted a Dishwasher, I got a headache instead.3 weeks ago I purchased a Samsung dishwasher from the Home Depot. 3 days later, I took off from work to meet the installers and have it installed. Everything appeared to be in order when they installed it, but later that night I went to do a load of dishes and some error lights came on and the dishwasher stopped working. I called Home Depot and they agreed to send another one out and rescheduled another delivery.The installation team came out, removed the old dishwasher and installed a new one. Again, everything appeared to be working. I left and went back to work. Later that evening I returned home prepared to do a load of dishes. 20 minutes into the wash cycle another set of lights comes on and the dishwasher stops working. So I looked in the owners manual and the error code said the dishwasher wasn’t getting water. I checked the supply line, it was open and there was water in the dishwasher.The next day I went to the Home Depot and I spoke to someone in the appliance dept who assured me they would take care of the problem by sending someone out to our home to fix it. So days later I get to take off a third time from work to meet, what turns out to be the same installer who installed the first dishwasher. He told me it was installed properly and that I would have to contact Home Depot. At this point, I’m starting to get aggravated at all the hoops I had to jump thru to get a dishwasher.So I drove my unhappy butt down to the Home Depot and told them that I no longer wanted a Samsung Dishwasher, that I wanted a different model instead. I was told that I would have to schedule another appoint at my house to return the dishwasher and then purchase another dishwasher to be deliver and yet another date.I didn’t really think it was fair that I should have to take off 2 more times from work to end up with a working dishwasher. So I told Tina the manager that arrangement would be unacceptable. They could deliver a new dishwasher and remove the non working dishwasher at the same time. I would have been willing to pay the difference for a better model. Apparently giving me a refund and allowing me to pay the difference was against Home Depot’s policy. So I had to purchase another dishwasher it was Floor Model Bosch dishwasher. I was assured at the time I paid for it that the dishwasher would be scheduled for delivery as soon as we got back from vacation.Upon my return from vacation. I went in to schedule the delivery of our new Bosch Dishwasher, when I was told by Tina the General Manager that home deport doesn’t deliver floor models. Needless to say I was beyond angry at this point. She never made an apology, she just cited company policy. I promptly told Tina that I wanted to return everything and receive a refund. She quickly passed us of to Tessa a customer service associate who was equally uninterested in delivering any type of customer service. I then went home and removed the non working Samsung myself (as it was easier than taking another half a day of work off, so that Home Depot could pick it up) retuned and received a refund. Tina the manager took special care to make sure that every hose, nut and bolt was accounted for, but she never once said I’m sorry that you had to go thru all of this.I own 2 businesses and a put tremendous value in making my customers happy. Over the course of 3 weeks, I have made at least 6 trips to the store and had at least as many phone calls. Each time Home Depot had the opportunity to solve my problem and they chose not to, each time citing this policy or that policy. My problem was that I just wanted a working dishwasher, delivered and installed just like I paid for twice. I didn’t ask for anything for free. I just wanted a dishwasher.If Tina the General Manager of Home Depot cared half as much how I was affected during this process, rather than how Home Depot would be affected. They would still have a customer. I will never be back.",0,1

The Home Depot,Cabinet and Countertop Installation Service,"I had a kitchen project done by the Home Depot in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Store 1976.The total experience was not that great overall. There was several design miscommunications.The company they recommend, Absolute Construction is way over priced. When I tried to voice my concern, Christian the manager didn't seem to care about my opinion. Reading something in a contract, and seeing the actual work done, then the expense of the project. The expense didn't seem justifiable. The worker that showed up to install the cabinets, damaged my newly painted walls in 5 different locations. When I told Absolute about it, all they were concerned about was a good review. Christian was supposed to call me back after the project was completed, to see if I still felt the same way, but he never followed up.The only good things about the project were the quality of the cabinets, and the countertop company. MSI or now the Countertop Factory Midwest, was great to deal with. Visiting the show room to pick out the granite was quick and easy. The installation was great, fast and professional. If I had to do it over, I would definitely find my own workers to install the cabinets.....I figure it would be about half the price of what Absolute charged. Highly disappointed overall.",0,2

The Home Depot,Kitchen Remodel Nightmare,"My husband I saved for years to remodel our kitchen at our home, which was originally built in 1964. We worked with Pam Taylor, a kitchen and design consultant at Home Depot #6533 in North Richland Hills for almost a full year on the design of our tiny kitchen (our entire house is only 1550 sqft, the kitchen is not big), just to make sure no detail was left uncovered. We decided, to try to save a little money, we wouldn’t even change the layout or “footprint” of our original kitchen, no water lines moved, no electrical moved, etc. Just new cabinets, countertops, and appliances. Everything, including the installation, was purchased through Home Depot. The total cost coming to approximately $27,000 for everything. We were told multiple times that Home Depot would take care of everything and our kitchen would “look like it should be in a magazine” when it was done. Any damage to walls or anything while demo and install were taking place, Home Depot would patch and paint to match our existing. We didn’t order new flooring, because the kitchen was already costing so much!We paid for everything up front (a mistake apparently) at the beginning of July 2019. Our old kitchen was demo’d on 7/26/19, and we were promised that everything should be done by August 9th. Again, the kitchen is small, and since we weren’t changing any flooring or lighting or the layout, we had no reason to think it wouldn’t be completed when we were promised. We planned a family reunion at our house for 8/17 for 25 of our family members. Needless to say, it has been a nightmare since the Home Depot contractors demo’d our kitchen. Problem after problem, and none of them our fault. We are now three months in and our kitchen is still not done. Despite almost a year of meeting and prepping, the lower cabinets that were ordered were the wrong size (again, it’s a small kitchen, there’s not very many cabinets). Our cabinet brackets are loose, so some of the cabinet doors overlap when you try to close them, one of the cabinets is cracked and they installed it anyway, our lower cabinets were installed crooked, we have a recessed wall for our refrigerator, and the wall has holes behind it (like i can see our garage!) Our actual walls look awful, they are dinged and scraped and where they demo’d our old cabinets, they basically just slapped some white paint up there to try to cover it (our kitchen walls are not white, it looks awful). We have several items that have been sitting in our garage for months that still need to be installed, etc. We have no water, no working sink, no working dishwasher. For three months. We had no working oven, until my husband finally just installed it himself, even though we paid for Home Depot to install. My husband also installed our new refrigerator, which Home Depot was supposed to do, after it sat for weeks in our garage. We have no water, so once we were finally able to do a little cooking, thanks to my husband installing our oven, we have to wash our dishes in our backyard with a water hose, or in my CHILDREN’S BATHTUB!I’ve only listed a few of the big problems here, there are way too many little problems to list. Home Depot is not responding to us, or they keep putting us off. Someone was supposed to come today to do some work, but, as usual, my husband got another text today saying they can’t come. I have sent EIGHT emails to Pam Taylor in the past week, and she will not reply to me. I have confirmed her email address and that she does still work there, and she told one of the HD contractors that she is receiving my emails, she just is not responding. My husband calls and emails with little to no response.Needless to say, we are devastated. We had to cancel our family reunion, we have gone WAY over budget, we have spent almost $30K, this is a year-long process, we’ve had no kitchen for almost 3 months. We couldn’t cook for two of those months, at least we can use an oven now, thanks to my husband. My husband and I have 3 children. Having 3 hungry kiddos, and no way to cook is not fun, and we can’t afford to eat out every day!! We saved for years for this. And not one person at Home Depot seems to care. We have been blown off time and time again. We are not rich people, lol. We had to work hard to save for this “once in a lifetime” kind of remodel, and it has been a nightmare.",0,1

The Home Depot,Don’t order from Home Depot!,"Ordered a garage door on June 30,2019 at Store 1241 Albany. They use a contractor called Clopay. On July 15th Clopay installer Nick contacted me to double check the measurements. After sending pictures he was still doubting the measurements. He did not come here to verify himself and I didn’t hear from them again. Gave them 4 weeks thinking it was a special order door. Called Home Depot to check the status of the door. I was told I had to contact Clopay. So called them and they didn’t even order the door. Nick states I’m not sure how I overlooked it. Mind you this was end of August now. Nick came out to measure the door. Door was not ordered until September 21. Mind you I am calling Clopay every two weeks at this point. In early October I was told by Sierra that my door was at the distribution center (Home Depot) and i should receive a call in a couple days. No call, so again I called them the following week. They referred me to Nick to set up the install date. This was October 10th. Date for install was October 21. That day Nick called and cancelled the install and rescheduled it for today October 22. I was definitely not happy. I decided to call Home Depot to complain, talked to Sherri said they are having trouble keeping up, busy season for them. Really not helping but said if they cancelled again to call her. Well I’m calling her cause today I get a call stating my door was not at distribution center, nothing he can do about it. It has been 4 months since I ordered my door and my garage door doesn’t shut. So it’s open to the weather, bugs and anyone who decides to steal. Lucky enough I live out in the country and know my neighbors. All I can say I hope Home Depot discontinues using the contract company. And definitely I will NEVER order anything or shop there from here on out.",0,1

That's when I decided to take it back to home depot for a return and buy another one that would meet my needs. Note that I had not opened the box, and I had only delivered it yesterday. Both employee and manager said they would not return my purchase becuase it was purchased online. I could not believe what they were saying. They claimed it was published on their website. I went to their website and found this.""DEFECTIVE OR DAMAGED MAJOR APPLIANCES – Before a customer accepts delivery, major appliance products (including refrigerators, washers, dryers, ranges, dishwashers, and some microwaves) should be inspected for defects or damage, and if any exists, customer should refuse delivery.

There is apparently no contact between the technicians and Home Depot, so they are unable to check where the truck is that supposed to deliver the dishwasher; and I am now back on hold with Home Depot, to try to find out where the dishwasher is. Once it's delivered, I guess it will just sit in a box in the living room of my condo, since I will then have to call Home Depot back again to try to reschedule technicians - who knows when that will be.

When the customer and I asked why we had to leave her register, she just snapped at us and closed her gate, but her ""I'm open light was still on. It appears that FB was way more important than serving her customers. Poor customer service on her part.

WHY reschedule because if I ask for morning again I won’t get what I requested so she said she’ll cancel my order!! All she kept telling me was “I understand mam” ummm no you don’t I specifically asked for a morning delivery because I had other commitments in the afternoon and she said it doesn’t work that way and there’s nothing she can do! I’m the customer YOU should be able to reschedule this for a morning delivery as requested! Customer is always right....if I didn’t have a prior commitment I wouldn’t have an issue however the afternoon does not work for me she wouldn’t budge and I explained that her customer service skills sucks and a little more empathy would be nice and to help the customer not tick them off!Needless to say my order is cancelled thanks to Holly, no delivery even rescheduled and I will NEVER GO TO HOME DEPOT again for anything...that’s complete BS that I couldn’t even be helped properly!

The Home Depot,"Damaged washer, uninstalled appliances, and incorrect orders","We had ordered a fridge and washer and dryer. So far not much has gone right. We ordered a stackable washer/dryer and had several talking points with the sales person about our plans to stack them. when they came they delivered them they said there wasn’t a ‘stack kit’ on the order so they couldn’t stack them. Obnoxious, but ok. Then they said the order only had them removing just the old washer, not the old dryer. Why would we only want one removed?? So now the dryer still sits in our kitchen waiting for the new order to retrieve it to be filled. On top of that, the side of the washer is completely dented and visibly damaged. Still working through that with them, but good lord. It looks like this thing was rolled off the truck. The fridge was another obnoxious issue where then guy kept telling me I needed a plumber bc the water line wouldn’t shut off because the cap was broken. I tried to explain to him that I can turn the line off and he can install the new line without issue. Mind you, I’m a fairly ignorant person when it comes to this type of thing, but he did not understand and left without hooking up the fridge. My husband got home from work that night and did it in about 10 minutes. These guys were either very ignorant in their job, or lazy.

The Home Depot,Bad Customer Service,I have shopped at home depot ever since they opened up in our area . I have never had any problem until today . I took back some some t1-11 siding boards I had bought for a customer I had forgotten to grab the receipt from her which usually isnt no big deal but all of a sudden they claim they dont do returns without a receipt or a home depot account . Drove back got the receipt took the wood back in again to a closer home depot to the customers house and low and behold they still refused to take it back claiming I have a block on my I'd so they give me a 1800 number to call that is suppose to handle there returns and issues with them being declined and they claimed the receipt was invalid and when I ask to be connected to a supervisor they absolutely refused to transfer me to one hung up on me a total of 4 times then blocked my number so when I call there refunds people all I get is a busy signal now . Finally after going to a 3rd home depot a lady was able to get me my refund and couldnt understand why there was such a hassle after I went back and got the receipt. I will never shop here again I will use menards or lowes from now on . My advice to anyone who reads this do not shop here lowes and menards both are about the same price and have a larger selection .,0,1

The Home Depot,do NOT buy their service plan!,"Here was our formal complaint:We are writing to express our extreme disappointment and dissatisfaction with your service protection plan.We purchased a 1200 dollar Samsung refrigerator and a 195 dollar service protection plan 3 years ago.This refrigerator has been leaking inside for months and I called about one month ago to try to get someone in to fix it. I spent hours on the phone trying to get someone to come to my house and was told I had to wait over 3 weeks. I contacted the service provider directly to explain the problem with the refrigerator and request they bring any needed parts to fix the refrigerator during their visit as we are going out of the country for 6 months and will be renting our house. It became immediately evident that this was a second rate service provider. I made an appointment regardless but requested that Home Depot find another service provider to come in sooner.Home Depot proceeded to cancel my original appointment without telling me and the only way I found this out is because I called the original service provider and they told me Home Depot cancelled it. That they did this without my consent or without a phone call to advice me is simply unacceptable.Now we are going out of the country and have no one to fix this leaking refrigerator.We called your service protection line and got a petty apology and were told all they could do was set up another appointment in 2 weeks time.Let me just say that frankly your protection service plan is a joke and from now on we will not be buying any appliances from Home Depot and will make a post on all social media outlets advising people who buy appliances from you to buy the service plans directly from the manufacturer and not from you.

NSD never once contacted us so we had to follow up each time. They missed the first deadline because they lost the order. Home Depot tried to work with us by giving us money back and refunding the shipping. Unfortunately after waiting another 2 weeks, NSD lost it again. NSD did nothing to expedite the order and Home Depot essentially said I'd have to just wait another 2 weeks and they couldn't do anything about it. They said they could probably compensate us but we'd have to receive the item first. At the end of the day, HomeDepot was of no help and then even tried to tell me I'd have to take some additional steps to cancel my order.

Behr Raw Hidewhich they stop making several years ago and left consumers to do the clean up with no support.I will never buy any paint products from Behr or HD. I spoke to several Home Depot managers with no support saying contact Behr. 1 star was more than I wanted to give. Behr does not care about all the consumers they screwed!,0,1
The Home Depot,Your call is very important to us !!,"I called a store in Windsor area, put on hold for ever, transferred to be put on hold again, then the phone finally rang, but did so for 30 rings then it hung itself up.

They just canceled my second installation appointment without even calling me. I called and they said they suggested I find a plumber to install it.I am very unhappy with my dealings with the 50th Street location in Lubbock, Texas.But I will say the salesperson was nice and knowledgeable, I just want follow througt!Follow-up.. I went in person and spoke to the store asst mgr. He found a solution for me and my dishwasher was installed. Too bad I had to go that high to get it done but he was very helpful!",0,3
The Home Depot,I will never buy appliances from Home…,I will never buy appliances from Home Depot ever again and I advise others not to. Their delivery service is abysmal. They did not come on the first scheduled day nor the 3 subsequent scheduled days. They were effusive in their promises but failed to act on those promises. Customer service is also not reliable. No one called to say that the delivery would not be made on all 4 occasions. This whole experience has convinced me to actually not shop at Home Depot for anything else. I canceled my order and will shop elsewhere.,0,1
The Home Depot,We bought a club cadet lawn mower and…Nightmare!!!!!,"We bought a club cadet lawn mower and spend way over 3k to have it the way we wanted. What we were told in the store is we don't have it here you have to order it online and they would ship it to us. we are like great we don't have to worry about getting home. So time comes to get it delivered the driver shoes up 6 hours late unloads the mower that's in a crate. He puts it in the garage not taking it out of the crate leaves it on 2 pallets. With no way for us to even get it off them in the crate. then it had to be built. They told us it would be built the mulcher would be on and delivered. Worst thing is the drop this mower blocking my daughters handicap excess to get in the house. So we call the local home depot hey fight with us to get the mower they way they said we would. So they come up take the build it test it. Then they said its all good. So I was like cool. but it shouldn't of been a fight. But there is more when I get home I noticed it wasn't build completely, so my wife calls back and says its not done they say well its only a couple of bolts. that's crazy and one was the right rear wheel and the safety bar. I know crazy right. And still no mulcher. So I told then come pick this up and they said sorry its yours already and if you don't like it its your problem. I run a BMW motorcycle shop in Palm Bay and I would never treat a customer like this yet alone a women and special needs child like they took advantage of her. I'm not a tool person I told the manager & she says what you cant turn a wrench, I was like what the hell! We aren't asking for more then we paid for just what we were told we would get! and what we bought is way different for what we got. there customer service really sucks because they don't care for the customer. No one even called us back or followed up anything. We are still waiting for them to come pick this up. I'm calling the credit card for home depot and putting a hold on this next!!!",0,1

The Home Depot,I recently purchased a Ryobi power tool…,I recently purchased a Ryobi power tool combo set from Home Depot in Springfield Mo. After a few days the battery charger quit working. I called the store and talked to the service desk to ask if I needed to bring in all of the set for an exchange or just the charger. I was told just the charger so I did and they exchanged it and everything was great. Fast forward a few days and the same thing happened. Took the charger in and it was exchanged again no problem. I am happy and had no trouble since until a couple days ago. Went to use the flashlight for the first time and it doesn’t work. Took it in to exchange and was told they only do exchanges with the whole kit because it voids the warranty otherwise. I told them I had exchanged the charger twice with no problem. Then I was told my warranty was void then. Hold on a second. I did what Home Depot’s employees told me to do but now I’m out a flashlight and a warranty. Never shopping there again. Menards and Lowe’s for me I guess,0,1
The Home Depot,Recently I was shopping around for…Replace Bathtub,"Recently I was shopping around for prices to install a new bath tub, just a bath tub and shower surround. I went to Home depot and I have been with Home Depot for years, I had carpet and flooring installed by them years ago, So the associate at Home Depot Plaistow, NH set up an appointment for the gentleman to come out. He came out and measured and looked and then started asking me color questions and so on, come to find out they don't even use home depot products that was the first what? My bathroom is very small, probably 12x7, Who ever has these people install their product in their home #1 has abundance of money #2 has no clue they are being ripped off #3 are totally insane. Sorry, he gave me an estimate opps sorry a quote of 10,000 and 11,500.00. that is no tile no sink no vanity no toilet, just the tub and their non porous shower surround, basically plastic. for that bath i am pretty sure I could have the whole bathroom torn out replaced and tiled to my liking for that kind of money, probably even made a bit bigger. I have down renovations before myself, hands on, replacing a bathtub including a soaking bath soaking depth of 12-15"" should not be more than $3,000 tops including the tub. if materials provided depending on the plumbing easy access (we had easy access, shouldn't be more then 1500.00 DO NOT PAY THIS KIND OF MONEY FOR A BATHROOM Call your local handyman. Homr Depot get rid of these guys, why would you use a company that doesn't use the products you sell?",0,1
The Home Depot,last time I shop there,"I purchased an appliance and paid for delivery. At first I was told 9/24 it would be delivered, then they changed it to 9/19, then finally to 9/17. Then I received a call the day before telling me there was a 4 hour window starting at 12pm. I made space inside my garage and arranged for someone to be there at 12. When the person showed up at 11:45, the item had already been dropped off and was sitting in my driveway and blocking the entrance to my garage. I called the logistics company and was told the window was ""a suggestion"" of time. I called Home Depot and they said they aren't responsible for how it was delivered. I'm so, so, so disappointed in the execution of this delivery and the service received afterwards. It put a horrible taste in my mouth regarding doing business with Home Depot in the future. At this point, even if I have to inconvenience myself or pay more, it will be worth it to avoid shopping here.",0,1
The Home Depot,Get your own! I have to go help the men,I went to American Fork Home Depot for some replacement fence boards. I saw the ones I need stacked on top of an unopened pallet. I went to find an associate to get them down for me. The young man saw what I needed but refused to just reach them for me. He told me to go find some pliers snip open the pallet get the ladder he pointed to and to get my own. Even though I only needed a few that were plainly just out of my reach. He then said he was to busy as he needed to go help two men ahead of me. I opted for more expensive ones that were opened and got them . I mentioned to an other adult male who had pointed out the young man and noted that he had told me to open the pallet and get on the ladder myself and get them. He thought this was really funny and busted out laughing. I guess it was funny In a pathetic bro love way.,0,1

The Home Depot,Kingman Depot customer service is lacking,Kingman Depot needs to look up what customer service means. I placed a large order almost 3500.00 2 weeks ago. I went around the store taking pictures of everything we needed them to deliver. Together Christina who was great put our order together. One of the items being a 2500 gal water tank. I received a call this afternoon which was our confirmed delivery date stating they can't deliver on my dirt road which is only 2 1/2 miles long and a very good dirt road. I drive my Kia sole to and from work everyday. I asked for a manager. I was told she would call me back on 10 minutes. I called her back in 35 minutes. So glad I was so important to her she could not even take the time to call me back. She simply stated her driver already got stuck this morning and did not want to attempt our delivery. Maybe they need to pay more and get an experienced driver.Number 1. Why wait till the last minute to call me. Number 2. They delivered a 2500 gal water tank to us the previous year. Number 3. They had my address when I placed the order. Why didn't they mention that than. Number 4. They had 2 weeks to figure it out if they needed to get a different driver. Number 5. They should only hire drivers who know how to drive. They did not have a problem charging me the delivery fee. A matter of fact I received my bill 2 days ago. Even before my so called confirmed delivery. I wonder how many people who don't live on dirt roads need 2500 gal water tanks. We are so dissatisfied with Kingman Depot. We are closing are account. This was a hugh waste of our time.,0,1
The Home Depot,A $50 waste of time,"A $50 waste of time. I was doing only one room and was told I had to buy over 60 sq ft of carpet more then anyone else I talked to. I was assigned carpet without my permission but was told I could pick out a different one. I was told I had to buy the extra because no matter what I chose it could only be layed down a specific direction other wise you might notice that it was laid down in a different direction, even if all of the threads went straight up and down and there was absolutely no pattern in the carpet. It would have cost me an extra $190 for carpet I had no use for. Pretty sure it should be up to me if I want to pay extra for something that is virtually undetectable. Make sure to you go over that deal with a fine tooth comb before agreeing to anything.",0,1

The Home Depot,Bubbah at Southgate store is wonderful,"I had a man named Bubbah (could be a nickname) at the Southgate Home Depot help me last week. All I could think about was how I could write a favorable review for him once I left. I am not sure this is the right outlet, but I want to let his manager know that I was so grateful to have such a wonderful, experienced, and knowledgeable man help me. I needed to have a lock rekeyed to my house key. When I called, the associate said if I bought the knob set from HD they could rekey it on the spot. I went in and found Bubbah in hardware. He helped me find the right knob set, explained to me why latches get messed up in Colorado Springs over time, and properly re-keyed the new knob set I was buying. I got it home and it works like a charm. Many thanks to Bubbah for making this experience a very pleasant one all around.",0,5
The Home Depot,My husband went to Home Depot on Spring…,"My husband went to Home Depot on Spring Cypress today and bought some tile. They told him to pull his truck up and they would bring out. He waited for almost half and hour before he went back in to ask about it. Turns out they lost the tile and couldn’t figure out where it went. He was up there for hours until the manager told him we could pick a different tile for same price, plus $100 off for the inconvenience. By that time, 6 hours later, I had gotten off work and went up there to help find a different tile. We could not find anything that we liked or that matched our current floors. After being there for so long we asked if we could pick up the same one we originally bought at different Home Depot location and they told me yes, but they could not compensate us for the troubles being that we weren’t buying from their store. I was willing to drive to another location to pick up the tile that we wanted , that we had already paid for and they couldn’t compensate me for our time and troubles. We had birthday dinner plans and they ruined that and wasted our whole day. We decided to just get our money back in which the worker just seemed relieved like it was our fault they messed up our order. Needless to say, we went to Lowe’s down the street and got nicer tile for a better price. I will never go to Home Depot again. They lost a good customer.",0,1

The Home Depot,Price Misrepresentation,"This place is a scam. They advise you to check for product availability online before visiting a local store. They want you to pay full price, but you are being overcharged because the store has decided to manipulate pricing into their favor by charging more than the advertised price per square foot. You contact Home Depot customer resolutions without any resolution being given. You are told “although pricing online says this will be the price at the store, the store may increase the price if they desire. It’s determined by products readily available and those that must be ordered.” The fact is, all products are ordered from a manufacturer and sold at Home Depot so what products does Home Depot make? To be told that pricing for an appliance and store may match, but pricing for flooring or any other products marketed online and by Home Depot advertisements do not have to be honored if there is a discrepancy is misrepresentation. When asked to speak with someone you’re told customer service does not allow you to speak with anyone else. They give a false sense of empathy, but they truly wish to offer no resolution or valid answer. Just make a wise consumer decision and do business with Lowe’s. They don’t use “bait and switch” tactics to lure customers.",0,1
The Home Depot,"Home Depot @ Pearl City, HAWAII","Review for Pearl City, Hawaii location. Received Very poor and rude Customer Service in the appliances department from a male who over talks you with information that was irrelevant to the questions I had then had the nerve to tell me sternly to, “listen carefully” to him. While addressing this behavior to his manager, he kept staring and giving me the “eye”. The manager was apologetic and offered a small discount to purchase 2 appliances we were interested in. Unfortunately both needed to be ordered and was scheduled for delivery in 1 month (30 days). 2 days before my scheduled date, the Whirlpool customer service calls to say that 1 appliance is delayed and will be available in 30 days! We waited an entire month and WHY call us 2 days before delivery to tell us it’ll take an extra entire month??? Home Depot should’ve known this and/or gave us fair warning a lot sooner than 2 days before expected!!! I’m now trying to get that 1 other appliance delivered as scheduled but HD says they need to check since the purchase of both items were on one order. POOR SERVICE, IGNORANT People that NEEDS to be TRAINED properly in providing customers with better service!!! Terrible experience with a national company!!!",0,1

I asked the guy in the aisle if he knew Toto toilets and had no idea what I talked about an barely spoke coherent English. I told him I’m not sure he’ll be able to direct me if he’s not even sure of the toilet or toilet design. He then told me that he’s not a plumber and he can just direct me to the parts I’m looking for(which is all I was asking for and he had no idea whatsoever). He then told me since he didn’t know the parts in his own department that I could hire an in store plumber(for hundreds he said) to tell me what to do... I guess I needed to start with I AM A PLUMBER! I simply was looking for a part in his department and since he knows nothing about plumbing whatsoever he wanted me to pay another plumber hundreds of dollars to do his job... point me to the specific part in the aisle. If the simpletons in the aisle can’t speak English or know anything about the parts or stock they carry, I’m not sure what the point of having them there is...Home depot should genuinely hire half as many people and just hire more competent people and pay them better, having 6 confused workers who know nothing isn’t better than 2-3 knowledgeable workers.",0,1
The Home Depot,I bought a twenty two thousand vinyl…,"I bought a twenty two thousand dollar vinyl fence from Home Depot and had their contracting company install it . they said that this is the best fence that they sell, the contracting company Activeyards out of Columbus Georgia installed it, Mr Henderson said that this fence would sustain hurricane winds up to 140 mph. we had a hurricane with winds of 85 mph It blew my eight foot fence down and across the neighborhood, i took pictures of where the installers modified the post by cutting off the bottom of them so that they would not have too dig very deep. I showed them to the owner of the company and also Home Depot . they would not even come to my house and see what had happen.So i urged everyone that i can to Never do business with Home Depot and expressively with Mr Henderson at ""Activeyards company"" because they have a good sales pitch but hire some of the shadiest people that take short cuts take your money and don't return your calls.",0,1

The Home Depot,I will never order from Home Depot again!,"If your planning on buying a washer and dryer from Home Depot let me stop you. I ordered a stackable washer and dryer online, easy enough. Well when they came to deliver it, they said they couldn’t give it to me because I did not purchase the stacking kit. So I refused the order and called customer service. The agent told me that it comes with a stacking kit and they should have had it with them. She scheduled me for the next week with a stacking kit. So, I wait around for 4 hours waiting for my delivery. When it’s past the delivery time I call and after sitting on hold for quite awhile they told me that they had issues with the Home Depot local store and they wouldn’t be able to deliver. I immediately canceled the order. But, when you want a refund you have to call a specific number which took me 20 minutes on hold to find that out. Finally got my refund. I will NEVER order anything from this company again. I am a share holder as well and will be selling my stock. This company SUCKS!",0,1

The Home Depot,Can one give a ZERO star?,"Can one give a ZERO star? DO NOT BUY APPLIANCES from Home Depot. They do NOT care about their customers! Earlier this year I went into a HD store in Lilburn, GA and after a lengthy discussion with one of their sales people about my desire to switch from an electric cook top to gas and asked their advice about what would be the best choice for me, I followed his recommendation, and I agreed to purchase a cook top there. I immediately paid for the appliance AND for insurance. Upon delivery, a month later, I was told by the delivery men, that they just delivered, they did not install. I was also changing my countertop, and had those installers come out early, the morning of the delivery. Since the cook top was there, they took removed the old, and put in the new cook top so as to ensure the fit. I then called HD to find out when the installers would be coming. It was then that I was informed that I had not paid for installation, even though we had discussed it at the time of sale, and I had been told the ""total cost"" and made the final payment there and then. I I immediately went to HD and paid. This was a Wednesday. The installers were supposed to call me. I got an automated call late on SATURDAY night stating that someone would be there on Monday between 8 am and 8 pm. Can you imagine? Another day off work. At 9:00 PM on Monday no one had come. I called the installers' office to ask why. Oh, he could not make it to my home that day, but would come on Tuesday. I told them that I would be at work. After two plus weeks without a stove, the same guy who had come in April, to do the specs, came to do the installation. What did he tell me? I did not have an electrical outlet INSIDE the island. No one had told me about needing an oulet! I called the store manager, who informed me that HD did not provide that. Next BIG thing was that my Downdraft was cylindrical, while the new stove had a rectangular downdraft. He taped that thing up so that it looked as if I had done it myself. I wrote to Home Depot, AND I sent pictures of the DANGEROUS hookup. I never heard a word from them. This is August.; They DO NOT CARE. They got my money. Service is NOT important! As a Realtor, I will tell ALL my clients not to support Home Depot in any way. Service is non existent!",1,1

The Home Depot,Home depot delivery Bad customer experience,I have just had a very bad customer experience from Patricia from the Home depot shop in Woodbridge. Patricia’s outride rude tone and nothing you can or we can do about it manner was totally shocking. She informed me that they had called a left a voice message of the woodbridge shop inability to make a delivery because there had been an internal mix up between them and the Fredricksburg shop and that the delivery will now be delivered 48 hours later. No apology was offered and basically blaming me for not returning her call as she had requested on the voice message which I listened to after i had spoken with her. I had paid $89 for delivery on August 8 and now I am told the delivery will arrive August 10. Meanwhile I have arranged for a workman to start work on August 10.

The Home Depot,Who cares about Customer Loyalty?,"So I have owned an HD credit card for many years (probably close to 10). I have ALWAYS used the promotional no interest plans and always paid them off in full prior to expiration. This year has been tough as my mom passed away and now my dog has cancer. No excuse I know because we all have troubles, but I completely forgot to pay off my promotional plan in time. I got hit with $4400 in interest. I called HD to see if they could help me out as this was my first time but they said ""nope"". I immediately paid off the card ($16K) and have decided to NEVER shop there again or use the card. See we flip houses and buy a lot of materials so good news for Lowes. I know it was my fault and I signed up for this, but I just thought that maybe due to my longevity as a customer they could reduce the interest by something. Just be careful because in the end, they want you to forget to pay!! Good luck Home Depot - I am certain you will be just fine without my business.",0,1

The Home Depot,Store located at 35050 N,"Store located at 35050 N. North Valley Parkway, Phoenix Az 85086.The professional, Kind, Knowledgeable, go out of there way Employees I am writing about are:Shawn C.JavierValerieTessaOn 08-05-2019 at 8:30 PM My husband and I were looking for 16 boxes of Gray Planking. The store showed it had 18 boxes. We went right to the place where they stor them. ( we know this because we have bought this item about a year ago for our first retail store we were opening.) We only saw 1 box there. We ask a new employee for direction and he sent us to flooring, that is where we met Valerie. She greeted us with a smile and said I dont think its in Flooring. She begun to look and asked us to go with her back to where we were. She worked very hard for us and could not find the other boxes that we desperately needed for our grand opening August 27th, 2019. She went and asked for some help. We were then greeted by Shawn C. with a professionalism out of this world. He went out of his way to look. Thinking at this time Valerie went on back to her dept, I turned and she was walking back up to us with a gentleman Javier. I have never seen 3 professionals scan every where for the product from in the store to looking at the website. MIND YOU they really did not know how important our need for the planking was. They just had a natural urge to help. They came up with an idea pretty fast about looking at the website and calling other stores for us. We all walked up to the front counter. All the employees were getting ready to have a meeting around the counter. I truely believe everyone said hello while Shawn, Javier and Valerie were still working together locating our planking. At this time Valerie dropped off and went over to the meeting. Javier and Shawn started talking with Tessa about what we needed. All 3 of them were working with us. To end this experience. David and I were so pleased to be so lucky that your employees were there for us. They ordered our planking from the Peoria store made arrangements for us to pick it up the next day and my husband will start building our display tables for our 2nd retail store we are opening. I just want them to know we appreciated them very much.Thank you Leslie/David",0,5
The Home Depot,Go to my local home depot as I do…,Go to my local home depot as I do around 5 days a week being a contractor. First off no carts in the store so back outside I go to shag a cart head back inside to drywall section and load up 20 boxes of drywall mud and 4 rolls of tape I then push my cart and park it at the end of the isle to then head to the paint section for roll of floor paper and tape away from cart maybe 5min come back only to find cart gone. Talk to the lady at pro check out who then stoo 2 other guys who say we put it back so rather then apologize they walk away I head back outside for another damn cart get back to the mud only to see I was lied to because there were only 4 of the 20 boxes I previously loaded back on the shelf so once again I load 20 more. As a contractor time is money and the last thing i needed was practice loading mud onto a cart. Absolutely worst customer service I've received in years and has permanently put a bad taste in my mouth. I've spent around 200000 bucks there in the last 2 or 3 years and will definitely be looking to give my business to a competitor.JTS DRYWALL,0,1
The Home Depot,Poor consumer service and delivery service,Cancelled my online washing machine order after the delivery never came and no one even called.

Where's the consumer service. Had me waiting for a 4 hour interval for this... I cancelled the entire order and asked for a refund. Was told I'd see it 3-7 business days. So I ordered with Lowe's and got my washer installed the next day. On a Sunday morning. Awesome delivery team went over and above. Two weeks later I look on my credit card acct. to see Home Depot still hadn't refunded me for the washer I bought from them and cancelled. Smh. Called consumer service again . Turns out they don't know why they only refunded me $20 for the installation. Ridiculous. Lowe's over Home Depot for good.,0,1

The Home Depot,Tuff Shed purchase,"Purchased a 'Tuff Shed' from the local Home Depot at Mt. Moriah Road in Durham, NC. Handled the design and purchase online and by phone with a Tuff Shed Customer Service Manager, on 7/29/19. Total cost of the purchase was approximately $3,700 which included North Carolina tax. At the close of the discussion he told me (Ricky ** from Tuff Shed) that the entire purchase price would be charged to my credit card at that time and installation would be approximately 6 weeks from date of purchase. I asked why the entire amount and he said because Home Depot 'wants their money' upfront. I asked why there wasn't a deposit requirement with balance due prior to installation and he said because Home Depot required their money before anything was built.I was given the name of the Home Depot Manager at the Mt. Moriah road store in Durham, Mr. Jonathan **. I called him and He told me there is nothing that he could do and continued to tell me that customers making major purchases would be required to pay the entire purchase value AT time of purchase. Not a deposit or pay as services are provided, rather...the entire amount at time of contract/agreement/purchase. It is simply hard to believe that someone can purchase/order a new car for thousands of dollars, provide credit approval at time of order and not have to pay the total cost of the vehicle until the vehicle is delivered and customer takes possession and the bank forwards the funds to the dealership.Home Depot, clearly, doesn't have the customer in mind, rather, 'get the cash and to hell with the customer'. Think, if you are in the market for a similar purchase, several thousand dollars, either find a vendor who will accept a deposit with balance paid at delivery or look for a different supplier/vendor. Home Depot is interested only in their profits. Good luck.",0,2
The Home Depot,Pure garbage,"I head a heavy warning to anyone buying appliances from Home Depot, I bought a dish washer, was told I can’t pick it up has to delivered (60$ fee). Was given a 4 day later 12pm-4pm window. Took a half day off work. (Loss of $175 in wages , now the delivery fee is $235). Get a Automated message (4:20pm, 20min after Scheduled time) stating they would be there within an hour. Called the delivery company and expressed that I had my four-year-old daughter swimming and would not be there, they informed me they would call have the diver call a half hour before they arrive. Got a phone call from the driver 6:15pm (6hrs have been waiting) from the driver saying their at my house, I told him “I spoke with dispatch, I’ll be there in 10-15min”.....and he says, “I can’t wait i got delivery’s you need to reschedule“ .....so I get home call Home Depot appliances. They say there’s nothing they can do. So I rescheduled, for the following Saturday.......they can’t give me a time frame, the delivery company will contact you the day before between 4-8pm with time frame, still no phone . (Now a full week), I call Home Depot again, and am on hold for another 30-40 min......with “I’m sorry Sir we can’t get through to our delivery company, nothing we can do”, I ask for a direct phone number to them?!?!? , “sorry Sir you’ll have to google them”.......this is absolutely absurd, a multi-million company they uses a delivery company for thousands of delivery’s a day, can give me a contact number!!!, this is the worst service I have ever received, if you want a company that cares next to nothing about you, and could not care about your households disruption and only cares about your money, they make sure you order from HOME DEPOT.

The Home Depot,When you order multiple appliances,"When you order multiple appliances, understand that your delivery date is, at best, etched in dust. If there's a single item on back order, you won't receive a thing until it's all available. Don't bother complaining, as the most management will do is shrug, apologize, and blame the policies of the delivery service they hire. Unfortunately, hollow apologies don't serve the customer, and gone are the days when one takes responsibility for the actions of the people in their hire. Calling their delivery service won't help either, as they send you through an automated maze with precious little human contact to be had.We ordered four appliances from The Woodlands store (#6516) back in June (an LG fridge and an oven, microwave, and dishwasher from GE). We set the delivery date for August 2, during our vacation time. Just last week we were told that two of the GE items are on back order and that the anticipated delivery date has been arbitrarily pushed back to August 13. Then we were informed that we won't even see our LG fridge until the GE items get sorted out. The fact that our fridge is collecting dust at the Dupar warehouse just 23 miles away is immaterial. (Yes, that was the one piece of valuable information I could extract from Corporate Customer Service.)The only other information I got from Corporate Customer Service was why a $108 billion company couldn't intervene on their customers' behalf. The agent said, ""We cant tell a third party company what to do."" Obviously, money talks only when it wants to.We finally did reach the delivery service, and we asked why they couldn't at least deliver our fridge on the date we'd established. The delivery representative told us (and I quote) ""it wouldn't be convenient to make two deliveries."" You read that right: their company's convenience trumps their customer's convenience. Today I called the GE customer support line. They gave me a new delivery service number. I called it, and was immediately forwarded to (you guessed it) the automated Home Depot delivery service.The managers at Home Depot 6516 can blame everyone they want to, but they can't change the fact that their store itself will forever be the face of this fiasco. Home Depot chose to associate with this delivery service, but then they shirked their responsibilities when that delivery service failed. Any business that truly cares for its customers will have a Plan B when Plan A fails. Home Depot's Plan B is for my family to eat off of a hot plate or break the bank dining out until someone in their ranks finds the gumption to hold up their end of the deal.So if you're considering Home Depot for your kitchen appliances needs, just repeat the mantra: ""Company convenience trumps the customer's convenience. Company convenience trumps customer convenience.""Robert Kissner",0,1

There is NO WAY they actually came up to the door and knocked or rang the bell. It took 50 minutes on hold to get through to a human. After waiting on hold again for almost 30 minutes, while he tried to contact the delivery company, I was told, they were at the house as they took a picture of it, and it would be 10 DAYS before they could re attempt delivery. Again, there is NO WAY they actually came up to the door and knocked. I wasted almost 1 1/2 hours on hold I told the customer service rep to cancel the order and refund my money. He advised the refund could take up to 5 business days. Of course it would, they are not in a hurry to give money back. Well it has been almost a month and still no refund. Home depot is not helping to resolve the situation, they have my money and will not issue the refund.

The Home Depot,Beware of HD services,"Beware of HD services. First, delivery of wood flooring: Day 1, no delivery. Day 2, no delivery. Day 3, partial load. Day 4, weeks after day 1: final load.Second: Installation: A subcontractor from the Alhambra CA HD measured my home for the flooring. I told him I’d remove the molding around the rooms because I wanted to reuse it. It was original and I wanted to keep the same look.Another subcontractor wrote up the order with a huge mistake. Instead of entering that I would remove the molding, they entered that I would remove the entire existing wood floor below my carpet. I didn’t notice their mistake because it was buried in a tiny column of an Excel file in a large pile of papers I received. This subcontractor also entered that I had furniture in the hallway, which I did not. When the installer arrived, he told me he couldn’t install the new flooring over my existing floor, and that it would cost me $2,000 to tear out. He was going to remove the carpet. How was I supposed to remove the flooring underneath first? HD says that my existing floor was unforeseen, but there was a large hole in the carpet in the hallway and anyone could have seen the floor below if they’d looked. The only person who came to my house was the subcontractor who did the measurements and he didn’t look. I wouldn’t have started this project if I’d known it was going to cost me $2000 more and now I’m stuck with a house full of boxes of flooring. Their subcontractor caused this disaster and they refused to give me a dollar in compensation. I trusted them. Not anymore.",0,1
The Home Depot,The Home Depot Card is the biggest scam…,"The Home Depot Card is the biggest scam ever. Three years ago I tried to ring out and I did not have enough funds on the card, so I called in to up my credit limit for a purchase and they said no problem, we will do that for you...... Not the case. After three years of not checking my credit score that was great. I checked my credit score yesterday, and my dings came from the Home Depot card. Instead of raising my credit limit like I asked, they just allowed me to go over the limit by $1500.00. So this has had a very negative affect on my credit score. I have called and they will do nothing to help me fix it. They say that the card has a built in over credit allowance and there is nothing they can do to help me, and no help at all!!! After paying high interest with over a 700 credit score, they do not want to help as their card has dropped me to a 620 after three years of being over the limit. I cancelled my card and asked for a limit at the same amount of my debt to help with the score and they denied me..... I asked them to note the credit report saying they granted me to go over, they would not do that as well. This is after three years of on time payments plus some.... Never again will I spend money with their card or at their store!!!! Which is to bad for them as I am a contractor... LOL! P.S: Do not get their card if you want to be treated like a real human with worth!! Get one some where that actually wants your future business with a lesser rate!!",0,1
The Home Depot,Online gift card purchase gone bizarre.,"Last night my wife went online to purchase a gift card, using our Home Depot credit card. Other cards were allowed, but not Home Depot's own card. Using a third party negates a more personable approach. I took time this morning to go into a local Home Depot where Julie, at Customer Service, was as surprised as I was that we couldn't use our Home Depot card. Bizarre. I commend Julie's cheerful, helpful attitude in purchasing a physical gift card. Without her appreciated assistance this would be a 1 rating.In addition to the inconvenience of having to buy a physical gift card, we now have to pay postage. Our online experience was disappointing. If Macy's allows me to purchase an online gift card I doubt they would forbid the use of their own card to make the purchase. No, they would encourage using a Macy's card since it's money in their bank, whether the gift card is fully used of not.This isn't the Home Depot I once knew.

The Home Depot,I purchased a new Whirlpool (Model…,"I purchased a new Whirlpool (Model wdta50sahz) dishwasher on July 9, 2019 and had it installed shortly after, only to find the appliance does not work the way it should. I tried calling them on Saturday July 27, 2019. First, Cass put me on hold for 14 minutes never to return to the call (so I hung up), I called again and spoke to Patricia. She was kind and scheduled a technician to come out Monday July 29 and said I would get a confirmation call with a delivery time the night before. This never happened!!! So today is Monday July 29 (day of scheduled delivery) and I call customer service (spoke to Michelle) and Michelle informed me ... ""I am not scheduled in the system"". What!? ""Sir, someone from the office will call you back with a new date."" What!? Her reason with the scheduling mistake ... ""because you called on Saturday"". Hahaha. Unbelievable! No ownership on Home Depot's part. It's because I called on a Saturday. Are you kidding me? It's very very frustrating to go through such loops. I've been duped and sold a lemon and getting someone scheduled just to take a look at a brand new out-of-the-box unit is proving to be frustrating. This is crazy! As a consumer, it feels like there's no recourse for being sold bad product and Home Depot just sits back and waits for calls to come in. Based on others' reviews, Home Depot makes excuse after excuse. Can some oversight organization please look into these business practices!? In addition, I would LOVE to know the percentage of bad product sold to unsuspecting consumers ... and then how much money is made sending technicians to ""assess"" the problem. Home Depot, you are starting to sound like a shady car dealership.",0,1

The Home Depot,Rude and just don’t care,I order an appliance package from them and schedule the delivery to be done two weeks later. They set a delivery time between 2 and 6 . Well I call them at 5:30 and said that my delivery was still not here. They said it was on the truck and on the way. I check tracking again 5 minutes to 6 and the delivery date was changed to two day later when I was at work. I sold all of my old appliances and had no appliances thinking my new ones where going to be delivered. I call the manger of the store and he said there is nothing I can do that the delivery company will be contacting you. And I ask him why was the delivery date changed and he said I don’t know why. He was rude and just didn’t care. They don’t even have there on delivery people like Lowe’s does. So I highly recommend you not to use them. If they show a cheaper price just take it to Lowe’s and they will beat it and delivery your stuff the next day . I will never shop at Home Depot again..,0,1
The Home Depot,Incompetent employees,"We are in the midst of a kitchen remodel. When we first went in and sat with the kitchen designer, she put in the cabinet & apliance order. She ""accidentally"" charged our Visa card nearly $8,000 instead of our Home Depot card!She then had to cancel the entire order and start over. I spent 5 hours there!!!!They also over estimated sq ft for our countertop. We had decided on qartz with a chiseled edge. When Precision Countertops sent out the guy to do the template he came to 12 sq ft less. He also advised us that a chiseled edge was not available in quartz due to it being a glass product and would break. So, we had to completely change the order to granite in order to get the edge we wanted...Lo and behold, when I went in to see the kitchen designer AGAIN the granit was on a ""promo"" price and $15 per sq ft less than the quartz. Hopefully there won't be an issue this time..it set us back 3 weeks..We also had to order 2 more upper kitchen cabinets. Ordered them on June 27th. Was told they would be here July 24, then got notice they would not be here until Aug 2nd! Nothing special, just off shelf type cabinets.Got notice they were here today and called to let them know we would be at the store @ 11 a.m. We arrived on time and they still hadn't brought them out for pickup. 45 minutes later they finally brought them to the front of the store. Meanwhile as I was waiting I observed several employees mindlessly ambling around doing nothing.I will never do business there again if we ever do any more remodel!!!!",0,1
The Home Depot,I purchased a granite countertop from…,"I purchased a granite countertop from Home Depot (June 2018) to be cut and installed by Stoneworx. The price was average and quality of the countertop itself is solid however the overall experience has been very disappointing. The installation required no fewer than 7 visits (miss-measuring, forgotten pieces, re-work and overall poor organization) and resulted in damage to my wall (door trim) and dishwasher). Material issues included sizing incorrect, overhangs inconsistent, edges not lining up with backsplash/walls, and very visible seams. Customer service at both the store level and CustomerCare Canada were quite lacking (weeks/months between returning communications, requesting the same photos 5+ times, refusing to send a Home Depot representative out to inspect the issues, and refusing to provide contact information for the next level of support/supervision).Customer Service gets a 1 out of 10 for this experience.

The Home Depot,Worst company I have ever encountered,"Home Depot is the absolute WORST COMPANY my husband and I have EVER wasted our money on. They continuously for approximately three months had us running around in circles jumping through hoops to get measurements for our floors to be done with laminate. They had to have someone come out to our house three times because they provided us with wrong measurement information and after all said and done, they gave us a total of 8.5k to have our floors done. Once we paid for everything, we expected to have our floors done while I was in the hospital delivering my son and they called us to tell us they couldn’t do our floors because hey were missing 540 sq feet. When we called Home Depot to try and get this resolved, they told us we had to pay another 4K. And that there wasn’t anything they could do for us when THEIR WORKERS were the one that gave us a wrong total AND PROVIDED US WITH THE WRONG AMOUNT OF SUPPLIES FOR OUR FLOORS TO BE DONE. They wouldn’t offer a discount or take their supplies back for a full return and then had the audacity to tell us there was a glitch in their system after we scheduled for a return. So we told them no because we felt they were trying to screw us out of money AGAIN. This is so ridiculous and it pisses me off that this was all their fault and they didn’t try to fix anything and continue to have us jump through hoops and I feel like they did this on purpose to screw us out of money. I will never ever ever give Home Depot the time of day or money Again and I will be sure all of my loved ones stop giving them their business as well. P.s: they didn’t even tell us that it was going to cost extra to rip up our floors on top of the cost that we already paid. Then kept cancelling on us or giving us wrong dates of when we can have the floors done or have people come out to measure. Idk how a company can be so unorganized and inaccurate.",0,1

I am yet again having issues with my dryer. I have been calling since Monday...this is Thursday and they have only just now started a claim and I've been told I will have to wait two MORE days for them to call me back!! They were trying to tell me at first that I didn't purchase the extended warranty.

The Home Depot,Worst customer experience ever!!!,"Worst customer experience ever!!!! One-star is over-rated for the Home Depot Delivery Service or their Customer Support Service (phone call team). The stackable washer we ordered online has involved with: three times of credit card charges, multiple forced rescheduled and delayed deliveries (they never tell you when something went wrong, or delayed, until you made the call again), numerous phone calls to chase after our order (oh and when they finally came, they never call you 30 min before the delivery as promised on their website), and finally, we were told we have to remove and reinstall our dryer on top of the washer by ourselves - they didn't even care to tell us that in advance until the delivery man came! They don't provide the service, and the only thing they can do it to ""reschedule"" our delivery, installation, and haul-away service another time week later. All these experience has shown: 1, They Truly did NOT care about their customer's needs. Totally no respect for their customers' time. 2, Their internal communication sucks, either within the customer service team or between it and the delivery team. 3, They don't know how to do supply-chain management or time-management. 4.

The Home Depot,STAY AWAY from Home depot Period.,"STAY AWAY from Home depot Period. I will Never EVER buy ANYTHING from them AGAIN. I went into the store in Pensacola Florida on July 14,2019 to purchase a GE side by side refrigerator. When my wife and I went into the Appliance dept. we began looking at refrigerators to get an idea of what models they had during which, (the sales person was overheard discussing his marital relationship with his male partner with a coworker) We were basically being ignored until I asked for assistance about several refrigerators that were out on the floor marked as on Clearance. Their conversation ended when a manager had walked up and began discussing some work related sales events coming up and who they should be securing or displaying items. The sales person (male) don't remember his name, walked down the isle with my wife and I, and basically informed us that any of the clearance models would require us to transport them and that they were as is with no warranty. After this information my wife and I decided to continue looking at the non=clearance refrigerators. The sales person completely walked away and left us. No, hey if you have any questions or need any further assistance just let me know or anything....He just simply disappeared. So we both decided on which refrigerator we wanted to purchase, and as we were looking for the salesman, another customer came up looking for the salesman as well. He asked me,""do they even have anyone working here today""? I told him, ""yes"" but I didn't know where they went. As we were looking down the main isle, another department member was walking by and asked if she could help us. We told her what were wanted to purchase and she notice the salesman down at the opposite end of the isle. She said she would go and get him.Salesman returns, My wife and I began to tell him what we would like to purchase, and He immediately turns to the other customer and asked, ""So how can I help you"", in which the customer replied,""I just wanted to reschedule a delivery"". The salesman then informs the customer, ""I can't do that from here,you will need to call them or do it online"". (We are still waiting) basically being blown off....The Salesman then, changes his response to the other customer and says, ""No wait I can change that, it will just take a few minutes""(no hey can you guys wait just a second while I take care of this or anything) Salesman works on the other customers delivery. Then finally...Salesman says, So which one do you want to buy, we escort him to the model and tell him we would like to purchase the one in Black (which had a different model number). Salesman goes back to register with my wife, processed to ring up refrigerator as I continued to compare prices. Wife comes back with papers and receipt which Clearly is the WRONG ITEM and IS WAY OVER the PRICE we had told him we were purchasing. I took the Receipt back to him and told him It was wrong. His response was, ""well I guess I need to change it then""...The purchase was corrected,we requested delivery..On 7/18/19 the unit is to be delivered. According to the contract (Customer Delivery check list.. top of page,right side, second item it states:YOU will be Contacted via automated voice system after 2 pm the DAY BEFORE your requested delivery to inform you of your projected 4 hour delivery window.....(WHICH WE NEVER RECEIVED)...day of delivery..(I had to look online and check the time of delivery)(there was no prior offer or option as to a delivery time to pick or suggest at the time of purchase).After discovering the delivery time was between 4p and 8p the morning of the scheduled delivery I called the local store where the purchase was made. I requested an earlier delivery and was informed that I would have to call 850-484-0710 or 850-477-3718 and see if they would do anything. I was informed that the store does not do the delivery that it is done by another company (Something that was NOT disclosed at time of purchase)I called the number above, and spoke to a person and requested the delivery be brought earlier and was informed that the drivers were to far out and that they would not change the delivery time.

The Home Depot,My son ordered a washing machine for me…,"My son ordered a washing machine for me online, I received it 2 days ago. I was absolutely shocked when I opened it after they dropped it off. There are water stains on the steel tub and when I removed the cap that was covering the opening where you attach the drainage hose, smelly, musty water came pouring out. NO water stains or water should be in a brand new machine. I guess Home Depot thought they'd get away with this. My son called them and now I have to wait another week to get a replacement. It BETTER be a brand new one, this one was obviously used. As soon as I opened the lid there was a nasty musty smell, who knows how long that water was in there. This is the first time I've gotten one from Home Depot, I've always gotten them from Lowe's with NO problems. I am truly disappointed in Home Depot trying to pull this stunt. I know a used washer from a new one. Make sure you check any appliance or any type of machine thoroughly. I guess they thought whoever got the washer wouldn't notice. What a dirty thing to do to someone. Oh, and the machine was in a box as though it was brand new, pretty sneaky crap there Home Depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,Our delivery was scheduled for Monday…,"Our delivery was scheduled for Monday morning 9am-1pm. Received confirmation the evening before. The morning of, we received a call at 9:30am that our delivery was being delayed because the truck was broke down and it couldn't be rescheduled until Wednesday morning. I had checked and there were 7 deliveries ahead of us. Why did it take until 9:30am to tell us that the truck basically never showed up to the warehouse to pick up the deliveries. I know this because I was offered the ability to pick up the item. I would have picked it up except they refused to put it on my vehicle for me. I would have had help at home, but not at warehouse... I complained to them and Home Depot and got no where. Home Depot gave us a concession refund of $125 and promised the item would arrive on Wednesday and that we would be earlier on the schedule. That felt great and appropriate.Well, guess what, its Wednesday morning (today) and I get another call that the item can't be delivered because the truck is broke down. WOW! I'm starting to think that they need better trucks or need to rent a truck. Turns out that they just have contractors as truck drivers and they neither Home Depot or this company have control over it. What a joke and waste of time and money! Again, I had to take off work, rearrange my schedule again, because of the confirmation the evening before, only to have it cancelled again last minute. This is beyond frustrating.After going back and forth with Home Depot, and ForwardAir, I was given a $75 concesssion by ForwardAir and they promised my fridge would be delivered on Friday!!I have an infant and a 3 year old and a breast feeding wife and have now been without a fridge for 1.5 weeks and Friday will almost make it 2 weeks, if THEY EVEN SHOW UP!! Which is at this point is completely a joke! I'm starting to think that the whole ""the truck broke down gag"" is just a lie to appease customers. Whether the driver called in sick or didn't show up because it was too hot, or they were overbooked, I'm pretty sure that they just kicked me to the curb again.I have now taken off work twice and they want me to do it again on Friday and trust that they will show up! No thanks!! Instead I had a friend take off work, we rented a dolly from Uhaul and we went and picked up the dang thing ourselves. And they WOULDN'T EVEN HELP US LOAD IT IN THE TRUCK!! And when I called to have it set up for Will Call, the woman argued with me about it having been cancelled on Monday and today and said it was scheduled for friday. She was incredibly rude and told me that if it was cancelled, then I would have gotten my money back. It was completely uncalled for and unacceptable conduct. I just wish I would have gotten her name. I told her that semantics aside, it seems that they aren't able to deliver my fridge and I want to just pick it up myself.I feel like someone in upper management needs to know to be fixing this problem and that if Home Depot is trusting this company to deliver goods for them, then they are in a lot of trouble. There need to be contingencies in place for when something like this happens. A local store could have sent two guys and a truck and a dolly to pick it up, just like I had to do and it would save a lot of trouble. I promise, this is the LAST appliance that I will EVER purchase from Home Depot and everyone in my circle will know as well. After years of preferring Lowe's, I was actually warming up to home depot during this experience, prior to the delivery fiasco. I have lost at least 10 hours of work due to this, lost face with my boss, caused undue stress to my breastfeeding wife and myself, and more lost groceries, and more ice I had to purchase. I don't think I will ever trust you to successfully deliver something again. I hope this gets fixed in the long-term, for the sake of your business, but this was miserable. All of your Home Depot customer service people were very helpful and nice, but it was obvious that they really have no power to do anything to actually help me.",0,1

I already knew 1st installers screwed the hose because I have a friend who does this for living. But because i bought the fridge from homedepot, i wanted THEM to fix it. So i told the installer, i know the problem is with the hose, so they should take a look at it. Instead of looking into the hose, they just said its not their problem. One of the gentleman said they do this for living. I asked the gentleman what his name was, so i can call homedepot to replace the fridge like he told me to do, he literally screamed at me and left the house because i was keep asking for his name. I called customer service and they said they cant do anything to the 3rd party. So, My friend came and fixed the hose in 10min. Homedepot does not use professional installers.

The Home Depot,Terrible Service,"When you spend nearly $1000 on a dishwasher and professional installation at a nationally recognized store, ""Home Depot,"" you expect the ""white glove"" treatment–meaning they should take care delivery and installation of the product. Additionally, if there are any issues that arise during this process, they should promptly take care of it. Unfortunately, that is not the case. My experience in dealing with Home Depot and is services has been horrible. The installation crew hired to install the dishwasher were NOT professional installers. Specifically, the crew that came to my home was neither bonded or insured to performed the task. The crew was suppose to remove an old dishwasher and replace it with a new one. Removing and installing a new dishwasher should be a fairly simple task for any plumber or a handyman. However, the crew hired by Home Depot and sent to my home said because they didn't have the correct hose length they couldn't perform the installation. In fact, the crew explained that their company wouldn't allow them to install the dishwasher. However, I believe the real issue was they didn't have an electrical license nor the necessary plumbing hoses that would've accommodated any type of installation. I purchased the dishwasher and installation service through Home Depot online. When the installation debacle occurred, I called Home Depot, but was passed on to several different departments before getting to someone who could help to schedule another installation service. Yet again, Home Depot hired the same company to come back my home a week later. Needless to say, the crew gave me the same excuse of why installation couldn't happen. Yet again, I contacted the Home Depot. After spending nearly an hour on the phone with the Call Center. Finally, a local professional plumbing company was hired for the installation. However, once the company arrived to my home it was determined the new dishwasher had been damaged during delivery (broken hinges and damage to the tray). Beyond frustrated, I requested a new dishwasher; however, Home Depot wanted to send a third installer to see if he could repair the damage to the dishwasher. By then, I had run out of patience and requested my money be returned. Needless to say, this will be my last purchase from Home Depot.",0,1

Kept calling until I finally got a manager who said he was going to get to the bottom of it and give me a call back right away. He never called back. The worst customer service I have ever had. The most unknowledgeable people I’ve ever dealt with. I will NEVER buy an appliance from Home Depot again and suggest everyone stay away! I still don’t know when my mother will get her refrigerator and at this point am fighting to get my money back and cancel the order.",0,1

The Home Depot,My wife order a new storm door on June…,My wife order a new storm door on June 21 to be installed by home depot third party installers. Took them about 2 weeks to come out on July 1 to measure for the door. Never heard anything from them again. My wife stopped in on the July 8 to check on progress. She was told she would be called back today in morning. No call. We stopped in the store again. Measure were never upload to home depots system. Home depot did try to call the installer today and got no response. We cancel the order. Turns out the info was not in the installer system either. Beware of home depot third party installer.

The Home Depot,Home Depot doesn’t care about customers,"I purchased an LG washer and dryer 3 weeks ago from Home Depot (Cheektowaga NY) First delivery date the product was damaged so bad the delivery company refused to even come to my house. HUGE disappointment from Home Depot/LG, the products should be properly packaged for shipment to not get damaged during shipping. Home Depot didn’t even care and stated “this happens all the time” and scheduled a delivery on a day/time I couldn’t do. I took off work to have these delivered, and now had to go to a laundromat to have my laundry done. I’m out a good amount of money for taking off work to have these delivered, and now going to a laundromat. LG company was absolutely no help after a complaint to them. They couldn’t do anything until the final product was delivered. In attempt to call Home Depot and speak to a manager about my less than acceptable experience, I was on hold for 40 MINUTES, and was HUNG UP on THREE times. This is unacceptable customer service. These employees need to be fired, transferred to a non-customer service department, or completely 100% retrained. I gave up trying to call, it is obvious Home Depot doesn’t care about its paying customers. Finally got ahold of a manager named Dave on the phone, and I went in store to speak directly to him. He changed the second delivery day/time to something more suitable for my schedule. Perfect! Should have been delivered Saturday between the hours of 5:30pm and 9:30pm, with a courtesy call 30 minutes prior to delivery. I sat around all night waiting for my appliances. They were NEVER DELIVERED. Home Depot was phoned at 9:30pm in question to why, I was told by the manager I was #22 and they were finishing with job #20 and they will get to my house tonight. THEY NEVER SHOWED, no phone call, nothing!!! I will now have to go to the laundromat tomorrow and spend another $50 just for clean laundry. I have spent nearly $1700 on a new LG washer and dryer and this experience has been nothing but disappointing and aggravating. Upon another call to Home Depot they offered no help either as they are not in control of deliveries. Now I will have to wait another week to get my appliances. This experience alone makes me hesitant to shop at Home Depot for anything in the future, big or small. Very disappointed in how everyone handled this situation, as it seems Home Depot doesn’t care about its customers. I will requesting a full refund plus an additional $350 for the money I have lost taking off work to receive these appliances and having to go to a laundromat in these last few weeks. I would caution anyone buying a large appliance at Home Depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,Had to call police because of HD employee behaviour,"So this has never happened to me before, and hopefully never again will... I booked an appointment for duct cleaning. Made sure the price is clear with no hidden charges (flat fee for 10 ducts or less). Guy comes, has a bit of an attitude, then wants to charge me for 15 'vents' (again, I had explicitly made sure we're talking 'ducts' not 'vents' when we set up the appointment). Told him I wouldn't pay the extra, only the agreed on price.Guy starts going off on a tangent, tells me how forthcoming he was because he cleaned the filter on my dryer also and threatens me and my family (in front of my two children) that he would not leave our home until we paid.Told him we would have no choice but to call the police if he wouldn't leave, but that I was happy to pay the agreed to amount. Well, never thought this would happen, had to call the police (who came) before he left. Wasted tax payer money, made my family feel threatened and unsafe IN OUR OWN HOME. Unbelievable... don't by services from Home Depot is all I can say.",0,1
The Home Depot,Horrific experience with this store's…,"Horrific experience with this store's flooring delivery and pickup subcontractors. We were charged $2,000 and promised a flooring installation. All of the materials were dropped off by HD's flooring delivery subcontractors. Two weeks later, they were supposed to install the floor. This is after the measure and everything. The guy shows up and says he can't do the job because ""the floor is not level."" Now, they are holding our $2,000 because they can't figure out how to get someone over here and pick up our materials. The first time someone scheduled a pickup, we waited all day - 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. - and no one showed up. The second time, the guy waited less than 15 minutes because I was outside taking my dog out in the morning and left. Also, they wanted to charge us an additional $79 to come and pick up the materials - even though obviously that is not our responsibility. I hate this store. I will never even buy a paper towel roll from this store again and will highly discourage anyone I know from shopping here.",0,1

The lack of availability for customer help is apparent at plumbing, Customer service, door area, and Wood Mill area is very visible. There is no employee buy in to provide help for the services offered within the company. Also, very apparent is the lack of training and technical knowledge in the Home Depot employee culture maybe that is why they employees hide from customers. I have being try to purchase a door for the last two weeks and the measurement stage has been delayed because according two the third person I talked stated the it was not scheduled. I have been very much tempted to go some where else but Home Depot back in the days did provide a excellent service before the complacency of being a part of a big company settled in to the company environment.",0,1

The Home Depot,"Home Depot Hawthorne,CA","Home Depot Hawthorne,CA. After I purchased $430 worth of plants and dirt I rented a Home Depot flat bed truck (with Emily at the rental center) to bring it all home (3.2 miles one way). When you rent a truck they go by time and by the gas gauge, not by miles. As I found out later they do this on purpose, because a gas gauge is much more difficult to measure compared to miles=numbers. I made the mistake of not verifying/ comparing the actual gas gauge reading in the truck to the reading on the rental agreement. I was tired after a long day and didn't see any reason not to trust this, I just wanted to get home. I could not have been more wrong! When I dropped of the truck about one hour and just 6.4 miles later Emily told me I had used approx. 20% of the total tank capacity! She was rude and was very unhelpful. She had no interest in hearing about the 6.4 miles total and how that could have used up 20% of the total trucks capacity. She wasn't even interested in looking into the matter. If you do have to rent a truck at home depot do carefully verify the gas gauge reading of the truck to that on the rental agreement and try to avoid Emily, because she is not interested in giving good customer service or admitting even that their reading on the rental agreement was incorrect.",0,1

The Home Depot,Purchased a GE French Door Refrigerator…,"Purchased a GE French Door Refrigerator and a GE dishwasher. Store experience was ok, but delivery was awful. The deliveries are scheduled thru JB Hunt. During the original delivery, 2 men installed the refrigerator (cracking 3 floor tile in the process) and didn’t level it while another man tried to install the dishwasher (I paid for installation).BTW when I tried to open the freezer door, the top drawer flew out signifying a leveling problem. Anyway, the dishwasher guy couldn’t remove the old dishwasher so he ended up leaving the new one in my foyer and the old one disconnected but still in its space. Contacted JB Hunt and they rescheduled another crew to take care of the refrigerator and install the dishwasher. Six days later the new crew installed the dishwasher and leveled the refrigerator, BUT the dishwasher guy left paperwork, etc, in the dishwasher while running it to make sure it worked. It did, but the paperwork didn’t make it AND the handle of the dishwasher interfered with opening a drawer next to it - must be a new safety feature 🙄. Oh, also, according to GE, there are no other handles that fit my dishwasher so, now we have to alter the drawer front.I have to laugh; crying is not an option! Beware when ordering appliances from Home Depot and using JB Hunt as installers.",0,1

The Home Depot,Deceptive advertising/They don't honor advertised prices!!!,"If I could give them a minus score I would. They would not honor their advertised price. Do not buy any big ticket items from Home Depot!On June 28, 2019 I went to Home Depot in Worcester, MA. I sat with one of their associates for over an hour (I left there between 230-3PM) picking out an Anderson sliding patio door with blinds inside. The price advertised on a sign in that store gave a price of $1299 with the Frame kit included. I told the associate I would like to purchase that door. The associate was a very sweet gentle young hispanic male. He thought that the door was in stock but when he checked the computer there were none in stock. He stated that he would order it for me and the price would still be $1299. When he went on the computer the price was $1601.06 (their on line sale price-$300 more than advertised in store). He then called his manager, Christine, on the phone to ask her to match the price they had advertised in the store. Christine told him the price that they had on their sign in the aisle was wrong and someone forgot to change it, and that I would have to pay the on line price. I asked the Associate to call Christine back and tell her that I would like to speak with her, by phone or in person. He again called her and I saw the look of panic on the associates face as the manager refused to speak to or meet with me. The associate hung up the phone and he was very apologetic, and at a loss for words, as he repeated his supervisors response that she would not honor the price they had advertised. He told me that the manager he spoke with was ""Christine"". I asked if she was in the front of the store and he stated he was not sure. I thanked this associate for his time, told him to cancel my order as I would not be doing business with Home Depot again, and went to the front desk and asked for the supervisor Christine. A young man in the Customer Service returns aisle said she was not available and asked what was wrong. I told him what transpired and asked him to notify Christine that I would making a complaint to the corporate office, the Better Business Bureau, and every social media site that I could post a bad review. He apologized and stated he would pass that message on. No one at the front desk offered to rectify this situation!I have pictures of the signs posted in front of the advertised door I was looking at in the store, as well as a picture of the online price that they were trying to force me to pay. There was a difference of over $300. And they had the nerve, not only to raise the price by $300, but they also said that the higher price was a sale price and was normally over $400 more! I am shocked at this deceptive practice being allowed by the management at the Home Depot in Worcester, MA. Needless to say I went to a reputable place when I left there and purchased my door.",0,1

We took off work, but XTO NEVER SHOWED UP. When we called they were rude, tried to deny the appointment, finally admitted that they mis-scheduled the appointment. Said a manager would call back.

We chose a new style and after waiting 2 weeks for all the cabinets to be in stock ( you can not order if it's not in stock) we finally ordered all the cabinets. Half of the cabinets came in when they were supposed to, no issues. The other half, it was determined, after being told for 2 weeks that they would be here tomorrow, we're lost in transit. So we had to cancel the order, get a refund, then re place the order. They did give us a discount for our trouble, but we were back to 2 week delivery window. During all this time, we lost our contractors due to timing. The new cabinets were delivered when promised but many of them were damaged. Two our new contractor was able to fix and hang or the damage was on a spot where it would not be seen. I did not want to hang damaged cabinets but we could not keep waiting.

Now the waste soaked ceiling will have to be replaced. the $99 toilet will cost closer to $990 by the time all is fixed!!And HD still believes they are putting ‘the customer first’unfortunately the truth is the only customer HD cares about is named wallstreet,0,1

The Home Depot,Will never shop there again,Home Depot has gotten so bad with customer relations I will never shop at any location ever again! This year alone I have spent thousands at Home Depot and in the past three weeks the customer service has ruined me or my family and friends from ever shopping there again. I recently purchased over 1100 dollars worth of tile for my backsplash the store did not have any in stock and I was told they could not order it for me that I would have to order it online which they did in the store. I said ok it took over two hours to get the order in and when I saw the total it did not add up to what the tile was priced at in the store the online price was over 1.00 more per sq ft at which I was told they could not price match that I would have to pay the online price and then was told that they could not honor my military discount either because it was an online purchase and even if they could Home Depot now only allows for a 50.00 savings for military on any purchase. Fast forward to today I had two extra boxes of tile left and went to the closest Home Depot to return them...they informed me they could not return them at that Home Depot store because I purchased it at a different location even tho the Home Depot website states that you can return any item at any location. Home Depot has become a joke and has lost multiple customers for life because of the poor choices made by management!,0,1
The Home Depot,ZERO STARS for the lousy delivery…,"ZERO STARS for the lousy delivery service that Home Depot chooses to contract with but accepts no responsibility for. I placed an order for 2 closet doors sets and paid and extra $156 for ""room of choice"" delivery since I cannot carry the 150# sets of doors in by myself and did not want to risk vandalism or theft of order. I checked my online tracking status daily and the first status change after ""shipped"" on June 6 was on June 12 with an estimated delivery date of June 18th. I contacted customer service on June 12th to see if there was a window of time they could provide since I had mandtory training on the 18th. If the 18th could be confirmed, I had 2 other dates I could reschedule the training on the same week, but I needed 24 hours notice to make the change. John advised me to check my tracking. I shared that I had already and there was nothing except ""estimated"" on the 18th. John stated he would check the next day and call me. John did not make the call. However, when I checked my online status on June 13th, I had a ""Good News! Your order is arriving early on June 14th!"" message. I called to ask for a window of time and Marsha informed me that the drivers did not need for me to be there, they were going to leave the merchandise at my door. She also advised that it was too late to contact delivery, that I needed to call back in the morning. So I did. After 32 minutes on hold for the delivery service, they disconnected the call without answering. I then called Home Depot customer care. Michelle provided the only customer service I have received in this ordeal. She was able to stop the delivery service and have the doors sent instead to my local Home Depot store so that I could arrange pick-up and delivery from there. I was informed that I should follow-up in 3 days if I had not been contacted. So, today was day 3 and the online system showed - again falsely - that an appointment had been scheduled for delivery for tomorrow, June 18th. I called customer service to see if this was confirmed, as I would need to reschedule the mandatory training if delivery was truly scheduled for June 18th. Emma informed me that the door sets MIGHT be delivered tomorrow (Tuesday, June 18th) morning and that I would be given a 30-minute notice via call or text if they were on the way. Emma also stated that if the delviery did not occur on Tuesday, that they MIGHT deliver on Wednesday or Thursday or Friday. So the meesage is that if you place an order for Home Depot delivery, you must remain within 30-minutes ETA of the delivery address for 7-10 days. From the number of negative delivery service reviews, Home Depot is clearly aware of the issue and does not care any more than their inept delivery service does.",0,1

No one showed up the next day and no one from Home Depot called me to let me know no one was coming. This is not my first rodeo with Home Depot. About a year ago, I scheduled an appointment for someone to come to my house and measure the front door and no one showed up on the day scheduled. I believe Home Depot in New Braunfels, TX does not value the customer’s time and hires unprofessional, uncaring, unconsidered personnel.",0,1

The Home Depot,Very unhappy with the service! Will not return!,"Went to the Traverse City store with the intent to purchase a weed trimmer for my husband for Father's Day, once we finally made up our minds on that, the lawn table and chairs caught our attention, after looking at them all, we finally decided which one we wanted. Stood in the middle of the aisle for a couple of minutes waiting for some one to help us, finally went to a rather rude young lady on a cash register that had just been watching us in the aisle waiting for help, and asked if she could please have someone come and help us, she said ok so I walked back where my husband was waiting. We waited another couple of minutes and when none showed up, my husband went to the other set of cash registers and asked if someone could help us and he was told someone would be there shortly. We again waited a few more minutes and none showed up! Very upset at this time we left the store without purchasing anything! We will not be back to the Home Depot in Traverse City! The entire time we were in there, a matter of 2 to 2 1/2 hrs, we had seen 3 people on the floor helping customers! The store was rather busy, I realize, but there should have been more employees than the few we seen on the floor and at the registers! We went to Lowes and was greeted as soon as we stepped into a dept! We purchased a better trimmer for less money and found a lawn table and chair set that better suited our needs and was asked by 3 people if we needed help before making our choices and seen many other workers around the store, and was in and out in a matter 1/2 hr to 45 minutes time! Lowes was just as busy as Home Depot!",0,1
The Home Depot,Delivery Straight Otta Compton,I waited for 3hrs and 45 min for our dishwasher. When they took it out of the box it had water in it. Not good. The delivery service pulled up in an Enterprise Truck playing loud music with two men that looked like they got released from prison. Acted like Thugs in da hood too. They actually looked extremely shady. Acted like unprofessional rude homies. Never again!,0,1
The Home Depot,Don't buy appliances here,"Don't buy appliances here. 2 times so far my appliances haven't been delivered on time. The first time they had 2 weeks from ordering and delivery and called 2 days before to tell me my stuff was now backordered and would take a month to deliver. Ordered different units to arrive the following weekend. Their delivery company didn't call until they were here, they're supposed to call at least 30 minutes before,and I was indisposed and when I checked the phone a few mins later they were gone and wouldn't come back. On top of this I still don't have confirmation the first items were cancelled and my money returned. Terrible experience.",0,1
The Home Depot,Do not trust them for delivery your…,I do not trust Home Depot to deliver order purchases any more. I ended up wasting of my time and money. The worst customer service I ever experienced. I made many calls to make sure everything to be done correctly but nothing was done right. I was rescheduled two times but no one showed up. Employees or managers seems have no clue how things are done in the company. one tells you something and another tells a different story. It was hard to believe and do business with them. Very very sad.,0,1
The Home Depot,Very disappointing delivery experience…,"Very disappointing delivery experience with Home Depot. They never made the phone call 30 minutes prior to showing up. When they did arrive at 9:50 a.m. they called the wrong number and left 5 minutes later. The delivery company calls me at work to say no one was there for the delivery and they would reschedule. I told her no one called my cell as instructed and her reply was ""cells are not reliable!!"" Maybe because he didn't call it. So I insist they come back and called the driver myself. He responds ""you weren't there, we left""... he finally agrees to come back. In the meantime I call the delivery company who says he refuses to return. I call the driver again who says he's on his way and hangs up on me! They finally come back and install the dryer and in the process do not use the vent I was told I had to have. I ask where it is and he responds on the truck.... well give it to me so I can return for a refund! After signing the paperwork, he says was this the phone number to call, no it was the number on the sheet listed as NUMBER 1 contact. Nice customer service and they definitely do not have their act together. If I wasn't desperate for the dryer I would have gone to Lowe's. The customer service in this chain has gotten really bad, beware.",0,2

The Home Depot,zero stars for this amateur hour third rate paint store,"zero stars for this amateur hour business...I blame myself for trusting this third rate paint store to deliver home moving boxes and supplies to move house. After I spent more than $600 on boxes, shrink wrap, bubble wrap, etc the order was cancelled by Home Depot for no known reason. I only even found out about Home Depot cancelling the order because I decided to check the tracking on the order to make sure it was going to be on time for the scheduled delivery tomorrow, where Home Depot tells you the order will be with you between 6am and 8 pm.....and you must sign for the delivery, but they will leave it outside your building... When I tracked the order number I was shown a cancelled order. I did not cancel it, and the money was shown as a pending charge on my Paypal statement, so Home Depot put the charge through , even tho they cancelled the order. When I called customer service the staff member told me she would see what was happening and help me...45 minutes later she is still back pedaling and refuses to connect me to a supervisor. This slow torture is inflicted on you by a woman who speaks in a cartoon scripted sing song voice and has said awesome more than 60 times during the phonecall. Joy is her name.Joy, ...nothing about this situation is awesome. She is a woman of few facts and lots of scripted bits of nonsense that mean nothing but are meant to make it seem as tho she is very professional and knows what she is doing. She does not. She tells me I have to go to a Home Depot store and pick up 60 boxes and huge rolls of bubble wrap....I tell her I am not renting a car to do that, and where is my money you stole from me? Still no answers....what a waste of my night and Home Depot has succeeded in screwing up my move. AWESOME Joy! Thanks for making life harder for a New Yorker...I have so much time to waste I think I will have a great night of surfing moving box sites now, and spend an hour comparing prices and choosing box styles and sizes and then pay about $600 to another seller, in hopes of actually receiving a delivery this time. Home Depot...your Customer Service stinks! No supervisor on duty in a call center full of phone workers? I don't believe it. If you don't even value your customers enough to speak to them when there is a problem , nor solve the problem , nor refund me the money you took for an order which you then cancelled minutes later, you certainly don't deserve my business. There are other choices....and I won't choose you next time. Refund me my money now.",0,1
The Home Depot,Zero stars,"Zero stars! Ordered a $2,000 fridge last week. They tried to deliver to wrong address even though I called and confirmed address twice! They refused to deliver to correct address because the PO was already done. They told me I had to cancel the entire order to change the address. I cancelled and told them I would purchase elsewhere. Two days later I received a paypal refund for $32.00. Knowing something was instantly wrong, I called customer service once again to be told not to worry about it and to check my account again in one week. One week later I am now on the phone with customer service going on an hour now....telling them the same information over and over. I am actually arguing with her that I NEVER received the fridge. She is telling me to call paypal! Why on earth would I call them? Home Depot is the one that should be confirming a refund. What a circus! I have only purchased from Lowes and this was my first and last purchase ever from Home Depot. HORRIBLE customer service.",0,1
The Home Depot,Would give zero stars if I could,"Would give zero stars if I could. I’d planned on writing an essay regarding Home Depot online, which is apparently a separate entity from Home Depot. I say this, because 1800 Home Depot will not get involved in online order problems. As I said, I’d planned on writing an essay, but others have already done so. Mine would be redundant. Suffice it to say, buy from the store, but NEVER online. I’m out 12 hours and $120 I paid a contractor to wait on a dishwasher that never arrived. I bought two dishwashers for different places. Long story, but no resolution in sight. I plan on writing as many bad reviews as I can. No telling how much time (and time is money) I’ll be out by the end of my review writing.",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot Delivery Service,"So we order a dryer from Home Depot last week with a delivery date of June 10th between the hours of 2:30-6:30pm “non-negotiable”. 7pm rolls around, so we give them the benefit of the doubt that they are just running late. By 8:30pm I’m getting mad and we’re calling, only to get an unavailable message. They set the time, we held up our end. Made multiple phone calls until we got someone on the line only to say they couldn’t get ahold of the company either. I call this morning, of course upset about not getting our delivery. Spoke with not one, but two reps who insisted the company attempted delivery because that’s what they “wrote” in the notes. Apparently at 4:12pm the delivery company did their 30min pre delivery call and at 4:13pm they knocked on the door but no one was home. Really? A 30 min pre-delivery call and attempt to deliver one minute later? Absolute lie! At that time there were 10 people in our house, and no one answered? I don’t think so! So after speaking to the third person, I got someone with enough sense who called out to the delivery company, only for them to explain that they in fact never attempted delivery as they noted, because they assumed they could not access the community. So no one thought it would be good customer service to call the customer and discuss logistics? Is it that hard to have common courtesy? After two more escalated calls, I’m being told that Home Depot will not take responsibility for the third party service THEY contract and it’s up to me to deal with the delivery service and manufacturer for their fail to deliver. So now I’m expected to wait another week for delivery, and compensation will be discussed after I have signed for the delivery that is late on their part. We will get No accommodations to deliver sooner when they are the problem not us. So with that being said The Home Depot , you are a disappointment and shame on you for passing the buck. This is horrible customer service. We absolutely will not be giving you our business again. Lowe's Home Improvement you have a new customer. Better Business Bureau | US, this is unacceptable. Companies should not be able to inconvenience customers for their own convenience. To lie about having rendered a service that was never rendered is bad enough!",0,1
The Home Depot,Very upset,"Never buying appliances from Home Depot and having them shipped again. I currently went to Home Depot in Flint Michigan. They were out of an air conditioner that I wanted, so they talked me into ordering one online and having it shipped to my house. I never received it. I called back 7 times they finally told me to take it up with my bank that They will not refund me or send me another one I am now out of close to $500",0,1
The Home Depot,Do not purchase appliances at Home Depot,"Washer machine broke and I, just like seven years ago, purchased a new washer and dryer at Home Depot. Had no concerns given my previous experience purchasing appliances. Never again, a complete disaster. To be fair the sales person at the store was very knowledgeable and helpful. I knew the make and model that I wanted but she made sure that I had purchased everything needed for installation. We scheduled a delivery date and time window. The nightmare began on the delivery date. I had chosen a time window between 7:00 and 11:00 am. The Robo call I received the night before indicated a time window between 2:00 and 6:00 pm. I adapted and made adjustments to my schedule to accommodate the new time block. At 6:30 pm I had not heard from the delivery driver so I called the number provided in the Robo call. I spoke to someone at the third party delivery company who advised me that they were coming just running behind schedule. At 7:30 pm the driver calls me. He tells me that I need to call Home Depot on Monday morning to reschedule as they have 2 more deliveries ahead of mine and it would be to late by the time they arrived at my house. The driver also shared that this happens all the time because they over schedule and I didn’t have all of the necessary parts anyway.I call Home Depot who confirms that I must call Monday morning to reschedule because the third party service provider is now closed and not open on Sundays. I tell them that the driver indicated that I needed additional parts to do the installation, he checks my order and tells me no, I have everything needed. I am also told that this is not a reflection of Home Depot because this is a third party company and they should schedule deliveries better. I object to that statement, indicating that Home Depot (not me) contracted this company to do the delivery and installation. It was their choice to use this company so it is the responsibility of Home Depot. I call Monday morning and the next delivery date is Thursday. It’s now been over a week with no washer or dryer so I agree to Thursday, knowing I will have to take time off from work. Again, to be fair, the women I spoke to seemed concerned and told me to call her the day before so she could personally verify the delivery time.On Thursday, the delivery driver called to to let me know they were on their way, it was 2:00 pm. They arrive and I show them the existing appliances (that I paid to have removed). They immediately tell me that they can’t remove them or install the new ones due to the location on the second floor. I was confused and told them that Home Depot had delivered and installed the existing ones, in the exact same location, six years ago and the new appliances were the same dimensions as the old ones. They informed me that there company is very strict and they could not guarantee no damage to the walls when moving the appliances. They also told me that the appliances were heavy. Yes I agree that washers and dryers are heavy items which is why most people have them delivered. They ask me if I want the appliances and, if so, where they should but them. I call Home Depot and am told they will contact another contractor to remove the existing appliances and install the new ones. I instruct the delivery men to put the appliances in my living room. They do, having indicated on their paper work that removal and installation not possible due to safety concerns.Home Depot has a local contractor call me that afternoon. I explain the situation and he agrees to come to my house the next day at 8:00 am to determine the cost. I contact the manager at Home Depot who tells me they will pay the charges but to call him once I get a quote. The next day, having taken another day off from work, the contractor arrives on time. He reviews the job and gives me a price. I call the manager at Home Depot who tells me that he can’t pay that price. The contractor asks to speak to him and explains his fee and why. I get back in on the phone and he tells me that he can not authorize that fee and that I can return the appliances. Seriously? I ask him what he is authorized to pay and it is half of the cost. Completely desperate at this point I agree to pay the balance. The contractor removes the old appliances and moves the new ones into place. Him and his team were so pleasant and professional, incurring no damage to the house and getting it done. They then proceed to install the units only to find out that I don’t have all of the required connections and the electrical cord has the wrong adaptor. I call Home Depot, talk to the manger, who tells me to buy what I need and he will reimburse those expenses with, are you ready for this, a Home Depot gift card. Unbelievable. One day spent waiting for a delivery that never came, two days loss of work to accommodate new delivery date, an additional $350.00 in installation charges and additional hardware expenses. As I write this, I am waiting for the contractor to return with the necessary parts, the ones Home Depot assured me I had with my delivery, so that he can finish the installation.While there are individual Home Depot employees that truly do care, the company does not. “Thank you for shopping at Home Depot” is the only consistent message you will receive.",0,1

I explained I absolutely needed a drill for work the next day and even suggested landing me a beat up one anything together me through the day and could not help! Asked for a refund so that I could go buy a different one in the store! No help! Could get a refund for 2 to 3 days! Could not buy one because they had my money!

The Home Depot,Stay away from Stamford Home Depot,"Went to the Home Depot in Stamford ct today and my wife and I were frustrated.,,angered... and it was a total unsatisfying experience. One of things I was looking for was a spray to wash your house with. They only had one more product there made by Scott’s and there was basically half a self allotted for it. The product was 9.97 and I needed 7 so I asked two salesman for help and were basically blown off by them and they told me there were none left .I waited on customer service line and asked if they had any left in stock according to computer.... low and behold there were 5O in stock and it told them were on upper self it was located ... to make a long story shorter ... after 30 minutes and 2 more salesman they found the spray and I had my 7. I get to cashier along with other purchases and item that was on self and clearly said it was Scott’s and gave a description and price rang up double at register. After much debate and about a 20 minute fiasco ...manager meets my wife with item by now barren self . He says it’s in wrong spot and basically sorry about your luck even though Scott’s item was described to tee on sign. They are a bunch of lazy people as salesman blow u off .Obviously they don’t want to give any customer service as I was there basically an hr and a half and didn’t walk out with what I wanted. Manager was rude and uncaring. I thought this place was great when it opened but poor management and Change in staff has made this place a stay away from and take a ride to Norwalk or portchester as service there is much better",0,1
The Home Depot,Inconsiderate and unhelpful,"Yesterday I walked into The Home Depot, hoping that someone there would have a bit of knowledge about the plants and flowers available (versus a cheaper competitor). The Garden Center outdoor help/cashier plainly told me that she doesn't know anything about gardening or even which products were available. Being on the opposite end of a plant/gardening aficionado myself, I had already walked amongst the racks of options in search of some mosquito-repellant potted plants and flowers, only to discover the search trying. The woman on the floor made no effort to help, other than to, at a loss, direct me indoors. No doubt she could see me instantly turn disagreeable. I wandered back through the aisles, hoping something would jump out at me to no avail. When I walked past her she asked if I had found anything and I simply said ""no"" and continued walking toward the back of the garden area. She calls after me then and shows me on her phone that she looked up a certain item and it shows they don't have it in the store. By this time, it didn't matter. I had wasted my precious morning wandering around to no satisfaction. Had she begun by helping me, perhaps it would not have been such a miserable experience.It doesn't stop there, however. Indoors, 3 or 4 people are standing around with one of them climbing up a stock ladder and one of them dragging some metal shelf full of products across the concrete floor. The commotion and noise combined were like nails on a chalkboard. All I wanted was to peruse the 3 rows of plants they had displayed, but no one so much as budged to move out of my way as I tried to maneuver the cart in between and around the gossiping group.I finally make my way to the pot/planter aisle, where 3 employees are arguing about the importance of which of their jobs needs to get completed first. I ignore them and continue browsing the pots, careful not to back into the random grill parked behind me when all of the sudden I catch it moving out of the corner of my eye and see one of the Arguers lugging it sort of toward me as he maneuvered it into a position in which he could push it out of the aisle.He caught my eye as I guardedly eyed the grill, ensuring he didn't accidentally run into me, and he kindly asked if I was finding everything okay. Although I had a lot or responses on the tip of my tongue, I simply said, ""yes.""The store is fortunate that I purchased anything at all.Other Home Depot stores have also been just as inconsiderate and unhelpful. I will not be shopping any Home Depot again.",0,1

The Home Depot,My husband and I were gifted a Home…,"My husband and I were gifted a Home Depot gift card and visited the store in Fort Smith last Thursday evening around 6:00 pm with a list of items we needed and wanted to shop for a new washer and dryer. We were looking at a $1400 washer and dryer and couldn't find anyone to help us. Finally someone came by on a forklift and wanted us to move out of their way. We asked if someone could help us an he said he would find someone but 10 minutes later we gave up. We needed some chain cut so went to that isle and couldn't find anyone to help us cut the chain. Finally a lady said she would find someone to help and we heard the announcement assistance needed in the chain cutting area but again, we waited over 10 minutes and still no one in sight that could help us so we went to the paint dept. Again, there was not a single person around to help. We didn't wait this time and went to the garden center. I asked a person at the checkout for a sales flyer so I could see what items were on sale and was told I needed to walk to the front of the store to get one. We did get a sales flyer and came back to the garden center but none of the plants were marked with sales prices so we couldn't tell which plants were on sale. We purchased a large bag of potting soil and some fertilizer to use what was on our gift card and left. We will never walk in that store again. We went to Lowes, found everything we needed along with a much nicer selection of garden plants. While we were in the store looking at the washers and dryers a very nice sales person approached us and helped us with our questions. Lowes is a much better shopping experience.",0,1

So I drove 30 minutes to town to fetch it myself at store. Was then offered a $200 substitute for a slightly smaller tank w.t.f !! Bait and switch. Customer non-service says i can only order that one online. I say ""that online thing just dont work for me so u do it for me ok."" After big hassle they finally confess They CANT do it either ! Problem is i cant pay with a home depot gift card. Ok now.. they can sell the gift cards online but you cant use them online at the exact same site that sells them so w.t.f !!! And now im standing there in the store and cant use it there either. They say its got value, but refuse to accept their own valid gift cards. Nice gift !! Then the Plumbing manager refuses to special order the item for me to the store, says i just have to order it online myself and.. PAY... for it, as if using my gift card is like trying to get it for free w.t.f !! He wont or just can't help me. I finally just gave up trying and found a friend to trade my ""gift"" card to at a big 20% loss and he ordered the damn thing on his amex card ok. They just loved that payment. I learned that store credit and gift cards are dubious at best and probably a scam. They only want cash and credit cards -- no hd cards accepted. Big fail !! I saved that card from my dad for an emergency... only to find out it doesn't work in an emergency... unless your willing to get ripped off and your willing to accept a smaller inferior unit too for a much bigger price.Then it took literally 2 weeks tracking it from rhode island to Detroit on some unknown delivery agent moving slower than a turtle. Again w.t.f ?? 2 weeks .enroute. while i have no water and leaking pipes !!! I could literally drive to rhode island and back in 2 days myself so why 2 weeks moving in slo-mo to your store ?? 5 days to cross one state what happened is the delivery driver drunk at the bar on a bender or w.t.f. ?? 5 days traveling across ohio ? Nice vacation dude.Bottom line : Home depot sucks !No willingness to help. No willingness to ""make it right"". No willingness to substitute product or make price adjustments like at Kroger where i work would do. Managers have no authority to fix and just dont care.Zero stars.",0,1

The Home Depot,Appliance Suite -- Nightmare,"We purchased a suite of 4 appliances in November. 3 of them were installed incorrectly. The hardware holding the microwave in the cabinet over the range was stripped, causing a potential of the microwave falling. The refrigerator had the water line kinked in the back of the refrigerator causing the refrigerator to malfunction. After numerous service calls, this was finally discovered. The dishwasher was set to start automatically when it was installed causing us to struggle to figure out how to stop it, and that caused it to lock making it inoperable with a full load of dirty dishes. There have been about 10 service calls overall since November causing us to take off of work for their 4 hour window. The last service call, after waiting 5 hours and calling twice to check on the technician, was a no-show. No apologies from them. Today, they came to replace the defective refrigerator. They sent a team from the store to pick up the old refrigerator. They arrived without tools, and scratched our hardwood floor very badly. We asked them to put something down to protect the floor, and they refused. When I called the assistant manager at the store, he said all he could do was file an insurance claim. This is such a nightmare. Now I have to deal with an insurance company on my floor. Very poor customer service, and no responsibility for their actions.",0,1

We had to wait three months (Feb, 2019) for the microwave to be delivered & installed. Ralph's Trucking did the install. (BAD!) No put in right, put their foot on our new range, scratching it, and pulled the control bazel down on the range! The microwave was damaged beyond repair! (needed to be replaced!) Here we are - STILL waiting for our replacement: HD said, none in stock, don't know when we'll get one for your bad install and damage. PS: LG sent a repair company on the stove - guess what: left out screws on front control panel of range and it was loose! I had to fix it correctly and buff out the scratches left by Ralph's Trucking delivery/installers!! Home Depot will NEVER have our business again - for anything!!

The Home Depot,Mu husband and I ordered a dishwasher…,"My husband and I ordered a dishwasher for our rental unit in Chicago. Home Depot was going to deliver and install this item one week later. Home Depot came with the dishwasher to the apartment and when the installment guys opened the box they found a broken dishwasher. They took the dishwasher back and said that we had to wait TWO weeks to get a new dishwasher. Since we have a rental unit we were in need of a new dishwasher installed on the agreed day (or legal and financial consequences would follow). After several phone calls to Home Depot where the customer service refused to send another dishwasher (that they had in stock) we had to cancel the order and go with another company. Home Depot said that we would receive our refund 10 days later on the charged card. Today - 30 days later - we have still not received our refund for the dishwasher we waited for, got delivered broken and never received. They did not only put us in a very stressful situation but they also kept our money. After calling Home Depot today, their customer service is claiming that they can’t refund our charge on the card (as agreed on earlier) and that we physically have to go to the store in Chicago. My husband and I live in Florida so this is not possible. They have lied to us about refunding the charge on our card, made us wait for weeks to then refused to refund us. Both my husband and I have been loyal Home Depot customers for as long as we can remember. We both thought that Home Depot, with their size, was an honest company. We will NEVER buy anything from Home Depot again. We have spent so many hours on the phone with their ignorant customer service that won’t lift a finger if you’ve already given them your money.",0,1
The Home Depot,Purchased a grill that came in bent all…,Purchased a grill that came in bent all to pieces and immediately contacted customer service. Apparently the grill i ordered was now now on backorder so they told me to pick out another grill to replace it with. We agreed on a grill and the supervisor said i would recieve it by April 26th to have the old one ready to ship back which I did. Nothing showed up so I called April 29th. Apparently that grill was on backorder as well and no one informed me of this. So once again I called again and they had me pick out yet another grill to be shipped and this supervisor informed me i would have to pay for this grill and get a refund on the other grill that was damaged. So I've been waiting for a grill now for month total. There customer service is horrible and need to get there stories straight. I'm very aggravated over this been a loyal home depot customer for 20 plus years and I'm never gonna go there again. So don't waste your time with ordering anything from them because you're going to end up with a headache and multiple hours on the phone trying to get stuff resolved.,0,1

The Home Depot,Commercials are better than the experience,"OMG...The consultants selling kitchen and bathroom counter tops did not know that center islands have cook tops. Or so they said. Being that they were trying to convince me that it was perfectly normal that I would have to hire a plumber if they installed kitchen counter tops for me because they could not handle the water or gas connections...What!!??!!What made it worse was the nasty ten year girl bully ""I know you are, but what am I"" behavior. ""I've never heard of a center Island having a gas cooktop"". Two females said that to me in a very nasty snarky tone of voice. What were they...jealous. That's how they were acting. Like jealous school girls instead of working professionals. And you sell home improvements? What planet are you from. Home Depot also refused to send people to take measurements for bathrooms, countertops, etc. They demand that you do it. And they charge you $35 to measure the floor (and the estimate was incorrect.) I even had someone give me a home depot tape measure so that I could go home and do their job for them. Unbelievable. I mean, who puts up with this crap. I told those morons off after one of them pretended to lose the estimate she was working on, then proceeded to the nasty ""I've never heard of a center island with a gas cook top"" comment. Then this ""child "" turned to her friend to allow her to chime in in an continued attempt to ridicule me. I guess that they forgot that I was a customer and this wasn't the playground. Ladies, this is not the play ground, I am not your friend and I do not care what you think. I was there to purchase a large quantity of home renovations. That was apparently my first mistake. I told them to forget it and walked out with my $50,000.00 plus. (Please, she just didn't save it because she was being a child and thought she'd hurt me.) I went elsewhere (Sears Home Improvement) where I got better service and quality for few thousand dollars more. Definitely worth it. Home Depot sucks.

I called to confirm to make sure everything was set in place. I was told by both Home Depot and Whirlpool companies that I had to opt for installation during checkout in order for the delivery team to uncrate, set in place, level and connect your appliance. They'll also test it for functionality and inspect it for damages. Well, this put me in a panic mode. There was NO place to check this option during checkout. I wasted an entire day speaking to numerous people in customer service to add the installation to my order! I thought it was a given to uncrate. Who expects a person to uncrate and set-up a refrigerator? But Home Depot and Whirlpool INSISTED if I didn't check the box when I ordered it online then the delivery men will leave it crated in my home. By the way, it doesn't even come crated. It comes with only a boxed top, styrofoam on the sides and plastic. And the delivery team uncrated it and set it up despite the ignorance of Home Depot and Whirlpool. I give 2 stars to them since although they were ignorant they were nice, nice ignorant support that wasted my day.",0,2
The Home Depot,Delivery Disaster,"I ordered an appliance from home Depot a few months ago set up for delivery. Home Depot did not allow me to choose my delivery date, or my delivery time. When they gave me a 4 hour delivery time frame in the middle of a Tuesday, I called to ask for an evening delivery time, as my spouse and I both work. They would not give us an evening time frame, they would not let us reschedule our delivery date, our only option was to cancel the order completely. So basically don't order anything from home Depot unless you plan on taking the entire day off of work for a 10-minute setup. Even better, I started a brand new job the day before my delivery, so there was 0% chance I could take the day off or even have my phone on me for the gracious ""half hour"" advanced call that they provide. When I reiterated this to the woman and said that I shouldn't buy any more appliances from them unless I can take the whole entire day off of work, she said I guess not.

The Home Depot,Dear General Manager:,"Dear General Manager:On 3/16/2019, I bought several Whirlpool appliances. I made this purchase at the Home Depot store located 2020 Lynnhaven Parkway Virginia beach, VA 23456. I spent over 3hrs and $5911.70 cash, in your appliance department, I purchased a full kitchen of appliances with your associate Charles sheerin, who by the way was very helpful and knowledgeable, however he failed to inform me that the installation for the wall oven and cooktop needed to be contracted out. I paid for install, and was under the impression that they all would be installed the day of delivery; why wouldn’t I have the wall oven and the cooktop installed, it’s beyond me why if these items needed to be contacted out why wouldn’t the associate Charles offer the services, oppose to me waiting 15days to get my appliances and then having them left in the middle of my kitchen floor, due to the delivery crew not being able to legally install them. And need I mention the refrigerator is on back order until the end of April. I had been planning a dinner party for months, for a very special 60th birthday on March 31st I was excited and eager to spend my money with Home Depot, and get the color preference appliance. I believed I had just enough time to get my appliances set up for a great dinner with friends and family. But that didn’t work out the way I planned, and yes I have to say it is related to the associate, Charles; not advising me that I needed to have those two very import elements to my kitchen contracted out, we could’ve set that up when we set up the other installs and date for delivery. So with that said. I am very disappointed that I had to wait until the day of delivery to find out that the only way I would get my wall oven and my cooktop installed would be via contractor. My thoughts were to send all the appliances back. I called Home Depot, and spoke with Charles on 3/30/2019 the day I received the appliances, and yes he confirmed that they would be glad to get a contractor out to my house but not that day, because that is something that needed to be pre-arranged, so I ask why didn’t he give me that option. He went on to apologize and state he can contact some of the contractors that Home Depot uses and have them give me a call, not to get them over to my house. Needless to say I was livid, at this point, and ask why I wasn’t told at the time of ordering. I ask to speak with a manager, I was given another associate and with every question I had, I was told they had to check with a manager to get the answer, finally I spoke with Shawn who is also an associate in the appliance department, he said he remembered me from the night I was in the store for three hours working on my Kitchen, mind you I could have gone to another competitor, but I choose Home Depot. Shawn asked me a few more question and said he would get with a manager and give me a call back. In the meantime, per Charles ; I’m waiting for a contractor to call me in hopes that someone could come by that day to get the wall oven and cooktop installed, during that day I received two calls one said they couldn’t get there until April 4th and the other contactor sited 5-7 business days. Well of course that wasn’t going to work, “I was planning a dinner party that evening”. So I started calling around and found someone who charged a pretty steep installation fee to install the cooktop and the microware, I needed it done I had guest coming for dinner. Turns out The wall unit is too big for the space, Home Depot will be picking it up on Friday for a full refund, So now my dilemma is do I order the size wall oven that I need from Home Depot or will I receive the customer service that I deserve with your competitor. I just purchased my home in December and there are a ton of projects that I am considering, I will be adding a deck, a gazebo, I need a new Garage door and perhaps windows and a few doors. Unfortunately, this chain of events caused a huge problem for a special moment in my life. I trust this is not the way Home Depot wishes to conduct business with valued customers, Home Depot has always been my go to Home improvement store. I would appreciate your consideration concerning this purchase and ask for compensation for the inconvenience that was caused; perhaps Home Depot is willing to reimburse me for the installation fee of $200 as well as installing the wall oven at no cost, if I decide to make the purchase with home Depot.SINCERELY.",0,1
The Home Depot,WARNING! Beware Home Depot/XPO Logistics Appliance Delivery,"Home Depot uses XPO Logistics for its appliance deliveries and installations. This company, if you search has a 1-star to negative stars review rating across the USA. In all fairness to Home Depot, a lot of other companies use them including Lowe's. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Are they the only company that so many use them? XPO has a long history of beyond unacceptable behavior in making deliveries of large appliances and also in their failure to perform installations as required by Home Depot and in the customer agreement, as advertised. Just google reviews of XPO Logisitcs and you will see their history. Trust Pilot doesn't have them in their database as a seperate company. I ordered a washer/dryer. They showed up and immediately told me they couldn't install it because they ""thought"" (they are not plumbers) that I should replace the valve. I had a plumber out the week before to check that everything would be fine for a new installation, he checked the pipes,the valve, he opened drywall to check behind it and certified it and gave me a $175 invoice. I showed this to these non-plumber delivery people, but, they refused to install it. They took the new unit out the box and put it in the middle of my kitchen and then routinely asked me to sign a piece of paper. I told them, ""the hell I am not going to sign anything and get that machine out of my kitchen."" He, then, LIED to me and told me that they would have somebody come out to help me with my valve in 48-hours and install it. I told them I am not signing anything until I know i have a working washing machine. Then, they cursed and reluctantly pulled the new washer out of my kitchen and left. Also, they wrote on their delivery notes to Home Depot that the Whirlpool washer came with a standard 4-foot hose and I needed a 6-foot hose and they don't install it because it would void the warranty if they use a non-factory part not in the box like a 6-foot hose vs. a 4-foot hose. Turns out 4-foot hoses are standard on most washing machines, but, this is a stackable in a small closet. A 4-foot hose is more than enough length. Again, they are LIARS and not experts. After complaining to Home Depot, who advertises that the installation is part of the deal (a $100 fee added) XPO sent a licensed plumber to my home to check it out. Their 3rd party licensed plumber laughed that there was no leak or anything wrong and agreed that it was ridiculous that I would need a longer hose than 4-foot in a tight small closet area, but, told me he would authorize replacement of my valve and that XPO would bill the service to Home Depot (to make more money off of Home Depot, of course, payable to XPO and their plumber, for no reason, Is that crazy? So, XPO sent a licensed plumber back to my home on a 3rd visit who cut the drywall and replaced a perfectly fine valve with a new one. Not to mention that I had to pay at my expense and time to find someone to take care of their cut into my drywall, for no reason to install a new valve. I then scheduled a new delivery date. Again, this is after a 2-man delivery team and 2-plumbers had been in my home on 3-dates to assess my home for the delivery and installation and told me that everything was now perfect. On the scheduled delivery date, a different XPO crew comes out and decides they don't want to perform the installation, either, giving me a different excuse that the dryer hose that goes to the outside wasn't a perfect fit and I should get a handyman to fix it and get a flex valve, but, conveniently, even if I did that, XPO does not install a flex valve and won't complete the installation because they say it voids the warranty if I use a flex valve because it doesn't come in the box of the unit. The unit I had before used a standard valve and not a flex valve, so, again they are LIARS and simply did not want to perform the installation. But, yes, they tried to dump the new washer in the middle of my kitchen and leave it there and get me to sign and accept the delivery. The hell I didn't and they cursed and took the machine out and as I write this, I have to start all over in gettng a machine and this is a major hassle. First, Lowe's and Home Depot both use this horrible XPO company for their major appliance deliveries and I've asked my plumber and he does not get involved in installing washing machine/dryers. Can you believe this? I'm now using coin laundromats wasting half of my day off for a month now and I don't have a solution yet and when I decide what to do, I will have to wait for a delivery date and lose my promotional discount when I originally bought it and it is not easy to find an independent person who wants to install a washing machine/dryer you didn't buy from them. I don't want a non-bonded handyman, but, most plumbers do not perform this service. What a mess. But, I'm not alone. XPO Logistics is all over the internet and it seems to have a monopoly in contracts with many big box retailers. I don't understand why such a monopoly exists for this BAD COMPANY and why Home Depot and the others do nothing about this.",0,1

The Home Depot,TERRIBLE,"TERRIBLE, SIMPLY TERRIBLE. This has to be one of the worst experiences that I have encountered. We waited over a month to have a California type closet installed. After a month I called them 3 times to finally spoke with someone who had no idea what the problem was. No one ever called me back. Again, after numerous calls, I finally spoke with someone who said ""I was going to call you today. She said the parts will be here on 3/25 and schedule installation for then. The called a week later and said the parts came in so the wanted to come out early. I agreed. The day they were to arrive between 8 and 9 AM, no one showed. Just before 11 AM the installer called and said he was running a little late. When he arrived he put the closed together but said the forgot the drawers. He said said he was going to check back at the warehouse and see if they were back there and he would call me by the next day. The next day no phone call I called Home Depot again they said they have not heard from the installer my son tried to hang up some clothing but the closet was installed improperly the metal pipe fell off and cut my son's neck.

The Home Depot,I bought a washing machine from Home…,"I bought a washing machine from Home Depot because it could be delivered one week sooner than the identical product at Lowes. I paid for the appliance on February 27 and installation was scheduled for March 12, a Tuesday. When the installers came, they said I had no shutoff valve at the existing washer connection. I couldn't reach my plumber immediately, so they dropped the washer off in my garage and gave me a phone number to call when I had a shutoff valve installed. They said they were in my area every Tuesday through Saturday. My plumber came the same afternoon and pointed out that the shutoff valve was in the cupboard above the washer. I immediately called the phone number the installers had given me and was told they were only here on Tuesdays and Thursday and that Thursday, March 14, was already booked so Saturday was the earliest they could complete the installation. On Friday afternoon, I called to confirm the time on Saturday and was told there was no record of my appointment. I was then rebooked for installation on Tuesday, March 19. I had to cancel two other appointments to be available on Tuesday. Today when I called I was once again told I had no appointment, that my installation had been completed on Tuesday, 3/12, because the washer had been delivered then. To have the installation (for which I had paid) completed, I needed a work order from Home Depot. I was then put on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up and finding a Home Depot number to call. The end result is that the installation is now rescheduled for Thursday, March 21, the day on which I rescheduled one of my Tuesday appointment, which will now have to be cancelled again - and it's a hair color appointment, which is not a trivial thing!Not a good experience. I hope this isn't indicative of the service I can expect if I need repairs in the future. Wish I'd gone with Lowes or RC Willey.",0,1

And i am done shopping with HOME DEPOT. I have purchased everything from paint to kitchen cabinets from you all, my business will be going elsewhere from now on. And tried contacting Corporate Head Quarters before writing this review, to no avail just direct you to a hot line number.",0,1

It arrived on a Thursday and we didn't set up until Saturday evening as my son was going to help with setup of the new dryer and remove an old one. When we opened the box there were 3 dents in the dryer but it was past the 48 hr return/notification window and so no return for me. I think the driver knew it was damaged, dropped it at the door and took off before anyone answered. I have had no response from them and I think they should refund my shipping costs.",0,1
The Home Depot,Free 2 Day Shipping is a Joke,I ordered a tower Fan online on Monday morning with the free 2 day shipping. It should have arrived on Wednesday.

Find a store that has what you want and pick it up in person. Or you could order from another company.The free 2 day shipping is a Joke!,0,1
The Home Depot,They Don't Screen Their Employees,"I have shopped extensively at both Lowe's and Home Depot for many years. Home Depot does not screen their employees very well. I had people renovating my house go to both places to buy building materials several times when I was out of town on business. I gave both places my credit card information over the phone. At Home Depot, they stole my credit card information and made unauthorized purchases. It never happened at Lowe's. I met several people in my personal life who worked at Home Depot and that just confirmed for me that Home Depot does not screen their employees well at all. I have to buy appliances soon, and I'll go to Lowe's because I don't trust the employees at Home Depot with my personal information such as my address.",0,2

In which our counter tops had to be replaced because our fridge panels were the wrong size. Fast forward to the redo of the fridge panels... CFI the contractor that homedepot subs there work to, didn’t put any protection down on any of the finished flooring, had their tools sprawled out all over our foyer, these guys were butchers, if I wasn’t there to check the redo the new panels would have been put in wrong... the installer had the audacity to say I was splitting hairs here... I get into an argument with him saying if I measure 66” up top of the opening I should have 66” at the bottom and not 65 3/8. I had to tell him to redo it again because my trim kit for the refrigerator would not be square. He did fix the panels to correct dimensions for the 3rd time... now fast forward to dealing with there managers at the store to get this rectified, time delays, run around and I ask for compensation for the work I did above and beyond what the contractors did.... I’m a electrician by trade so I know the process in great detail of how to take care of a customer, I call it the white glove treatment and homedepot customer service managers taking care of this mess was an absolute mess, and they have an upset customer because of all of this.What a Kroc, these guys are a joke, and I would never get anything from them again, nothing but aggravation and headaches",0,1

The Home Depot,I like the washer however if you have…,"I like the washer however if you have it delivered BEWARE they unbox it without asking, and take the box with them (the accessories are taped inside the box so the manual shows included but those items are long gone!) Spent a hour at the store where I searched for similar items to replace the missing elbow holder and hose caps. I also got the drier that goes with this washer, it has a water connection and comes with a splitter and hose guess where those were? I'm guessing in the box at some far off warehouse getting crushed. Once I realized what all was missing, ade a list and brought the owners manual that listed what was included, as mentioned before searched the store for those items (as suggested by appliance person) the Next Great Step was that I waited another eon for them to write that stuff off as damaged so they wouldn't charge me for the missing parts. Most of my time was being sent to appliances and then back to customer service. It would be best to not let them unpack it without checking the box for other items in it. Or just ask they leave it (the washer) in the box. If The box is damaged take a photo and note it when you sign the delivered slip. I would then unbox it yourself. So nothing can come up missing. Also of note talking with other people that have had a washer delivered and installed, they have a hard time installing it (leaks/ not level/ hoses backwards) so why even bother with that? Home depot review person:Look if your not going to post this review stop asking me to review it, buying it and having it delivered are one story for me (a bad one) so please post this as there is no separate section or survey for the delivery, and the Home Depot experience was less than expected and disappointing to say the least, Its like getting a new phone and no charger, so go find who delivered mine, explain they don't meet home depots standards (I assume), place a mark in their employee book and if they continue to disappoint you should consider replacing them, or lose more money to Lowes (where I shop more often now, in part due to this).If you don't like working for Home Depot, or having to deal with this selective hearing review method, my free advice run.",0,1

I told them I . don't mind waiting for it to get to the store. The said they do not get them to the store, they only ship to your house and it's $75 to ship. This made no sense to me. I could understand if they ran out of stock or I had to travel to another store, or I had to wait a week to get it delivered to the store at no cost to me except the advertised price. I even told them I would take the floor model. They said, no they are not allowed to sell the floor model. I asked to speak the manager in the Corneluis NC. She said that's the way it is, kind of an attitude, no real explanation or understanding of how this makes no sense. In a nutshell. They advertise a price that's not possible to sell for. If there is no way you can buy the product for the price shown it should not be advertised in the store. Makes perfect sense to me. Please enlighten me if you see another way of looking at this?

Eventually they told me the appliances would be delivered but a week later. They blamed the supplier or vender (what happened to instock !?!) I told them no i can't wait so cancel it. They said the can't and just wait for the appliances to come and then don't accept them. I said i can't do that because i need the money back to go buy appliances elsewhere.

The Home Depot,Don't care about their customers at all,"Due to a lack of in-store choices on a replacement sink for our powder room, we had to order one online. The one my husband chose with a very nice design to it was not inexpensive and there was NO indication that this sink would not fit into a ""normal home powder room"". Even in reading the specs, there was nothing that led us to believe that this sink sat so close to the wall that the current plumbing would not fit into it correctly. The main pipe coming into it would have to be cut down to fit properly and the drain stopper both rubbed on the inside and dug into the wall behind it. After paying for the plumber to start installing this, we decided there were too many issues with it and had to have him come back to un-install this one and install the replacement we found. I contacted Home Depot to let them know of the issues and suggesting that the proper thing for them to do would be to send out an installer, for this 2nd one, at no cost to us. They refused. Then I suggested they pay the very low cost of our plumber for the re-install, and they still refused. The person that I was in contact with seemed to NOT care in the least about their customer relations or trying to make the situation right, even though this was caused by their website not having a full, proper description of the item. On other sites, they clearly state the sinks are ""small', or ""tiny"" or ""full size"", etc. Home Depot had no such words in the description and since the cost of this was more than many others, we had no reason to believe it may not fit in our small powder room. The least Home Depot should have done to make this right was somehow cover the re-install. We had to pay twice for their inaccurate website information.",0,1

The Home Depot,Buyer Beware!,"I am working with a contractor to replace my kitchen cabinets which sustained damage during Hurricane Maria. My cabinets were ordered from HD #6402 in Puerto Rico on July 31, 2018. They arrived on island early in October. Due to scheduling conflicts with other repairs and my contractor travels, my install did not begin until November 10, 2018. My damaged cabinets were removed and one new cabinet was unpacked. Imagine my dispair when I discovered the wrong color had been sent! (I had worked with my contractor for months, always asking for a dark mahogany color, and had, in fact, been in communication with him while he was placing the order) What was sent was a light-medium colored cabinet. Despite how devastaed I was, knowing I would be without a kitchen, I told the contractor to send the cabinets back. It is now February of 2019, and I still do not have my replacement cabinets. My contractor attempted to work with the store, and reported he would either be on hold for long periods of time, the call would ""drop"", or, if he did speak with someone, they were unhelpful. On the 29th of November, I became involved and began calling corporate, as well as the store. I experienced the same issues with the store, but I did actually speak with the salesperson who sold my cabinets, who stated my contractor did ask for mahogany. This continued for almost a month, where I was making calls every few days. What I was told, by Home Depot corporate offices, is that it is up to the store manager whether they decide to exchange or return merchandise, and that the store has to watch their bottom line. Corporate cannot, or will not, override the store. This is an unacceptable situation. It took over a month and a half for anyone at Home Depot to even agree to exchange the cabinets, but they are requiring a 15% restocking fee. Mind you, no consideration has been made for the time I have spent, without a kitchen, during Thanksgiving and Christmas. This particular store is a home improvement store, in an area that was hit by 2 Category 5 hurricanes. I know they have been extremely busy and their ""bottom line"" is in no danger. This shows how ""compassionate"" Home Depot is toward their customers.",0,1

The Home Depot,Another Reason I Mostly Shop Amazon,"I’m in the area and decide to get one of my online wish list items at a “brick-n-mortar” location instead. I’m usually shopping online but I decide to give the physical world another chance. My need/want? A cordless jigsaw. My main goal was to have a complete cordless setup for an immediate project with others to follow. I got an associate to help with some difficulty and more than a few PA announcements. He had a fairly good attitude. Eager to help too. However, he lacked knowledge for this dept. More and likely, he was sent to fill in for someone else either on break or out sick. And, after my experience here, I don’t blame anybody for taking a day off work. He tries to help by finding me the jigsaw itself albeit not my brand of choice. Then, the battery. This is where this associate really shined. He upsold me to the big macho-man battery as compared to the weaker baby sized one. Now, I need a small assortment of blades. I’m starting to get motivated. Wow! I really misjudged this guy. So, I ask if this is everything I need to get stated. He said yes and I’m on my way. Another job well done by Home Depot’s finest. I paid the $196.97 and walked out proud having supported the local economy. My unusually brisk pace slows as I get a feeling of something amiss. Perhaps something a saw at a glance? I look in the bag. Saw? Check. Battery? Check. Some blades? Check. What’s wrong here? I look at the Jig saw box again. The charger has to be bought separately. I go back in the store to the same associate. I don’t use the, “Hey you” angry approach. Instead, to see his reaction, I act like I’m “Not” smarter than the tool and say: “Excuse me sir. I was just wondering how I recharge this battery. Or, is it disposable? I thoroughly enjoyed this method. His actual response? He was unsure. “Maybe it’s rechargeable? Let me see the battery. Oh it is rechargeable.” Internalizing my laughter, I saw the price for the only available and compatible charger. It was an additional $80. No longer funny. So, $286.97 for one cordless tool, battery, charger, and a few blades. By comparison, a Porter Cable brand 20V “combo” kit containing: a drill driver, impact driver, circular saw, reciprocating saw, oscillating tool (for detail sanding), orbital sander, flashlight, two 3AH batteries, charger, carrying bag, and the jigsaw I originally needed. All for $299.00. I didn’t buy the charger and returned the items I just bought.",0,1

There is a huge error here where every support person (every person I spoke with was disgruntled and not able to help me) and me running around calling all these departments is broken and not right. Why is this so complicated for me as the customer. In addition, I had to call to reschedule the installer. Booking told me they only book but they don't cancel or reschedule. WTH!

The Home Depot,Will Never Shop At Home Depot Again,"spent over $3,000 to buy flooring and baseboard from the East Wichita store. During the process I was told by two different employees at three different times that I also had to remove the casing from around the doors. This seems strange to me hence the reason I asked more than one person and more than one time.In fact the casing did not need to be removed and you can't properly install the baseboards unless the casing is up first. When we asked about adding installation of the casing to the order were told that could not be done and we'd have to hire someone on our own. It was suggested we talk to the installer to see if they could/would do it.Keep in mind that but for the Home Depot employees telling us the casing had to be removed we would not have spent time removing it and money buying new casing. We contacted the installer - cooper installation - who said they didn't think there would be an issue but needed to talk to the people doing the actual installation first. We then get a call from Home Depot about wanting to add additional services to the contract (which we'd tried to do weeks ago and were told we could not). The cost to add this was going to be $891! That is only slightly less than what we were paying to install flooring and baseboards in three rooms, a walk in closet, and a hallway! We explained this was not acceptable and contacted Home Depot corporate to see what could be done since this was an issue caused only because of what we were told by Home Depot employees.Ultimately we were told we could hire someone ourselves and submit the bill to Home Depot and they would then see if they could do anything to help with the costs. This went back and forth with us explaining over and over that this didn't work since we needed to have the casings done as soon as the floor was done and before the baseboard was installed. We were then offered a $200 credit (meaning we could pay $681 to fix the issue caused by Home Depot)!!!!When the actual installer (sub-contractor for the place Home Depot hired) came to start the project they were surprised at the casing being off and explained what we already knew, that this would be an issue with getting the baseboard an casings installed properly so they looked right and fit correctly. The on-site installer gave us a quote of $300 to do the casings ($591 less that the Home Depot quote). However, since they were contracted through Home Depot they could not do the work without approval. I tried to call the customer service number but the people I need to talk to don't work on the weekend. I was told to contact the local story and see what could be done.I called and ultimately went to the Home Depot on Woodlawn in Wichita, KS to see if this could be resolved so I could get the project done today. I was repeatedly interrupted and talked over when I tried to explain to yet another person at Home Depot what the issue was and what needed to be done to fix this.I asked that the installer be called and given the okay to do the casing installation and I'd pay the $300 out of my pocket to get it done so the rest of the work could be done. Instead all I was told over and over was that I could have a $200 credit against the $891 installation.I ended up cancelling the baseboard installation entirely and walked out with a refund. Now I have to not only hire someone to do the casings but I'll have to hire them to also do the baseboards and my house will remain incomplete longer.A simple phone call today would have fixed this and cost Home Depot nothing. Instead you had to refund me money and have lost a customer.I urge everyone to make their home improvement purchases any place but at Home Depot.",0,1

The Home Depot,False theft accusations,"On Friday January 18th, 2019 I went to my local Home Depot store located at 15655 Roy Rogers Dr in Victorville, California. I went to the toilet seat section to make a purchase. I was then approached by two men, one whom appeared to be white and Mexican(Store Manager) and another white associate. They then said to me, “One of my associates pointed you out saying that you had a whole bunch of cleaning supplies and denied showing the receipt of your purchase.” They then asked me to leave and told me that I can no longer shop there. I then proceeded to tell them that this was my first time in the store today. The manage then stated that he will check the cameras. I have numerous issues with this situation and the way it was handled. The first being, the associate should have notified the manager when said issue happened with whomever it happened with and the cameras should have been reviewed at that time, prior to making FALSE accusations.Second, Being a BLACK man in America, the intimidation and humiliation I experienced for something that I did not do does not sit well with me. I need to be contacted by The CEO in order to resolve this issue, this should have never happened and I refuse to let it happen again to an innocent person, whether they are black, white, purple, or yellow.",0,1
The Home Depot,Avoid Home Depot at all cost,"Purchased a gas slide in range at Home Depot. Arrived late and damaged. We didn't realize it was damaged until we removed the plastic wrap after connecting. Now faced with $300 in unhook-rehookup charge, offered compensation from Maytag and Home Depot but it never arrived. Made several calls to the HD customer care center at 1-800-759-2054 who speak with Maytag and inform us that they will contact us but never do. After our first experience with Home Depot major appliance purchase, would AVOID PURCHASING A MAJOR APPLIANCE AT HOME DEPOT AT ALL COSTS. If you're in the market for a damaged appliance and are willing to pay full price for it, Home Depot is your store (extreme sarcasm).",0,1
The Home Depot,Just wanted to let you know,"Just wanted to let you know. I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future. I am tired of being called a lier at this store. I'm in this store at least 2 times a day People that work there know me by name. We spent $ 65,000 their last year check the pro rewards not counting what my family spent there. I have been going there for almost a week now getting 25 samples of paint working with one girl I found some miss-matched paint that I thought would work for my project the girl asked the manager about it he said 50% off so I finally figured out I could use that paint. Today I when I went to purchase it I was told no way that could happen I was wrong, making me feel like I was making it up, after a bunch of back and forth with 3-4 different people they told me 25% off is all they could do again making me feel like I was making it up. This is about the third time I 've been put in this position I don't like this feeling. They acted like I was asking for something for free and like I was not the customer and they were the important one. I don't have to be treated this way and my money is good someplace else Going to switch to Lowes. I'm sorry because this store is close to our business but I drive around the valley so I will just figure out a different route. This is the store at 91st Ave. and Peoria Ave.",0,1

It was unusable, so the installer took the parts from the defected stove and put them on existing stove. However, the repaired stove is coming apart again. I can’t use the oven.

The Home Depot,They steal peoples money,My wife went to the Texarkana Texas store to purchase a gift for me. They had to order it online and they told her she couldn't pay cash but that she could get a home depot gift card and order it that way. They did not disclose the fact that the gifts would not be able to be returned for a refund. They took $400 of her hard earned money and stole it. We found all this out when we tried to return the items at the longview Texas store where we live. That store treated us like second class citizens. I will never forget the smirk the agent had on her face telling us it didn't matter that we paid with our cash for the card. Never again will I walk into a Home depot.

The Home Depot,I WISH I COULD GIVE MINUS…,"I WISH I COULD GIVE MINUS STARS!!!!!!!!! This is a bit long post but worth the read to save yourself some heartache.Home Depot on Meadowview Road in Sacramento, CA. WORST STORE EVER AND VERY DISHONORABLE!!!!! Appliance Speciallist (HAHAHA), KEITH FOSTER is a very dishonest person. I would not buy a light bulb from Home Depot is they were the last company in the world selling them. I would rather pay a competitor's higher price than shop in this store ever again.On November 27, 2018, I went into the Home Depot Store at 1471 Meadowview Road in Sacramento, CA. I purchased a Samsung refrigerator ($2,000.00 for fridge) and dishwasher at black Friday prices. The assistant who helped me was KEITH FOSTER. Delivery was to take place on December 21st which it did. Upon arrival the refrigerator did not fit as expected into the space (I purchased 28 cubic and it stuck out way to far). I send the refrigerator back and immediately contacted MR. FOSTER to let him know that I would not be taking delivery of the refrigerator but would like to purchase the same refrigerator but at counter depth (22 cubic). By now the price had gone up to $2699. I was told they would not honor the black Friday price at this point. OK, I still wanted the refrigerator so would have to bite the bullet and pay the extra money. I inquired as to whether they did competitive pricing as Costco had the same fridge for $100 less and was told they did. MR. FOSTER informed me that he would contact me as soon as the original purchase was returned to the warehouse and credited. He did so approximately 4 days later. I told him I was ready to purchase the refrigerator at the new price. He told me to hold off and he would contact me on Thursday (Jan 3) or Friday (Jan 4) as they would be having a sale and the price would be lower. I TRUSTED HIM! BIG MISTAKE!!!! I did not hear from MR. FOSTER so I went on line to check on the new price. Imagine my surprise when I saw that the refrigerator was now $3,299!!!!! I tried to contact him and he would not take my calls. I then called and spoke to a manager who told me ""I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE. SO SORRY, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT."" I was livid!!!!! Since he didn't return my calls, I went into the store to face him. His response ""miscalculation on my part"" and proceeded to be very rude. In other words too darn bad. I will never purchase another item from Home Depot (which I was previously frequently a few times a month at least). I WOULD NOT PURCHASE AS MUCH AS A LIGHT BULB FROM THESE DISHONORABLE PEOPLE IF IT WERE THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT SOLD THEM!!!! I WOULD RATHER BURN CANDLES AND COOK OVER AN SPIT IN THE BACK YARD!!!!",0,1

The tracking says it will arrive on the next buisness day. So on the 27th it doesn't arrive and I call in only to be reassured it was on it's way. The 28th...29th...30th I finally start calling daily until it says the product was sent to our nearest Home Depot storehouse. So i call in and get put on hold for 30 minutes then get disconnected. I call in again and get put on hold almost just as long. I had to hang up because I have a life. I then call in one last time get put on hold and the girl finally just says the people she's calling are not answering. So I cancel my order completely. I asked if i could go pick it up physically and I guess that was not allowed for some reason??? Whatever In will never order anything online from them again and they lost my $700.",0,1
The Home Depot,Unprofessional behaviour,Totally unexpected behaviour from a company like Home Depot. I am still waiting for the complaint we raised one week before regarding our kitchen project.

The Home Depot,Purchased LG washer and dryer from…,"Purchased LG washer and dryer from Douglasville GA store in November. Was informed that dryer was not available for delivery until the 26th of December so delivery would be then. No problem....was fine with that. In the interim, LG called to tell us the models we ordered were discontinued and would we accept newer model.......again we said sure no problem. On the morning of the 26th of December, I got a call from delivery service that HD outsources to that they were on the way to my house. Unfortunately, forgot that the 26th was the day and was not at home. Delivery service said someone would call shortly to reschedule. They never did. That evening I called the 800 HD number and the delivery service told me my order was cancelled. When I requested to speak to supervisor that individual said completely incorrect and my delivery would be on Friday the 28th. When I never received any prior call for a time frame on the morning of the 28th I called the 800 HD number again. Was once again informed that my order was cancelled. This time the supervisor also said my order was cancelled and that I could either call LG corporate or my local HD store. I opted for the call to HD Douglasville and requested a store manager. Terrance promised to look into it and get back to me. Seven hours later I called Terrance again and he said their attempt to get delivery that day was not successful but he would get back to me on Saturday the 29th. Once again, no follow thru and it is now Sunday the 30th and I am still waiting. Home Depot has lost the concept of customer service.",0,1

The Home Depot,Online orders are a disaster,"I ordered a major appliance on Black Friday and scheduled a delivery for December 22nd, however we decided to cancel the order on December 10th. After dealing with dead end phone menus to try and cancel the order I finally got through to a human. We were provided a ""case number"" for the cancellation and thought this was all resolved. They state that my credit card will be credited within 3-5 days.A week goes by, still no credit to my credit card so I am a bit anxious. December 22nd comes (12 full days after I cancelled the order) and a truck shows up trying to deliver a refrigerator! I get back into their nightmare of phone menus of trying to talk to a human, but the major appliance menus all go to dead end options that don't allow you to actually cancel an order (even though the option does say ""to cancel..."")...so you have to get to a human through the regular online order options, and then they have to transfer you to someone in major appliances, and then...endless transfers and repeating yourself over and over. I finally get to a human, and they say that ""we have to wait for the delivery company to process the return authorization, so call back after 72-hours"". Which I realize is another disaster as Christmas is within that window, so really this means I have to waste more time calling them back in another 5 days? I already have 2 hours on the phone into this mess.After protesting the customer service rep talks to their supervisor, after waiting on hold for a length of time he comes back and advises me that they came up with a solution to update my original cancellation case and that the refund should automatically process within 3-5 days. During all of this time they have charge on my credit card for $2500+.Do I trust that this will actually happen? Hardly, so I am also opening a dispute for the charge with my credit card company as this is no longer an authorized transaction.",0,1
The Home Depot,Doesn’t even deserve a star,I’m only choosing 1 star because I have too choose something. The experience I have had over this dryer repair is completely unacceptable. Approaching a month without resolution and multiple visits from a service company only to have to cancel that work order and now wait minimally another week and all at Christmas. I would assume a company would thoroughly vet third parties before having them act on their behalf. What this experience has done is taken a loyal Home Depot customer/family and turned them into to a Lowe’s customer.,0,1

They said it would be ready 15-20 minutes, at 30 minutes they said just another 5 minutes, at 2.5 hrs I finally had part of my order. Cuz when you buy something at Home Depot they will sell it out from under you and when you show up to get it, ITS GONE!!!!!Then they say that they will get you taken care of and you don’t hear from anyone... Holy cow if you try to call and get help!!! Expect to get frustrated!!!I could go on for a while but you get the picture.",0,1

We got a fantastic price and the set itself has awesome reviews and is beautiful.We ordered the ""stacking kit"" hardware to go along with it so it could be set up on delivery. When the technicians arrived -- who worked for GE and not for Home Depot -- they had been sent the wrong hardware set and they said we would need to exchange it. It takes me an hour to make a trip to a Home Depot store, so I thought I would just call. My beef is that I tried every number I could find to call HD and got the circle around of recorded answers, with no option to talk to a human. I ended up having to spend the time and gas and fight the crowds to return the part -- and they did not have the other in stock so had to order it anyway! And that store customer service would not take the wrong part back because the online order had been ""assigned"" to another store. I have never before been to a retail chain that did not honor another store's return! The in-store appliance dept rep at Epps Bridge Athens was very patient and professional and went through the whole reorder process, waived the $59 (!!!!!) shipping fee for the replacement brackets and set up another service call for no charge. So the lady in appliance department got 5 stars but the customer service absolutely stinks!! And I had to make a drive to another store 30 miles away.",0,1

I did not hear anything.Following up from this I contacted CS again around Nov 28/29 and was told that the product had now reached Mississauga and would be delivered to our closest store very soon.Called today as there was still no news and I have been told that the delivery was meant to be today, but is being pushed back by two days with no reason given.These delays are seriously impacting the renovations and have cost us due to delays for the contractor.Had a completely opposite experience with a direct competitor for a recent hardwood flooring purchase and will only be shopping from them moving forward.",0,1

The Home Depot,The worst managers ever.,"Our family came into Home Depot on a mission to buy a new refrigerator. Ellie, the customer service rep, was somewhat helpful. Although Ellie did not have any information on the products, she still was willing to help us in researching the specs on fridges we were interested in. We made a decision and began the purchasing process. We were interested in setting up a Home Depot credit card and scheduled for delivery. Ellie mentioned the registered price was significantly higher than the advertised price by $600. She tried a few coupons but couldn’t get the screen to match the advertised price. We asked the speak to her manager in hopes that he could override the system or assistants in communicating error. Deryl showed up 30 minutes after being paged three times. He didn’t introduce himself or have a warm and empathetic approach. He simply listened to a summarized version of the story and immediately turned to us and said “There’s nothing I can do. Our system was supposed to update the advertised price, but it didn’t do it.” Honestly, the faulty internal process is not our business or problem. Home Depot should honor the displayed and advertised price. If your system isn’t working, then he needs to appoint a staff member to double check displayed prices prior to opening the store. He should have honored the price. He had zero empathy for the situation and frankly, he was off put and annoyed by the situation rather than being solutions driven. It’s unfortunate because all of families have used Home Depot for years, but as of today, we will be taking our business elsewhere. I did say this to Daryl and he simply shrugged his shoulders and said “ok.”",0,1
The Home Depot,Would give zero stars if I could.,"The service has been dropping as fast as a lead brick at Home Depot. I've tried THREE different Home Depot stores and they all have the same type of issues and it all stems from their management team. Mostly it's the assistant managers that are the problem but the store manager is the captain of the ship and must take responsibility ... ESPECIALLY when they have been informed of the problem people. I have spent well over $15k in the past two years or so. I've spent a lot of time in these stores and the problems are consistent. I actually altered my shopping/pick up days & times because of certain managers & employees. I've had REPEATED conversations with the store manager. He was always quick to give me a little money off because of all the time they wasted of mine. But as I tried to tell him REPEATEDLY ... I don't want a discount, I just want good service. Money is fine but time is much more valuable to me. Even more important is the attitudes of their managers & employees. I will not tolerate an attitude from any employee of any company. I don't treat my customers that way and I won't tolerate it from someone else. End result ... Home Depot is now on my 5 year boycott plan. I will spend more money somewhere else before I would ever give HD another penny. In 5 years I'll give them another shot and see if they decide to treat their customers with dignity, respect & excellent customer service. GO TO LOWE'S IF YOU CAN. If HD sales drop enough they will get the hint.",0,1

Well, it has been an absolute nightmare from the 2nd meeting on! Not a single customer service associate has told me the same thing. I was promised calls from vendors that NEVER came, because supposedly they did not have the correct phone number, even though they had provided the correct phone number to the Counter Top vendor (THEY had NO trouble contacting me). I sent emails over a 2 week period and left 2 phone messages. Nothing. Once we made it over that hurdle, the cabinet order needed to be altered with SMALLER cabinets on the top, well, they claim they could not just change those cabinet sizes they had to re-do the ENTIRE order. This is after they have been paid for, for almost a month. Then, I am informed the cabinets (I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR) are now more expensive and I will have to pay an additional $1700 for them. NOPE. I was very frustrated and irritated and was told that ""maybe you need to go calm down before we continue talking about this."" Really? No offer to try and help, no apologies, just a ""you need to calm down."" After speaking to the Assistant Manager of the store (Nisha?, Nicia?), I was promised she would call me that evening... Nope. No call. No response from her at all actually (its been 4.5 days). I was told that if I decided to have my money refunded to me, that all I had to do was call today. Well, Guess what? I called.

It was to arrive in 10 days. I could see, after two days, that it was located about an hour north of me. Apparently, a week later and without notifying me, Home Depot ""automatically"" re-order it for me: to arrive, again, in 10 days. At that point I phoned the store it was going to. They apologized but said that they could not cancel it ""yet"". Then when I checked a week later, I saw that the time frame had again been moved to 10 days later. This time I phoned their on-line 800 number and they cancelled the order without objection. This may not reflect on their stores, but I would certainly try to avoid ordering from them on-line again.",0,1
The Home Depot,Manager Paul at the Billings MT store…,"Manager Paul at the Billings MT store locationI normally don't write a review, nor have the time, but it has been many times that Paul the Manager has done more that a manager duty at that store and wanted to compliment him on his stellar efforts.About a year ago, I had a generator which I purchase ""crap out"" on me. I thought it would cost me a new generator, but Paul helped in looking into the fuel and even the carburetor and retuned it right there on the spot giving me fuel octane buster which got the generator up and running and for two years strong now. Another time was in the electrical department in recommending the solar motion detector lights for an off gird home. Lastly, and the best was today in taking back a Steam shower unit build in Europe. It was a unit which didn't meat the requirements for American connections nor was it even legal according to plumbing codes. He spent an hour or more on the phone with the vendor and really looked into this then after all that gave me an in-store credit which was what my wife and I wanted. Hats off to Paul and also his work efforts which span so many areas not only in one department but across the board. Thank you sir!",0,5
The Home Depot,Shameful Customer Service,"I placed an online pickup order yesterday around 10am. I went to pick the item up around noon. There was only one elderly gentleman working at the “Service Counter.” He could not even see his computer screen. He was trying to help another couple for about 20 mins. I do not mind waiting, but this is excessive for an online PICKUP. I could have gone in the store 3 times, purchased the item, and checked out. Instead, I had to resort to speaking to a floor supervisor who was not polite or helpful. He and another man made a call and said that the service counter ""is apparently not moving fast enough for me.”. I asked the man if he could walk next door and retrieve my drill for me. He said he couldn’t and proceeded to take a customer that walked up. He even had them step around me instead of being helpful. I wait at the Service Center for another 5 minutes, and Tonya appears to help me. Oh boy is she excited about it! I explained my situation again and she was unhelpful. Then, a Lift Operator named Ashley who was the MOD came over to me and gave me no good reason. She said it was a common complaint across the company. This is unacceptable and I will not be using Home Depot in the future. I will also be telling every single person I know to do the same.",0,1
The Home Depot,Very poor customer service and delivery,"Very poor customer service. Went here to buy appliances, ended up going to Lowes to shop because of the nightmare treatment! The associate working in appliances needs to learn how to listen and how to respond to a customer's request. Right now I am at Lowes across the street setting up a quote for the purchase of the washer, dryer and refrigerator that I was going to purchase at Home Depot in Egg Harbor. I did call corporate to voice my concerns about the experience. It's a shame as I prefer Home Depot but they sure do not care about treating customers right in this store. I will give corporate one day to figure this out before I finalize the Lowes order. UPDATE: Within an hour I received a call from Matt, the manager on duty, Corporate contacted the store manager who contacted the store to have them contact me. May be resolved within a day. Will find out soon.2nd UPDATE: Forget about it being resolved. I talked to Matt, an assistant store manager, told him I would come back in since he PROMISED to make it right. I ordered the 3 appliances the next day. I then received notification that my delivery would be between 1:30 and 5 PM on 31 Oct. Well, it is now 31 Oct, it is now 6:32 PM as I type this and I do not have any appliances. Called customer care, they were worthless. They put me in touch with a person in millwork. Yea, I guess this store has no managers on duty or managers at home that can handle a phone call.From the store manager on down, this store is an absolute disaster. They do not care about you, they do not know what customer care is all about, all they want is to take your money and then the heck with you. I am so sorry that I did not rely on my instincts and go somewhere else. I am sure that no other store could provide such absolute horrible to an individual as this store has.",0,1
The Home Depot,Wasteful products,"This is a great ant killer but the picture tells us everything that is wrong with packaging today. The bottle on the left I bought 8 years ago. A couple of drops on the path of sugar ants in the kitchen. They take it to their nest where it kills all for months. I’ve finally run out. You cannot buy it any more. Instead you must buy the packet on the left. Both contain the same amount of ant killer, but with the packaging on the left you only get 6 shots instead of 8 years. That’s wasteful.Worse, when you snap off the top, you get the fluid on your fingers. Not a good idea with ant poison. It takes a lot longer than administering a drop from the bottle. That’s a waste of time. Even worse, the packaging is four times as much. That damages our environment. The reason is so the manufacturer and retailer can sell more, make a greater profit. Such waste has got to stop. The people to stop it are the retailers. Wal-Mart, Asda, Home Depot, B&Q, and many more. They have the power to say, ‘We are not selling the wasteful, environmentally damaging product on the right. We will only sell the bottle on the left.’Shame on Home Depot who sold it to me. For that reason, they get a one star review. If you agree, then share on FB.",0,1
The Home Depot,I guess I should have read these…,"I guess I should have read these reviews before offering thousands of dollars worth of doors from Home Depot. My experience was beyond unacceptable and their solution is just to refund. I had more than half of the doors I ordered come in damaged. Took pictures, called their resolution team...no response. The front door was so damaged becaause there was zero packing on it. I did keep it, but only after a discount so my carpenter could fix it. So really, I'm paying full price and having to work extra hard to get a finished product. Then the rest of the doors come in and more than half damaged. Asked for a discount and was willing to reorder, but their solution is to just refund. So now I have to return all because it was matching design. Not too smart Home Depot. I called and emailed numerous times, even tried dealing with the store manager, but again, they took the easy out for them and just want to refund. This leaves me, the customer, without doors and a huge amount of lost time. The aggravation alone is worth a discount. But again, they ignored me and basically just don't want to deal with it. Really poor management when it comes to customer satisfaction. Now they lose me as a customer, and I'm going to make sure you all know what your in for with this company. I guess their so big us little folks don't count. Guess what? Shouldn't have picked on this customer.",0,1

Friday came and went and no generator, no explanatory call. Called my local Home Depot and they said they didn't have anything to do with online orders but would look into it and reported that the truck was too big to deliver and they needed smaller one. Still no generator a week later. I called again and was told they needed approval for a smaller truck. I got a message yesterday they would deliver this coming Friday between 7am-2pm. A 7am delivery. Seriously. I needed another generator and ordered it on Amazon. It was here in three days. Home Depot is definitely unreliable, inconvenient and well, useless.

We spoke with the police officer stationed there and no trucks or cars were prevented from passing. We tried calling Home Depot delivery and the store manager and each time were hung up on. The delivery department told us to speak to our local store. Our local store told us we needed to deal with the delivery department. We still have no stove and no delivery date. Home Depot’s behavior is shameful. They take your money and refuse to reschedule and meet their obligations. Do not buy from Home Depot. I have never seen such poor customer service.

The Home Depot,DO NOT Buy appliances from homedepot. DO Not Buy Whirlpool,"We have been remodeling our kitchen and have spent well over $20,000 at Home Depot doing so. One of the last steps was appliances and plumbing. I purchased a brand new Whirlpool dishwasher model #WDT750SAHZ from Home Depot in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Once delivered, it sat in its spot in the kitchen for 2-3 weeks without being hooked up to water or electricity. I payed Home Depot’s kitchen contractors to hook it up once they installed my plumbing. After installation and the contractor was gone, I noticed the dishwasher would not wash the dishes! It did NOT work! I had the contractor come back out (which took a week) to make sure it was hooked up correctly. It was. I then called Home Depot and they told me it had been over 48 hours since delivery and therefore it was out of there hands. Nothing they would do about. I told them I do not want this dishwasher and I want it replaced. They sold me a completely broke, brand new dishwasher, and I paid their contractor to hook up, and there was nothing they would do for me. The manager at the Auburn Hills store was completely rude and treated me very poorly. After all the money I have spent at HomeDepot and for HomeDepot to say “It’s out of our hands”, is rediculous. I then called Whirlpool and yes it was under warranty. After another week of waiting, whirlpool came out and told me the Washing motor was not working and needed replacement. On a brand new dishwasher. Which they sold to HomeDepot, completely broke. I now am waiting another week for them to come back and replace the motor on my brand new dishwasher. I told whirlpool also that I do not want it fixed, it needs to be replaced! It’s never even been used and it’s broke! What happens in a year when it’s out of warranty and it breaks again? The whirlpool lady told me I could purchase an extended warranty for a fee. Are you serious?! I have also called HomeDepot Corporate office to file a complaint and the women I spoke to (Angela) was also very rude. After explained what happened she sat silently for a moment, then read the online statement that ‘since it was passed the 48hours, Home Depot will not do anything.’ Never did she say with meaning, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t believe that.’ Nothing. Just the online statement and where I could find it. This just makes me sick. I will never buy from HomeDepot or Whirlpool again. Not only do they not back there products they treat their customers extremely poor. After all the money I have put into your companies. I discourage anyone from shopping for appliances at Home Depot or purchasing any Whirlpool products! I hope no one ever has to go through the stress these companies have made for my family and I.",0,1

The Home Depot,Terrible customer service. Very frustrating and dissapointing,I recently order blinds for $7800. Order was delayed several times. When order was delivered it was incomplete. I was given several dates for this to be completed and 3 months later still have not received anything. Some of the blinds are not hanging properly and it seems everyone is pointing fingers rather than trying to resolve the problem. Customer service said to talk to the decorator. The decorator is pointing at the installer. The installer is referring it back to customer service for home decorating. The last time I tried escalating it to a manager at home decorating I was told she would call me back. That was a couple of weeks ago. Pathetic customer service. Would never use them again.,0,1

The Home Depot,I would give them 0 stars if I could,"I would give them 0 stars if I could. 3 weeks ago I purchased a washing machine from Home Depot. Little did I know that Home Depot farms their installation out to Temco. Temco's installers did not connect the water hose properly to the washer which resulted in 1 inch of water all over the first floor of my condo by the next morning, less than 18 hrs after they installed the washer. I filed a claim with Home Depot which they farmed out to Temco as the installer. Temco has denied my claim as I don't have 'in the moment footage of the leak"" and ""tampered"" with the connection before they could see it and therefore cannot prove it is their installers fault (ie. first instinct was not to take a photo but to try to stop the water leak and further flooding of my house and getting to my neighbor's house as I live in a condo). This is insane since I never had water in my house before they came and the water was coming from the washer hose!Home Depot & Temco have been absolutely useless in this process and are taking no responsibility to solve this or take liability for the issue. If Home Depot farms their deliveries out to a 3rd party that is not the consumer's issue and Home Depot should be claiming liability for their subcontractors work and customers should not have to be dealing with their subcontractors who they did not purchase from. I have over $50K in damages to my home (walls had to be torn out, kitchen cabinets torn out, tiles damaged, all appliances removed) and cannot live in my house properly with no appliances. Over 3 weeks since the incident and I am no closer to a resolution and nothing has been done to get my home back in order.So note to consumers, buyer beware if you ever purchase anything from Home Depot, they do not know what they are doing for a simple washing machine install and good luck getting them to help you or take liability for any issues they, or their subcontractors, cause. And even if your house is flooding, take pictures and videos ""in the moment"" or you too could be stuck in this type of nightmare.",0,1

The Home Depot,Bad experience,"We recently ordered all four major kitchen appliances from Home Depot. We chose all LG units, refrigerator, slide-in range, dish washer, and microwave. I paid to have the appliances installed, because although I am capable, I'm at an age that I no longer want to wrestle them around and fight with installation issues. We were told that we would have to wait 2 1/2 weeks for the next available delivery installation, and we agreed that while not ideal, it was acceptable. The delivery came on time and within the window that was promised. All went well until the installer told me he could not get the old dishwasher out because the floor planks in front of the old unit were too high. He said the only way he could do it was if I had the floor in front of the dishwasher notched. I asked if he could raise the leveling feet, but he said no it wouldn't work. I told him to leave it, and I would make arrangements to have the unit removed. He said I had thirty days to call and reschedule the installation. Needless to say, the new dishwasher did not get installed and is sitting in my garage. The next issue was the installation of the under cabinet mounted microwave. The old unit was removed quickly, but when the mounting plate was ready to be installed, I was told that the mounting screws were stripped and it could not be removed. I know I heard a lot of grinding indicating that the driver was chewing up the screw heads. I'm not sure if it was stripped already or was stripped when he attempted to remove it. The installer then said he would be able to use the old plate, so I reluctantly and against my better judgment agreed.Once the unit was hung on the plate, he began drilling into the cabinet. Judging by the amount of time it took and the sound of it, absolutely no care was taken to insure the holes were drilled correctly. When the bolts were inserted to snug the unit up, there was a ¼” gap on the right side between the unit and cabinet, and the other side was flush. I brought it to their attention, and was told “If you look at it from the front you can’t see it.” Now I knew for sure these were unqualified delivery guys in way over their heads. It seemed as though they honesly thought it was okay to look that way. I had him loosen the bolts and slide the unit over to try and get it right, but as soon the bolts were tightened, it pulled it back off center. He said there was nothing he could do because ""This unit is not as wide as the other one.” Also during the installation, his helper knocked a cordless drill off of the cabinet by accident, and it landed hard on the floor in front of the range. I thought for sure he had damaged the flooring. After inspecting it closely, there was no damage, but only by luck. Not a lot of care was taken because they were in a big hurry. Apparently mine was their third installation of the day, and they had two more installations to go. It’s not that the guys were openly disrespectful to me, but they were either unable or unwilling to do the job right. It felt as though they were in such a hurry, any bump in the installation was going to end up being my problem and not theirs. The refrigerator and range did not appear to have been leveled, the protective film wasn't removed, the internal packing was left in place, and the kitchen was a mess. Wood chips and dust left in the cabinet, the water dispenser wasn't air purged or checked for functionality, filter not installed, etc. It was a shoddy rush job by guys who were heavy handed, poorly trained, poorly equipped and rushing through the job. After carefully re-examining the dishwasher, I am confident that by raising the leveling feet it will easily clear the floor planks without having to butcher the floor. I will complete the installation myself and pursue the issue with Home Depot. Since the unit was not installed at all, I am not going to pay for that aspect of the bill.The microwave situation will have to be corrected by removing the top mounting bolts and slotting the mounting holes to slide the unit over, essentially butchering the cabinet. I will level the refrigerator and range by myself as well.It’s a reasonable expectation to get a simple job done right, especially when you’re paying for it. This shouldn’t be a technically challenging job for an installer, and I shouldn’t have had to look over a pro’s shoulder and tell him what he’s doing wrong.I'd like to think The Depot would get a clue. Hundreds of bad reviews, horror story after horror story, but no end in sight. They obviously do not care. I should have checked this site out BEFORE I laid out my hard earned cash.Bad experience overall, live and learn. If you want it done right and can do it yourself, do it. It might take me longer, but I know it will be right. This was a hack job, and I will never again allow one of these so called ""Installers"" near my house.",0,1

The Home Depot,Abysmal Appliance Delivery/Installation,"Purchased a Samsung French door refrigerator and matching over-the-range microwave for delivery. Waited patiently one week and confirmed delivery and installation of both. Made sure both had updated outlets/connections and that there was a clear path to both locations in the kitchen.On the day of delivery, our confirmed 4-hour time slot came and went. We received no notification that the truck was 1/2 hour away so when it arrived an hour late, we had to rush to clear the old fridge of food. The two delivery men were not friendly and quite frankly seemed to hate their jobs. No apology for the lack of communication or missing the delivery window, despite the fact that I took a day off of work to wait for them. They rolled the fridge into the kitchen, peeled the protective layers off the front, but then left greasy fingerprints all over the doors. They did not level the fridge, connect it, test the functions, and they refused to answer connection questions. I ordered the upgraded braided water line in the store and I had to ask them for it three times before they threw the cheap plastic line at me with a grunt.For the microwave with the CONFIRMED installation scheduled, the delivery men dropped the box in the middle of the kitchen floor. They did not uncrate, set up, test, inspect for damage, or discard the packing materials as outlined in the basic installation agreement. They refused to help with installation or answer any questions about it. Honestly, it was abundantly clear that they had no intention on helping us and that they couldn't leave fast enough. Thanks for nothing.Next day, called Home Depot to request a refund on the incorrect water line and report the abysmal delivery and lack of installation. Home Depot customer service put me on hold several times trying to reach the 3rd party delivery service (didn't catch the company name or I would be blasting them on social media, too). Waited about a half hour just for them to suggest that they could drop off the correct water line I already purchased in TWO WEEKS. When I told Home Depot that was unacceptable, I was put on hold again. HD Customer Service assured me that I would receive a credit for the incorrect water line but if it was not satisfactory, I would have to take it up with the retail location I ordered from. I fully expect this fight to continue for a while.As a previous reviewer stated, ""If you want it done right, do it yourself.""Home Depot, don't advertise that you provide free home delivery and installation if you don't.Sincerely,A Disgruntled Home Depot customer who now shops exclusively at Lowe's",0,1

The Home Depot,Don't buy extended warranties.,"I jus wanted to say I'm a regular almost daily shopper at home depot. I buy a lot of top of the equipment from them and pay for extended warranties and all of it. But i have come to realize that it is nothin but a inconvenience and a nightmare dealing with anybody with the home depot management and the manufacturer. I have had my equipment less than a year and took a echo weed eater and a ego lithium hedge trimmer in. Had receipts and everything but b4 I could explain management is already treating me like I'm trying to scam them or something. I jus want my equipment to b fixed. They tell me to call manufacture and the manufacturer is telling me to call home depot. Then 8 got to drive the equipment to a home depot rental location which is another 45min away. Then pay 20$ for each piece of equipment to b diagnosed.they ask in the paperwork how much u would like to cover if it's not under warranty before they call u if it's more. Well I say 100. I had my weed eater for 4months and hadnproble s since I opened the box . So when they called for it to b picked up ,guess how much I had to pay. 97.78$ . What a coincidence. They had to replace the whole carburetor!!!!!! Come on it was only 4 months old and only used 3×. Now my hedge trimmers they said takes anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. Well they couldn't fix in shop so they had to send it out to what I thought was the manufacturer and said it will b 4 to 6weeks now. Well I'm go in on 2 months and been calling to check on status . Well they sent it to another home depot service somewhere and are waiting on a part. So are u serious now I'm waiting even longer for a part. Why would u send it there without them even having the parts to fix it. . U could've kept here and have ordered the part delivered here to fix it. So i got my HOA on me bout my bushes so what am I to do. .???? I asked so how bout y'all rent me y'alls hedge trimmers till I get mine back and of course they can't do that. At this point I'm really dissapointed and think, when is it time for yall jus to replace it. And give me another one. So to anyone who is thinking bout getting extended warranty (DONT)!!!! And now I SIT and wait to who knows how long till I get it. This is ridiculous.",0,1

The Home Depot,"ROCKFORD,  IL","Was at the store, because I was not happy about the store not having a item in stock which they had stocked in the past, I had voiced my opinion. Well a store employee decided to say a loud to another person that maybe I should go to Lowes or Menards very rudely. I was caught off guard at such an attitude by a store employee. Seems like we can't voice our opinions at Home Depot with out being told to go somewhere else. That is what I did, and bought a $950 tile saw somewhere else.

She was so good that I decided I will now purchase my granite counter tops from Home Depot and more specifically from her even if they cost more than the company I was originally going to use.So to be clear she treated me so well that I will not price compare on my future purchases that involve her and her department.Thank you Shelly!",0,5

The Home Depot,Problems with kitchen refacing project:,"Problems with kitchen refacing project:We ordered a kitchen refacing and countertop/sink install from Home Depot on May 14th from store 3206 in Papillion, Nebraska. We were told we would have the install done the week of June 19-23. We told the salesperson we would be out of town on June 11-14. This is written on the document we signed. When we returned from our trip supplies for our sink install had been left on our doorstep in our absence. Luckily it was all there. We then assumed we were on track for installation, but that didn't happen. We heard nothing from anyone about the install. We even went down to the Home Depot store in Papillion and inquired but they had no knowledge. Finally the refacing guy came to measure. He gave us the spiel as if we were new customers who hadn't already ordered the work. We were told to buy a range hood in our initial meeting with the salesperson and it would be installed. The refacing guy suggested we have a friend install it to save us money. He eventually agreed to install it. He now said the install would be the week of July 9th. Then we heard nothing. Every time we have had anything done it is because my husband called to get the ball rolling. The countertop guy showed up June 22 to measure and was annoyed that we were told that the work was to be done June 19-23 originally. He was also unclear as to what was happening with the plumbing. He suggested a friend could disconnect the sink to save us money. He was unclear of how he was to be paid. (This after Home Depot insisted we pay the entire $12,700 up front). After he left we again heard nothing. My daughter had planned to come and visit this summer after the work was done in our kitchen, but since we never really knew when that was ever going to happen, she didn't come. My husband finally called again and miracle of miracles a firm day was set for August 1...except the plumber actually came on July 31st (we were notified of this the day before) making me have to rearrange my schedule. And once again the plumber was unsure of the extent of what he was supposed to do (as were we). The countertops were installed, and the plumbers returned to install our reverse osmosis water filter which we had ask for in the initial order. We had requested in that order that we did not want a sprayer and that the spigot for the water filter should be installed in that hole instead. While I wasn't watching the sprayer was installed. Luckily my husband noticed before an additional hole was put in the sink. I am assuming the information about the sprayer never reached the plumber. The cabinets are now installed and are beautiful on the outside. However, the salesperson had told us that the interiors of the cabinets would all be fitted with new shelves and hardware. This did not happen. Misinformation? I don't know, but that seems to be a common thread here. My husband ended up removing the shoddily installed vertical cabinet dividers and reinstalling them himself.The refacing guy did apologize for the delay in the install but said it was because the supplies hadn't arrived. When I looked at his boxes of supplies that he left yesterday evening, I noted the that the shipping date on the boxes was June 18...Hmmm....I like the exterior of the cabinets and the countertops, but this entire process has been stressful and inconvenient. I would never recommend anyone go with Home Depot to do a project of this sort.When I contacted Home Depot Customer Care they told me they couldn’t talk to me because the contract was in my husband’s name. But the paper I signed was in BOTH of our names. Good way to get the unhappy woman off the phone and how incredibly offensive!",0,2
The Home Depot,Worst washer/dryer delivery experience,"This is the worst service I've ever experience. They promised to call the day before delivery day but they never called, and automatically reschedule it for us. And of course they did not call again the day before the second delivery day. We had to call to check on the status. They can not give a specific time on the delivery until 30 mins before they arrive, this makes it difficult to reserve service elevator as i am living in a condo with many families sharing an service elevator. They have a 15 mins waiting policy, which is very unsustainable. By waiting for a few more minutes it will save them another trip and also save customer lots of trouble. This is a very bad system. Needs substantial improvement. And wasting everybody's time.",0,1
The Home Depot,appliances and delivery,"I bought 4 appliances from the home depot 3 weeks ago. They agreed to deliver, install 3 of them and remove the old appliances for free (so to speak). When the truck arrived, he claimed he had no legal place to park, although he could have parked 50' from my condo's garage door at a neighboring business. It was Saturday so the space was empty. My choice was to return the appliances and re-schedule delivery or they would drop them in my parking space in the garage. I agreed to have them left in my parking space because my family had driven 170 miles to help me install the dishwasher and we had already disconnected the old appliances. I feel I was mislead by the salesman who sold me the appliances. He knew I lived on the 4th floor of a condominium and still did not mention the need for a delivery plan or fill out the proper form. My family and I spent all day installing them. We had to buy a $60 hand truck to get them up to my unit. When my sister and I went in a talked to the appliance supervisor at the store, there was no apology or 'how can we help'. I'm not sure what they were doing, really, just looking at the order. They did say they would 'talk' to the salesman and let him know that he f##!!ed up. We insisted on some money back and they gave us a $100, a grossly inadequate compensation for our time, effort and expense. I had to call the store 4 times to finally get someone out to my condo to pick up the old appliances that were littering up my parking space in the parking garage. It's against the rules of the condo to have junk in a parking space so I had to placate the condo association for 4 days. I'm not sure who was more negligent, the salesman or the delivery drivers. I will never buy another thing from the home depot and I've been shopping there for years.",0,1
The Home Depot,Poor Customer Service,"On June 26 2018, I purchased a range and microwave from Home Depot. I was told appliances would be delivered in a little over 4 weeks. I told the sales person that this would be fine although it was imperative that delivery be on a Friday as it is my only day off from work. PROBLEM #1: The delivery date was set for Thursday, July 26. As soon as I realized that delivery was scheduled for a Thursday instead of a Friday as I requested, I changed the delivery date to July 27. I was told that the appliances would be delivered between 11am and 3 pm. PROBLEM #2: On Friday, July 27, shortly before 3 pm, I received a call from the delivery company, (GE Delivery) that they would arrive in 15-30 minutes. Fifteen minutes later the delivery person called back to ask if I had heard from Home Depot regarding the delivery. I said no and was told that the appliance never made it on the truck as it was lost in the warehouse. PROBLEM #3: HOME DEPOT NEVER CONTACTED ME. In fact, no one other than the delivery man called me. My next call was to Home Depot Customer Service, who transferred me to the delivery company. They were less than helpful and explained it would take at least 4 days to find the lost appliance. It was implied that this is a common occurrence at the warehouse, which does explain their lack of concern. The Home Depot customer service person suggested that I contact the store where I bought the appliances, which I did. The appliance manager called me back to say the range was lost in the warehouse and Home Depot or GE Delivery would be contacting me. There was no offer to monitor this. He just provided information that I already knew. Again, I HEARD NOTHING from either Home Depot or the GE Delivery.PROBLEM #4: On Monday, I called HOME DEPOT Customer Service again and spoke with a young lady who did not transfer me to the deliver company. She was understanding and showed a willingness to help me out. I was told that I would be receiving a $75 gift card for my inconvenience. I was also told that there would be compensation from the delivery company as well. Neither of these things ever materialized. The only compensation I asked for was that, when the delivery was made, that it be early as I had to rearrange other commitments. PROBLEM #5: On Thursday, August 2, I received an automated message at 6:00 pm that the delivery would be on Friday, August 3 between 11 am and 3 pm, so my request for early delivery or a smaller window was ignored. I think it is important to note that this is the third time I have had problems with purchases at Home Depot so I had my reservations about buying the appliances there. I have recently replaced all of my other appliances from Lowes and had no problems whatsoever. However, Home Depot’s price was significantly lower. In light of the inconvenience (and aggravation), I can say with 100% assurance, I will not make this mistake again. In fact, it is highly unlikely I will shop there again. The other thing to note is that Home Depot had use of my money for 5 weeks, which, although a common occurrence, is unacceptable in my opinion.",0,1

The Home Depot,Buying Thomasville Cabinets from Home…,"Buying Thomasville Cabinets from Home Depot has been a nightmare! Never have I been so disappointed in a product, Manufacture Rep, Medic sent out by MasterBrand's and H.D. Manager. I thought I was buying one of the best cabinets on the market for the money, boy was I wrong! The finish is thin and blotchy and there are even parts of raw wood exposed. After Thomasville sent out numerous replacements doors, on the 3rd installation attempt, the Medic put the 1st (original) doors back on and said that the best he can do. According to the Thomasville Rep and Medic, Maple wood used in cabinets will not absorb stain evenly. So, they CAN NOT produce the finish as displayed and ordered. If that's the case, how can they sell this product? More importantly, why wasn't it disclosed when ordering? H.D. and Thomasville are taking the position, my daughter and I should be satisfied, we knew going in it would be a substandard finish. The H.D Manager actually suggested my daughter and I knowingly ordered thin/blotchy finish and now we are having buyer’s remorse. THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE ATTITUDE BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF HOME DEPOT ESPECIALLY A MANAGER!!!! After showing the H.D Manager the pictures for the 2nd time, he glanced at them and said, it looks fine to him. Interesting Note: the Medic and I both checked multiple H.D. stores and it looks like the original samples of Graphite finish on Maple wood were taken off the display racks. HUMMMMM?????Now, H.D. and Thomasville are offering an INSULTING cash settlement plus stain just so I'll go away. Their position is I can hire a Carpenter to sand the doors down, restain and vanish them. This is totally unacceptable! I JUST WANT AN EVEN STAIN ON MY CABINETS AS SHOWN ON THE STORE SAMPLE AT THE TIME OF ORDERING!!! The H.D. Manager said he would contact the Thomasville Rep to see if he can get a product sample for comparison. Hopefully, it will be the ORIGINAL SAMPLE",0,1

The Home Depot,"If there was such thing as a “negative-star rating,” I would chose it","If there was such thing as a “negative-star rating,” I would have chosen that. My experience with purchasing a washing machine with Home Depot has been horrendous. I purchased a washing machine on July 15th and had my delivery set for the 20th. Due to personal issues, I rescheduled my delivery date to the 25th. After taking work off, I waited for my delivery, which was scheduled between 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM. At 4:30, I still had not received a call from the delivery company with any update, so I called the number of the service, which was Appliance Home Delivery. I explained my current situation to woman #1, and was told that the driver was running late and there were a few deliveries before me, so to wait 30-40 minutes to hear back from the delivery driver, and if I do not hear back in an hour, to call her back and they would figure out what was going on. An hour passed, so I called the company back, where I was put on with woman #2. I explained the situation to her, and again was told the same thing that woman #1 told me. I explained to her that was the same response I received previously and that there must be something wrong. At this point, it is 6:30 PM, so I requested for the delivery to be rescheduled first thing the next morning. She replied, “We don’t do next day delivery, the next day we have available would be the July 31st.” She responded as if I had originally requested to push the delivery even further out than it was, without acknowledging there was clearly a problem on the company’s behalf!! I responded saying that was unacceptable and that the company is responsible for fixing their issue with this delivery. So she puts me on hold to see what is actually going on. A half hour later, woman #3 gets on the phone and begins with, “Hi this is X how may I help you?” Woman #2 completely disregarded our problem and passed my call onto another person who had no knowledge of the current matter! Again, I explained what has happened up to her answering my call, and she was the first to apologize, then said she would contact the delivery driver and see what was going on. After being on hold again, she says that there is a “red line through my order number” and that the delivery driver says that the machine is not on his truck. So without my knowledge, this washing machine was not going to be delivered on that day anyways! When I asked how could this have possibly happened, she said she would contact me the following day to see where my washer is. I said ok fine. The next day, I still did not receive a call, so I decided to call during the late afternoon. I get on the phone with woman # 4, AGAIN, explain everything up until her, and after being put on hold, she says that the washing machine is basically missing and that they need to check the warehouse to see if they have it in stock.... How could the washing machine not be in stock if it was originally supposed to be delivered last week?!? Her response was clueless and she said I would receive another call that evening after they get in touch with the warehouse. Considering I am at work during this whole situation, I missed the call that evening, and they left a message stating that the delivery can not be done until the 31st because they are all booked up. Okay, so I understand that they are booked up, but as a customer who is currently washerless and has been put through the wringer, you are not going to do whatever you can to have my order be the first one out?!? That is absolute nonsense!! Since I could not get in contact with them that night, I called the next morning (today), and spoke to woman #5, and once again, explained the whole situation up to her, and after being put on hold, I was hung up on!!! I waited 10 minutes to call back incase it was a mistake and was seeing if I was going to get a call back, and to no surprise, there was none. I called the place back and now with woman #6, explained the whole ordeal, and in the nastiest tone, this woman said that there was nothing she could do and that it would be delivered on the 31st. With me being upset, I expressed my disappointment with this company and was trying to get a legitimate answer as to why this happened and why they were not trying to make this situation right. Her response was, “We are completely booked and we cannot knock off another person from our list just to get yours in. Would you like for us to schedule yours later in the week or do you want to accept the 31st?” ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Never in my entire life have I ever experienced such poor and disgusting customer service from a person. I was basically told, you either accept this date or else we are going to give you an even later one. After literally being speechless from that comment, she proceeds to say, “Thank you for calling Appliance Home Delivery, have a great day,” and hung up before I could get a word in. At this point I am shaking with anger and frustration, so I call again, and get woman #7, and immediately requested for this call to be transferred to a supervisor. Woman #8, the supervisor gets on the phone, and like the 7 other times before, I explain the situation. She says that no request for complaint or compensation can be made until after the washing machine has been delivered. So there was no way for me to even decide if I wanted to return this machine prior to the arrival, as that would depend on what compensation, if any can be made at all. This woman then tells me that her company is a 3rd party and that they don’t have control over what goes on, that it is the delivery company where I should be having the complaint given to, but could not give me the name of the delivery company. She suggested I call Home Depot and take it up with them. So after talking to all of those people about this issue, there was no resolution whatsoever. I called Home Depot and as of now, are waiting to hear back to see what can be done, which I will give and update to this post when I find out. After this experience so far, I am so disappointed and disgusted with the service, or lack thereof, that I have received. If you have read through this whole post, I want to first thank you, and second, hope that you have changed your mind about buying ANYTHING from Home Depot. Although this delivery is not a Home Depot company, I think that it speaks volumes about Home Depot and their inability to provide anything less than an excellent customer experience.

I purchased a new dishwasher from Leon's Which was in stock FREE delivery. after the 11th day I received a refund from Paypal (home depot did NOT contact them back about my dispute).

The Home Depot,Home Depot does not value their customers.,"I made a purchase from homedepot.com in May and June. I was shorted on the flooring I bought on my first order and now I can't find that flooring so my floor is unfinished. I purchased a new new set of kitchen appliances in June. I had a horrible experience with the delivery service they used. There were several mix ups and as a result I spent almost 10 hours on the phone with their customer service. I asked what they would do for me as a result of my experience. They gave me a $50 HD gift card. That was something but it meant that I had to shop at HD again, and it also suggested that my time was only worth less than $5 an hour to them. I then had to deal with them again because they didn't give me the credits I was supposed to receive. I spoke to 3 different people, all of which wanted to argue and told me what I saw on my bill wasn't what I was seeing. I had to take a picture and send it to them before they agreed that I saw the info on my bill correctly! I messaged them on their Facebook page twice and no one replied to help. I will NEVER shop there again. Not to mention I have never had anyone help or ask if I needed help in the store. I usually encounter rude employees and a long wait to check out or get help at the service desk. Home Depot is not customer centric. In fact, they make you feel like they don't want your business.",0,1
The Home Depot,Working floor employes don't care about customers.,"This review has to do with the Home Depot located in Aurora, CO off of Mississippi Ave and I-225: The customer service (CS) is questionable but the working staff on the floor are definitely incompetent and not customer oriented. After asking CS to have someone help me unload 17 16-foot lap siding off of my pickup, I ended up waiting at least 30 minutes for help. CS first announced my request but no one came to help. There were two employees standing about 50 feet from my pickup shooting the breeze. Whenever I motioned to them to help me, they turned away in the other direction. They soon disappeared, so I went back to CS, but no one was there. I went back to my pickup and ended up unloading the siding myself which took another 30 minutes. After unloading, an employee came up to me and told me (not asked me) to move my truck so he could load a pallet onto another truck. I said I need to have someone sign this receipt off to prove that I dropped the siding off. He said he wouldn't and that I had to go back to customer service. I replied that I will not move my truck then until someone signs this off. Finally I found someone else to sign off, but something that could have taken a mere five minutes took longer than an hour to drop off the siding. Terrible employee/customer relationship.",0,1

The Home Depot,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM Home Depot!!!!!!!!! We ordered 2 refrigerators from Home Depot through their 800 number, because the website was having problems. I verified on the phone that it will be delivered Saturday the 14th. On the 13, I found out I needed to host a business dinner, so instead of just relying on the automated system, on the 13th, at around 1 pm, I called to verify that it would be there Saturday, which Home Depot confirmed and gave me the number to text in case I have further questions. At around 2 pm, I decided to check again, just to have it in writing. At 2:59 pm, George, the Home Depot representative assured me that they had double checked and it would be delivered as promised ""Yes Sophia! I just checked and I see that it's scheduled for delivery tomorrow between 9:30-1:30! 😃”. I asked the agent to triple check, because I needed to make sure and the answer was ""It has been confirmed! 😀 You’re welcome! Thank you for texting The Home Depot! If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to text us anytime. Please take a moment to complete our one question survey. Have a marvelous evening! :)”Just to be absolutely sure, because it was so important, figured that if I text around 9 pm, I will be assured that the information is accurate. I was promised, in writing, that the 9:30-1:30 was confirmed.On Saturday, at around 11 am, I text to see where they were to see how long it would be. I had already had movers move my furniture and had everything out of the old refrigerator which was not working. I was anxious, because I needed to buy more stuff and start preparing for the evening dinner. Again, I was assured they would be there by 1:30 by Michelle, another Home Depot representative. When I asked for them to please call the driver to see how close they were, one hour later, they finally told me that it would not be delivered. Their mistake oops. I obviously panicked and explained my situation asking for a manager or someone to get involved to help me get my refrigerators. A representative, Kathy from customer resolutions, called me to assure me that Home Depot would get this resolved and the appliance manager, Robert, would call me from the Sunset store. I also have that entire conversation, where Robert basically said they could not help me unless I wanted them to bring a loaner fridge and move my furniture and food two more times so I could pay furniture movers again. When the store manager, Esmirelda called me back 3 hours later after I text again, she said they were willing to loan me a 10 cu ft refrigerator (instead of the 2 20something cu ft refrigerators that I ordered. They both said they would do NOTHING ELSE and the refrigerators I actually ordered would not be delivered till the 19th!!!!!!! EVEN T?HOUGH IT WAS THEIR MISTAKE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THEY WOUDL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! NOTHING TO FIX THE ISSU!!!WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM Home Depot!!!!!!!!!",0,1
The Home Depot,Home Depot delivery/hookup of new appliance,"Home Depot delivered my new LG washer. According to the papers given me at the time of purchase they would hook up the new washer and test it to make sure it worked properly and remove the old washer. When they tried to put my drain hose in they broke another drain pipe. Even though I noticed water on the pipe and pointed it out they would not talk. Then my old washer was not removed (as I had paid for) because I was not told the pedestal had to be removed first. When I called home appliance dept. they do not answer their phone so I tried the customer service line and that person told me they have a lot of problems with delivery. I won' purchase another appliance from Home Depot. I decided not to walk away mad and finally spoke to a supervisor. She was very helpful. She was aware of multiple complaints about their delivery company, as is corporate and they are taking action. I was refunded enough to cover my expenses for the broken pipe and an appointment was set up for my old washer to picked up. I changed my rating from 1 to 5 stars because of the excellent customer service.",0,5

I had a Whirlpool refrigerator delivered & installed over 2mths ago. The 2 men tried squeezing it through my kitchen doorway until they finally decided to take off the refrigerator doors at which time, it slid through. I did not see the small amount of damage till that evening & the next day made a claim. Here it is almost 3mths later, numerous calls & even going & personally speaking to the store mgr at Home Depot & the delivery company has denied my claim saying my refrigerator was never installed because I didn't have a water valve on the wall behind my refrigerator so they left it in my house still in the box.

The Home Depot,Deceptive and Misleading,"Purchased 2 dishwashers from Home Depot online 7/6/18 for delivery and install 7/12/18 in the morning. All communication on the order stated ""delivery AND install"" scheduled for 7/12/18. On 7/10/18 I receive a call confirming the delivery day and time and find out FOR THE FIRST TIME that there is a 2 step delivery and install process. That one company delivers the appliances, but another company has to call me and arrange an install time. NOWHERE on the order, nor the confirmation does it say this. We bought the appliances for our home which we are actively selling. We have an open house scheduled for 7/14/18. I chose Home depot over a competitor specifically because their delivery and install could be done before our open house. Now I have to deal with having two large dishwashers just sitting in the kitchen or on the front porch for an undetermined amount of time until some unknown 3rd party provider decides to call me to arrange yet another undetermined day in future to come out and remove the old dishwashers and install the new ones. I've spent two days online and on the phone calling customer service and No one at home depot can/will give me the contact information for this unknown installer so I can contact them directly to get an install date. I know for a fact that contractors/plumbers/electricians are busy and often can't book for weeks. All home depot staff have done is blame other departments for misleading/incorrect information I've been given, and assure me that someone will call me within 24 hours of the appliances being delivered. If I had this process information beforehand, I would NEVER have ordered our appliances from them. BE ASSURED HOME DEPOT, I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM YOU AGAIN. And I WILL tell anyone and everyone who asks to never buy from you either.",0,1
The Home Depot,Unethical business practices,"They were selling composite decking in the Niagara Falls store. I purchased the decking for a project but later found after I purchased it I would have to special order the starter deck boards in the store. I Went back to the store 3 times in order to place the order. The special orders desk clerk told me I would have to go to lumber department to place a special order and she would send someone right over. I waited a half hour and nobody came. I went back to the Special Order desk and was told she was sorry. I said this is the special order desk....please place my order. On third trip to this store I was told that the starter deck boards were discontinued and were no longer available. I asked why do you continue to sell deck boards for projects that cannot be completed? I believe this particular store has a very unethical business practice. I will be returning all the decking I purchased. Once again loading a trailer and multiple visits and hours of my time trying to support this local store. I will never set foot in this store again. In my business, I deal with homeowners and the trades on a daily basis. I will be telling this story to my clients and any one else who will listen and advise them not to deal with this Home Depot location.",0,1

The Home Depot,"DO NOT COME HERE FOR THEIR ""PROFESSIONAL"" SERVICES","This is what they did to my door and left it hanging that way for over a month. Just look at the pictures. I PAID ALMOST $1800, for this? Not to mention the 3 days I had to take off work so far. I originally ordered a door from Home Depot on 4/26/2018 YES APRIL 26TH!! THE DOOR IS STILL NOT HERE! Then door came and when half way through demolishing the old frame they realized that the new door was the wrong size. Look at the pictures. Yes those are cuts on both sides of the frame and into the stucco. THEY WERE CUTTING MY OLD FRAME WITH A JIGSAW WHEN THEY REALIZED THIS! Their answer was to just throw a bunch of screws in the frame and call it good and left. After this I received no response or updates UNTIL I CALLED THEM COMPLAINING! There are clear holes to the outside from THE FRAME of the door and the door itself is only held on by a couple screws. Numerous calls and all I get is ""well we can have someone come by and put MORE screw in the frame and the ""expedited"" order is taking over a month. It’s taken longer than the original door did?!?! That is not expedited. This would be OK if it were a door inside my house. BUT THIS IS MY FRONT DOOR. LITERALLY THE ONLY THING KEEPING MY FAMILY SAFE FROM INTRUDERS WHEN I'M NOT HOME! I HAVE A WIFE A KID AND DOGS! If someone wanted to get through my door in the condition it is in I'm sure they would have no problem and I’m supposed to be ok with this? I'm really upset how all of this was handled. No updates and seemingly no care or concern for how my house is doing. I will never come to home depot for work again. I am 100% certain that this would be completely unacceptable in their homes but its fine for mine to be like this I guess. I advise everyone to stay away. Get someone who actually cares to do the work for you.",0,1

I get a call from the office saying the drivers are 10 minutes away; however the drivers never arrived. You would think I would have been getting a delivery, or at least a call first thing the next morning but instead I'm calling customer service with no one able to do anything but send emails. This is absolutely unprofessional service that a company such as Home Depot can't get your Appliance delivered during the time window and doesn't at least follow up with their customers to make sure that they their problem is resolved immediately. You all definitely should have vendors that are local, and that take pride in working because obviously your drivers do not!!",0,1
The Home Depot,Where's my vanity top?!,"My aggravating experience was with the customer service/delivery department at the Home Depot in Riverhead. I decided to remodel my small half bathroom. So, this past May, I ordered and paid for all the essentials-- a toilet, medicine cabinet, tiles, vanity and vanity top (sink top). I informed them that my contractor would come to pick up the order around June 11 (or that week). He went to pick everything up on June 14, but the vanity top was not there. What happened to it? It was there in the store when I picked it out. They never told me that it wasn't there. So, I went back to pick out a new similar vanity top. The one I had originally ordered and paid for was not in stock. The new vanity top that they helped me pick out turned out to be the wrong size. At this point, the contractor had already drilled holes and installed the vanity. So, a representative helped me to order the vanity top I needed online express delivery apparently from a Home Depot in Conn. I placed the order on June 18 and it was supposed to be delivered to my home on June 23. Well, June 23 came and all I got was a phone message, ""unfortunately, your order is outside our route, so you won't be expecting the delivery."" It would have been nice to know that when I placed the order, but as the manager explained to me, ""the delivery drivers don't pull up the orders until the day of delivery, and they didn't realize how far a drive it would be."" Finally, I went to LOWES and found the vanity top I needed. Why didn't I think of that earlier?",0,1

The Home Depot,Home Depot Appliance delivery and install,"This review is about Home Depot and not about the washer and dryer I purchased. Be Careful about your expectations with the Home Depot Installers. We wanted the washer installed but had to install the dryer ourselves because apparently everything has to be perfect for the install. Well, the home depot installers seemed to do what they can to actually avoid installing the washer. All they wanted to do was to deliver the product. Very disappointing. Almost had them come back and pick it up for a return. Even the guy in the plumbing department (when we were buying stuff to install the dryer) told us this was a problem with the home depot installers. All because we bought an extension to the drain hose (by the way, apparently you can buy with the washer with a longer drain hose but our sales person did not know this and SOLD US THE EXTENSION that was suppose to be installed. Never had a problem with LOWES or Sergeant Appliance. Prices are very similar - will never buy an appliance from Home Depot again - lesson learned.",0,1

I speak to a different rep who I explained what happened with the previous rep and she started doing the same thing. I couldn't get a word in and when I did she said that ""you said the previous rep was talking over you and when I talk you are doing the same thing"" She was simply relaying details that were not even addressing the entire complaint. I then kept trying to ask about Kevin and said that I simply have a question. I said that Kevin has not called. She said ""that is not a question that is a statement"" She became agitated saying ""I can message Kevin to call you is that what you want me to do"" I said yes. She sounded so crazy it was unbelievable. I then call back and had to ask for a supervisor and they put me through to someone at corporate. I explained everything and she seemed to understand the part of the complaint that was not addressed, then she said that she will message Kevin to call.

I went online and re-ordered the rest of items from different location, they charged my credit card but they called and told me they dont have the items in the store since their inventory not updated for on-line purchasing !! they told me it will take 4-5 business days to get my money back, I re-ordred the same items from different location wtih assist of an agent. This morning the driver dlivered the wrong color itmes and left them in my driveway. I contacnted the agent again, told me they have my itmes at different location and I have to call their ""Pro speicalist "" to re-order the items. Three charged for same order and still don't have the right item, neither my money. Stay away form Home Depot , they have the worst coustomer service. Specially on-line.",0,1
The Home Depot,Refrigerator delivery issues - Home Depot rejects my online review,"Home Depot rejected my product review, because it included a review of their delivery procedures. How else would customers get honest feedback of the purchase and delivery experience?REVIEW:Big freezer, so you have to lean over to look into the the lower compartment. I hoped that this new fridge would be less noisy, compared to my 33 year old Whirlpool. It's not. Significant amount of hissing and gurgling. Overall the fridge looks nice, but the plastic handles look and feel cheap. Seems like the lower door should have 1 more adjustable shelf. It has 3, but 4 would be better.I have to give Home Depot a POOR rating for the online delivery. During the online chat, and on a phone call, I specifically stated that I needed a LEFT hand door. I was told that the fridge would arrive with the doors off and that the delivery people could assemble it with the door hinges on either side.The delivery man did not ask me about door positions, and brought the fridge into my house assembled with the door hinges on the wrong side! I noticed grease and metal flakes from the assembly. I decided not to have them remove and reassemble the doors, so I did it myself.After rearranging the doors I noticed that the fridge was rocking. The delivery guy had not offered to balance the fridge. I adjusted the screws and balanced the fridge myself.I think that most customers, that are not mechanically inclined, would be quite disappointed with a fridge that is not assembled to specification, and not balanced.",0,2
The Home Depot,It's obvious Home Depot does not care…,"It's obvious Home Depot does not care about its customers.I bought a Samsung 22.6 cu. ft. 4-Door French Door Refrigerator It's pretty but that's about it. The shelves and door shelves are way too small for regular sized items.Also, no where on the website does it tell you that you actually need a space that is 40 inches wide so you can open the doors. I did not learn this until after they dropped it off (in the middle of my kitchen) and left. They did not unpack it or push it into its location, so I was unpleasantly surprised after I took off all the wrapping, figured out how to install the shelves, pushed it back into position and couldn't open the doors. I called Home Depot within an hour of the fridge being dropped off and they told me they would not take it back and there is nothing I can do about it.Now I'm out $3,000 and have a fridge in the middle of my kitchen. The only hope I have of making it fit is to either tear out a wall or tear my upper cabinets off and cut my granite counter top by 3 inches. Thanks for nothing Home Depot",0,1

The Home Depot,They want all your ID info for a store credit,"We purchased a ""smart"" lightbulb which didn't work. It was about $25. We returned it to Home Depot in Warrington PA. Since we didn't have the receipt, they said they could give us a store credit, which was fine with us. Then they asked to see a driver's license, which we objected to. They actually lied saying it was a Visa policy that they have to see a driver's license to give us a store credit. We checked with Visa and they denied that it is their policy; in fact, they advise cardholders like us NOT to provide any further form of ID in order to prevent identity theft. Home Depot continued to refuse to give a store credit, this time saying it was Home Depot's policy. A couple of years ago, identity info which Home Depot had on file was stolen when their system was hacked and it caused us much inconvenience re: issuance of new credit card etc.In spite of that, they continue to insist that we must show driver's license or some state ID. Both have full identifying info. So we are stuck with a very expensive smart lightbulb that doesn't work. Beware of losing your Home Depot receipts!",0,1

The Home Depot,DO NOT USE HOME DEPOT IN HOME SERVICES…,"DO NOT USE HOME DEPOT IN HOME SERVICES for your remodeling projects. In January of this year we began a kitchen remodeling project. We decided to use Home Depot for the project because we were told that they would manage all aspects of the project and stand behind the work of their individual contractors. The initial refacing of the cabinets went well except for a couple doors which were put on opening the wrong way and some missing molding. The doors were corrected. The appliances were delivered and installed with no problems. When the tech came to measure for the countertops, we were told that the new counters would be approx. ¼ inch higher than the old ones. This was not a problem. However, when the countertops were installed they were actually 1 1/2 inches higher that the old ones. This left the stove and dishwasher looking like they were sitting in a hole. When HD was informed of the problem, they promised to fix it. The tech came out and fixed the problem with the dishwasher but was not prepared to do the stove. Now three months after starting this project, we still do not have resolution on the stove and missing molding. We are quite disappointed in HD’s lack of response and would not recommend using their services as a result. The cabinets and the appliances look great, but the countertop problem has spoiled the whole project. Had HD delivered on their promises we would have given them a good recommendation, but lack of followup has soured us on their services. See the pictures below to see how HD has left this project hanging for two months.",0,2

The Home Depot,Deciectful untrustworthy and unprofessional,"Today, 07 March 2018 I was in Home Depot and was looking at the Black Friday spring sales on the DeWalt still driver and impact with 2 batteries and a charger as well as the Milwaukee set of the same caliber. On the sign in the store it states the value is $268 for $159. I decided to go on to the website and look at what they had on the website. It stated that the original price was $169 marked down to $159. I asked for the manager at the time and was extremely rude. Him and one other guy that was with him both persistently argued and argued with me in the store in front of everyone saying that the one in store is a better deal comes with batteries and charger. I told him that I have it pulled up on my phone and showed him it was exactly the same thing model number DCK240C2 Dewalt 20-V Lithium-ion cordless drill driver and impact combo kit (2 tool) with (2) Batteries 1.3 ah charger and case. He continued to argue.I also stated that if it were the same kit just the 2.0ah As opposed to the 1.3ah that is different cause the 2.0 is actually valued at 268 and instead of even trying to resolve the situation he just walked off and was a complete ** about it. I then left and called customer service and explained everything to her. She looked it up online and said yes I was correct. Plus it’s the only DeWalt on sale. It was same with Milwaukee I told her. She stated that it has nothing to do with them setting prices that it has to do with marketing. I asked well. I would like someone from marketing to get a hold of e and she stated no one from marketing will ever get a hold of customer. I stated ** at that point since no one will get a hold of me from marketing or higher executive that I would send this complaint to the Better Business Bureau.

The Home Depot,Rating is based on my satisfaction with poor customer service,"Rating is based on my satisfaction with Home Depot and not the product itself, as of this review the unit has been installed but not yet tested however I am very happy with Symmons customer service as you will read below and is why I would recommend Symmons. The unit arrived missing the 2 dome covers for the diverter and mixing valves which wasnt discovered until the uit was installed. Upon contacting Home Depot to get the issue resolved I was told that I would have to return the unit and get a replacement, when I told the genius in HD customer service that it was already installed, I was told that I was essentially out of luck. Well you know who is out of luck HD, you, you lost a customer and I will be closing my charge account, I will try my luck at the local HW stores and your competitors. I dont mind paying a bit more for quality products and superior customer service.I called Symmons and explained the problem to them and in less than 10 minutes I had an order number for the replacement parts they were going to ship out. I have installed Symmons in both of our bathrooms and am very happy with the way they handled this for me. I was forced to leave this true and accurate account of my experience on external sites because HD likes to censor and reject reviews critical of their poor performance and products.Bye Bye Home Creepo!",0,1
The Home Depot,bad experience with Home Depot,"We had a terrible experience, purchasing our new refrigerator. It was with the delivery.I set up a delivery date. It was supposed to be last Wednesday, March 14th. Well, on the morning of the 13th, I had an email in my inbox telling me that the refrigerator was being delivered that day- Tuesday, not Wednesday. The company had simply decided to change the delivery date without discussing it with me. This was awful , because I had wanted a Wednesday specifically because I do not work on Wednesdays and could easily arrange to be home. I quickly set about canceling and moving things. I emailed the supervisor and told him that i would be late . I was caught, because I had arranged for the old fridge to be picked up, on Thursday, and didn't want to call to tell them I couldn't stay home for this delivery, since it might mean i would have my delivery bounced to after the old fridge was picked up- leaving me refridgerator-less.Well, around 3:45 PM, I finally get an (automated) call from the delivery service. They will be delivering it, TOMORROW ( the originally scheduled date) between 1 and 5 PM.So, now, I had frantically rearranged everything for no reason...well, except that I had moved an appointment into the ""new"" delivery window and was going to have to call and reschedule that , again.I called them. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told that management was in a meeting, but that I would be called back. I was, but the response of the supervisor was that eh gets wrong emails from the headquarters all the time, and that it was no big deal.I told him that it was NOT okay to treat customers this way, regardless of the internal communications problems their company has. I told him that he needed to look into what went wrong and call me back, which he did not do.This has left a very bad taste in my mouth.",0,1

What a surprised, they just left the hot water heater on the street without the buyer to sign off????? At the same time, there is a pick up truck park in front of my house having two guys sitting inside. They asked us "" is this your house""... and they left.

The Home Depot,This company is the fast food of home improvement,"This company is the fast food of home improvement stores. They talk about providing expert service and customer satisfaction. But once they have your money for a simple kitchen design and installation, the follow through is completely unprofessional and amateur. It is now 6-months into a small kitchen cabinet and countertop installation. Cabinets came damaged and installed ""as is"" without the inspection that was promised. How can a 5'1"", 75-year-old woman open up cabinet boxes and inspect them? Never mind that Home Depot said that they would do it. 5+ months after ordering and paying for everything, send someone to install warped cabinetry along with damaging the wall and cabinets further. Then Home Depot and cabinet rep come by and tell you that it's your fault because you didn't inspect everything previously. Excuse me! Oh not only are you out of luck because you didn't inspect your cabinets before installation, but the cabinets came from AZ to CO. Warping can happen. You are just out of luck. We aren't going to do anything.If you are thinking about using the Home Depot in Aurora, CO....RUN....RUN...far away to a professional company.

I began calling the phone number given to me by Home Depot and proceeded to get the run around over the course of 6 separate calls to numbers they gave me. In all fairness, I think the customer service at the store is great. It’s the delivery company they contract with that is horrible. I should have been contacted and told the delivery wasn’t happening as scheduled but no one notified me. This is awful and unacceptable.

The Home Depot,Wish I had read delivery reviews in …,"Wish I had read delivery reviews in advance. We purchased our kitchen appliances at Home Depot. First they give you a large window of time for when they may deliver your appliances. We were told between 10 and 2. So plan to take a whole day off work. The cook top and double oven were dropped off just inside the front door. We had to find our own installer to install these. The refrigerator was the biggest issue. The delivery guys cut the water line in back of the fridge while getting it out of the box. They allowed us to use this as a loaner for a week until fridge #2 could be delivered. That fridge must have sat in the hot sun or in a hot warehouse. The plastic packing had melted and adhered to the the stainless steel. No way to get it off without damaging the finish. So wait 10 more days and another 6 hour window for #3 to be delivered. This one was much better and we like it although the delivery guys did not adjust the French doors to be flush and attached the handles loosely. Took the Allen wrench with them so we had to find one and tighten ourselves. We are now pretty happy with the appliances. We've had them about 3 weeks.To be fair, GE Appliances gave us a $200.oo rebate for the troubles. I would not recommend Home Depot appliance delivery and will never shop for appliances there again. We were replacing 27 year old appliances. Sadly, the new ones don't last as long. We will read delivery reviews as well as appliance reviews next time!",0,2

The Home Depot,Terrible delivery and installation service from Home Depot!!!,"I agree with fellow customers. The delivery and installation service was horrible!We live in Thousand Oaks, CA. I placed my order for both garbage disposal and dishwasher on 08/16/2017. I asked them to ship the garbage disposal to me earlier so that I can replace my old broken garbage disposal before they come install the dishwasher. They didn't. On 09/02/2017, they came deliver both products and told me they (TEMCO delivery service, P. Valle) could not install the dishwasher because the garbage disposal was not replaced. I said that's because you didn't deliver the garbage disposal to me earlier. They didn't care and no apology was given. After dropping the products, they left. I spent some time to replace the garbage disposal myself and called back to reschedule for the dishwasher installation on 09/19/2017.I received a message on 09/18/2017 saying they will come install the dishwasher between 7 and 11 AM. At 08:29 AM on 09/19/2017, I received a call from (818)860-6730 saying they are from Home Depot and will arrive in 20 to 30 minutes. Guess what? They never showed up!I called (818)860-6730 twice at 10:03 AM and 11:20 AM and left message on voice mailbox.I called TEMCO (661-294-6727) at 10:34 AM and they had no clue where their guys are and told me they will check and let me know. Never did!I then tried to call local Home Depot stores at 03:22 PM and 03:29 PM but they said this is online order so I have to check online. I then used live chat to talk to Randall first but he was not helpful at all so I asked for a supervisor. I got Isaac H. online. He checked around and told me they (TEMCO folks) were caught up with unexpected delay and will come right after. Guess what? They still didn't show up.I then called TEMCO agaon at 04:40 PM but got hung up so I called again at 04:42 PM, I got Sandy on the phone but she didn't help and asked me to reschedule. I called again at 04:47 PM. This time, I got Lupe (warehouse manager) on the phone. She told me the people had left my area and won't come back to install the dishwasher and they have to reschedule it. No apology was given! I asked her to find out who called me in the morning and i provided her with the (818)860-6730 and she promised to find out and call me back (they use phone numbers to track orders). I ended up rescheduling the installation on 09/22/2017.I got online again at 7:18 PM and got another supervisor, Chris and tried to get his help to get an apology from TEMCO since this is Home Depot's partner but he was unable to help either. He said he could help issue an eGift card to compensate my time but he couldn't help get any real help.What I wanted was an apology from TEMCO. How hard is it to apologize when you did something wrong? It is a common courtesy to call and say they will be late or cannot come for XYZ reasons. but nothing.I called TEMCO at 02:34 PM trying to find out who stood me up the day before. I got Alexandra. She went to check with Lupe and came back telling me she closed her door and she will ask her to call me back in person. Of course, Lupe didn't call as usual.I then contacted Home Depot again on 09/20/2017. This time I got Todd and he's not helpful as usual. Cannot get an apology and Home Depot doesn't seem to be willing to push the partner to apologize for their wrongdoing.On 09/21/2017 at 03:51 AM, I got a automatic call (no live person) from TEMCO saying they will come between 10:30 AM and 02:30 PM on 09/22/2017.On 09/22/2017, I got a call from (818)860-6730 again at 11:44 AM (Giovani). When I asked him if he was the one who called me on Tuesday, he said no. When I said the call was from this very same number, he said it may be another guy on his team. He LIED. That was a cell phone he carried when he arrived. They spent about half hour to complete the installation. When I asked him after the installation, he still refused to admit he called but didn't show up. He simply said this was a rescheduled task and they have 42 trucks. When I asked about Lupe's boss (since she never called me back), he said Lupe is the one in the warehouse. The other guy, Jesse, is not possible to reach by the phone number.I truly don't know how Home Depot can have such a poor partner to work with them. This has hugely damaged their reputation (not saying they are very good in reputation before anyway). If I ran a company, I would certainly make all possible ways to correct this type of situation but Home Depot didn't do anything to help and left it to customers. No wonder you see almost all 1-star reviews here.I will post my complaint to all internet review sites I can find as I promised Todd.

Asked 5 different people for help and was told ok we will get someone. Waited 2 hours trying to get aomeone. Then they tried to sell me a stove with the glass broken on the oven door. Because they were to lazy to see if they had another one. 6 people just standing in a group playing on their phones and joking around... this was Lafayette la evangeline store,1,1

After scheduling the delivery for Sunday (8 AM- 9 AM), i got a call the day before telling me it will arrive between (8:30 AM to 12:30 PM), very inconvenient. After changing my Sunday plans around the delivery timing, I don't get the item until 2PM. on top of all this was paid delivery, so basically i paid 59.99 to have my Sunday ruined by Home Depot.",0,1
The Home Depot,"Deceiving, insulting, time wasting","Ordered a stove online. The total NOT SUBTOTAL said 471.06. I took a picture to ask my husband if he wanted this stove. Thank god I did. I hit order. It said, thank you for your order of 509.92! It was the first I saw that total! I didn't agree to this total, so I went online to cancel. No way to cancel. I texted them to a number that you can text them at. No response. I called them, I was on hold for 10 minutes, then transferred and was given a rep that said I was a liar basically even after I told him I had a picture of it!! He said, ""Thats not what we have on OUR end"". I told him he can either give me the stove to the price I agreed or cancel the whole order. Instead of giving me any reconciliation, he cancelled the order and now I have to wait 5 days for my money to return without even an apology just an insult! I was shopping at home depot almost everyday, I just bought a house in need of 100,000 in repairs, and now I will make SURE I shop ANYWHERE but here. Hope that was worth your 39 bucks HOMEDEPOT! 21 minutes of wasted time on the phone, an insult, and 5 days without my money. Nope, never again! I have included pictures of my review on other websites and other reviews",0,1
The Home Depot,Damaged order.....again!,"Ordered 18 boxes of flooring for my rental property, 6 of the 18 were damaged. Now here is my problem, did the receiver accept damaged boxes, because they were so bad the salesman did not even bring them out? Or did the receiver damage them in the store? Either way Home Depot needs better quality control. They are ordering replacements, but that will take a week and a half, which delays the installation, which delays the move in of my tenant, which costs me money!! This is not the first time I've had damaged items but it will be that last! I'm done with Home Depot!",0,1

Then I check online and bought one on Woodbridge Home Depot.The next morning I came to Woodbridge to pick up but they gave me the wrong one which I found out after I brought the heavy door upstair, they did not check the order. In the afternoon, they came to replace another product, this time this box has only the door, no hardware, nothing.I called then they promised to deliver the hardware by 12pm but now almost 3pm, after several phone calls to the store then still waiting with all the mess at my house.Please avoid Home Depot in your next trip and try Lowes instead if you want a better services.",0,1

The Home Depot,Ordered window treatments for my home,"Ordered window treatments for my home, the salesperson was excellent, went out of her way to keep in touch and make the purchase pleasant. The installation however was just the opposite, a real horror show. Some of the blinds do not lay level which is most likely not the installers fault, however should have made the adjustments that day. The real story is the damage done to the side walls of my new windows when he used a hammer to tap the drywall to make the shade fit the window when rolled all the way down. Did I mention this was a new house? This happened approximately 30 days ago and I have been in contact with the store manager or a woman who claims to be with this issue. Each time I am promised that the installer will call me and schedule a time to repair the damage and correct the uneven shades, both times nobody contacts me to begin to correct the issue. I am now going to write a complaint to the home Depot credit card that I placed the purchase on. Bottom line: price and service great, contracted installers pathetic.",0,1
The Home Depot,Do NOT purchase an appliance through Home Depot.,"When our refrigerator died earlier this month, I purchased a new appliance from our local Home Depot store. The absolute earliest delivery date they would give me was 9 days out. Try living without a refrigerator for 9 days. It was delivered by a contracted delivery team of three young men who obviously had little to no experience delivering and installing large appliances. They broke the interior molding and threshold of our front door bringing in the refrigerator and then when I noted that the door of the refrigerator was off kilter and wasn't closing correctly, they blamed the ""unlevel"" flooring in our kitchen. (I got a level out immediately after they left and the floor was perfectly level.) As if that weren't bad enough, the refrigerator completely stopped working less than 24 hours after it was installed. When calling the delivery complaint line (for the second time, of course) they said they would not be able to come pick up the broken appliance for ANOTHER week. That will make over 2 weeks we will be without a working refrigerator. In the year 1957 that might have been understandable. In 2017, it's absolutely ridiculous. I URGE you not to purchase an appliance through Home Depot.",0,1

So we had to get a credit from Discover since we used it to buy them. However Discover gives HD 60 days to reply, which means we have take all our wash to the laundromat. What a hassle! Both HD and Samsung deserve 0 stars.",0,1

Believe me, there was not much wind.The manufacturer offered no warranty or adjustment. An offer for me to buy only the broken part would have satisfied me. No offer was made from either Home Depot or the manufacturer.I was willing to pay for the one part. Instead, I ended up throwing the tent away and haven't bought from Home Depot in over a year.",0,3
The Home Depot,Flooring Nightmare,"If you have flooring needs, do NOT go to Home Depot. It took 6 months for them to make it right for us.

The Home Depot,Everything I ordered was damaged...,"Remodeled bathroom and ordered 3 faucets and shower door from Home Depot. All of the faucets arrived via UPS in damaged packaging. (The HD shipping dept. doesn't put items in shipping boxes - like Amazon does - they just slap a shipping label on the item and send it out!) Had to return 2 of them. The shower door I ordered through the store; it too had had damaging packaging and I was concerned that the contents might be damaged. Refused to accept the door and they ordered a replacement, but after waiting a month I gave up and took the damaged one. Sure enough, when I opened it, one of the shower door tracks was bent due to package being dropped. Had to order a replacement from Kohler. This company is run by a bunch of careless idiots.",0,2

HOWEVER NEVER BUY ANY APPLIANCE!!!

They BAYOU WAREHOUSE sucks the 1st time they had damaged dishwasher and had to change it at the last minute then the second time they came out they had the wrong cords and wires.

The Home Depot,“We will install it.” What a lie!  …,"“We will install it.” What a lie! Home Depot contracts with subcontractors to install; and does not monitor their installers and sidestep issues. We purchased high quality windows, and Home Depot promised to install them. They were unaware of changes in the state requirements for windows, three windows arrived from Home Depot’s warehouse cracked or broken, three different installers showed up at different times, one did not have a license or permit, another was a new employee (sent out alone) who had never installed a window before. Home Depot scheduled these installers and more than half of the appointments were missed. Complaints to Home Depot went unheeded and after several months, they refused to return calls. We now find one of the windows which leaks is not a roofing problem or a stucco problem, but is a window installation problem – something installed improperly. Beware of Home Depot’s judgment, integrity, or honesty. Quality of service is NOT included in their promises.Too bad there are no ""negative stars"" to rate Home Depot. I would choose: -5*",0,1

The Home Depot,Warranty Short-Change,"Beware if you're considering purchasing a lawn mower at Home Depot! On June 11th I purchased a Toro 22"" High Wheel lawnmower at Home Depot. The first time I used it, it was difficult to start. It finally started after I adjusted the spark plug wire. Each of the five times I used the mower, I had to fiddle with the spark plug wire. Sometimes it took me 15 or 20 minutes before I succeeded in starting the mower. Finally, on August 28 I ran out our patience and took the mower back to Home Depot. I intended to exchange it for the same model. They can't all be defective, right?Surprise! The exchange option ends in 30 days. After 30 days you must leave the mower for repair. And when you leave it, you also have to leave $19 to cover the cost of the repair ""estimate"" in the event that their ""experts"" decide the problem isn't covered by warranty.If I had known about the 30 day window, I would not have purchased the mower. Or-- I certainly would have brought it back withing the 30 day window instead of attempting to resolve the problem.I'm putting Home Depot in the penalty box for a while. I will do my best to get what I need at Menards or Lowes. THOSE OF YOU CONSIDERING PURCHASE OF APPLIANCES OR POWER TOOLS SHOULD ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WARRANTY. THIS TYPE OF WARRANTY SHORT-CHANGE MAY APPLY TO OTHER PRODUCTS.",0,1
