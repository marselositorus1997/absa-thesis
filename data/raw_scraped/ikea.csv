IKEA,Absolutely horrible customer service,Absolutely horrible customer service. Needed a table set that was not on the floor and was told if we go to customer service it would be brought right out. 2 HOURS have gone by and still no table. Absolutely horrible. Never again will I come back here.,0,1
IKEA,If only I had an option to put 0 stars,"If only I had an option to put 0 stars, I would have.Please listen to my call recording and let me know if I could have been anymore polite. All I did was ask to speak to a Manager. Name: John (last name not given due to security and safety purposes) got connected after 2 attempts of asking for a manager - EID (7018044) seemed to be totally pissed since I asked for a Manager. I was supposed to receive a package today the 8th May between 8AM to 5PM as per the app. When called into check they said it could taken longer 5-7 business days from when the app had to show the delivery date. The reason that amused me and forced me to put this feedback is that he made a statement ‘Nobody forced you to order from IKEA, It was your choice’. Last I remember I paid for the delivery and the products as well, If it was free I would have accepted. I don’t have any information on the tracking either. Please listen to the call recording and give him the feedback he deserves. I wish I could cancel the order and not deal with IKEA anymore. Never expected to be treated this way by IKEA. Order ID: 383212088I would be keen to know if ikea takes feedback seriously.Thanks,Mathew",0,1
IKEA,The IKEA delivery is a joke,The IKEA delivery is a joke. The driver claims there is no parking space even though we have dedicated private parking area large enough to easily accommodate their vehicle. And because they give a 7 HOUR window for delivery we have to wait there the entire time for the driver to give us false reasons not to deliver.,0,1
IKEA,Worst Service and abusive in speech,"I ordered an Alex Drawer Unit online and I made the mistake of back spacing and accidently making two orders. I ended up canceling one order and picking up only one. I was charged 3 times and refunded once for the canceled one. So Ikea charged me twice for the one I picked up. It took two hours to get it resolved and a refund. The lady told me call back if I don't get my refund in 7 to 15 days. So I called back and this lady yelled at me and called me a liar. You never yell at a customer or call them a liar. She said her system doesn't show the third charge. I told her I have been working in an office for 20 years and computer software's can make mistakes and be glitchy, she said not ours. I told her it is a computer they make mistakes. I told her I didn't remember my case number but every job I worked at we had a a computer system we log conversations in that we have with clients. She just kept arguing with me and calling me a liar. I asked for a supervisor and she said there is no supervisor. It was resolved eventually but Ikea needs to hire more professional people.",0,1

IKEA,I purchased a couple nightstands for my…,"I purchased a couple nightstands for my bedroom and when I went to put them together one of the wooden legs were warped and would not fit flesh with the nightstand. I had my daughter look up online to see if they had another in store. It stated they did so I packed up everything and went to exchange it but when I got there the associate Jessica in the Norfolk VA location looked it up and said they did not. However, she did a little more research and went to look, came back with nothing. Did more research and somehow by the grace of God they had the exact leg in the exact color in the back of the store and swapped it out for me so I wouldn’t have to return the whole thing. Thanks so much Jessica your customer service was OUTSTANDING today!",0,5
IKEA,Five months later and still no refund!,"When picking up shelving unit at Memphis store employee threw loose pieces with no box in back of my car. After driving three hours home I saw that pieces were missing. Couldn't get answer by phone so husband drove three hours back to store and was told that we would get missing pieces delivered in a few days. Months went by but no needed pieces. Husband used scrap wood to try to assemble furniture. Called store back and they said no order for missing hardware was ever placed. I was told to recycle or dispose of furniture and they would issue refund. Five months and a dozen calls to customer service later I still have not gotten refund. I disposed of unusable furniture, as directed by Ikea, so I am without needed shelving unit. Customer service has a script that they read that means nothing. I do not believe they ever intend on refunding my money.",0,1
IKEA,"Absolutely disgraceful service, if I could give no stars I would","Absolutely disgraceful service. We have a mattress within warranty which after inspection Ikea confirmed was faulty and that they would replace.When given the date that it would be collected and the new one delivered myself and my dad, who has recently had major surgery, lugged the mattress down the stairs. We waited in all day and nothing came. We called to find out what was happening only to be told it wasn't coming, someone had made a mistake. We were given a new date and told the old mattress would definitely be collected and the new one definitely delivered. So again we dragged the mattress down the stairs, waited in for another day. Nothing came. We called to be told that, again, someone had made a mistake and didn't book it properly. So we were given today's date. And again today we've brought the mattress down and waited for nothing to come a third time.Shocking service. Everytime we call we are told whatever it takes to get us off the phone and given false promises only to wait for nothing, three days wasted thanks to Ikea. We're taking our complaint further as we're absolutely furious at the time we've been stuck on the phone trying to sort this and days in waiting for nothing. Livid.",0,1

IKEA,Customer Service NOT Professional and…,"Customer Service NOT Professional and Abusive bad practice in the return of moneyOn March 27 I ordered and paid in ful 2 wardrobes with their respective accessories, delivered in 30 days, the day before delivery April 27 I received an email saying that a frame was out of stock? did they need 30 days to find out? or is it a practice to get free money? On April 27 the incomplete order arrived, which I rejected and the next day I went personally to Sunrise Branch to make my claim and a rude character told me that I should wait for them to call me to make the refund, today May 6, 2021 I am still waiting the call and how long will I have to wait for my money? I do not understand how USA regulations allow this outrage by foreign companies. Horrible situation !!!",0,1
IKEA,Terrible customer experience,"Ordered a complete PAX setup. Got a delivery date 6 weeks out, which we accepted and paid. Money was withdrawn and then 1 day before delivery we get a mail with 2 weeks delay on part of the delivery and a cancellation of 50% of the order. Hmmm it took you 5 weeks and 6 days to figure out you can't deliver?And you expect that we still want 50% of the delivery. So we could assemble 10 half closets? What a joke and extremely poor service",0,1
IKEA,Couldn't return items due to pandemic closures and now they won't take them,I bought items in March 2020 just before the lockdown. I've not been to return them sooner because we were locked down again from early November and the shop was only open for 2-3 months and I avoided going straight away due to it being busy in returns. My receipts had faded so they were not legible. It appears they furloughed and made staff redundant because staff were really unhelpful and wouldn't look up items and take them back with the excuse it was too long ago now. How can I return items when the shop is shut!? Ikea has now last my custom forever. I can get better stuff elsewhere and anything cheaper I can just get online so I will not use Ikea again.,0,1

IKEA,Placed an order it took 2 weeks to get…,Placed an order it took 2 weeks to get the order. A delivery truck pulled up two weeks later 3 hours early then the scheduled delivery time. can appreciate that but I also plan my day around the time frame that I am given. They brought all of the items into the house. They needed me to sign a document of course they didnt have a pen so I dug for one. After they left I noticed a hardware part was missing. I called Ikea twice and finally got through to someone who told me I have to wait 7-10 more days. IKEA is 2 hours away so I offered to drive their but they couldn't get ahold of anyone at the store. My advice is to go to the store and dont order online. Save yourself 100 delivery make it a family trip with the 100 and you will wind up not spending all the money and have fun for a day. IKEAs delivery is a joke dont waste your money. Most of the delivery companies are a joke as well.Signed: Pissed off and tired of crappy service.,0,2
IKEA,I love IKEA but the last few experiences leave a lot to be desired,"I love IKEA furniture the kallax in particular. However their delivery service for such a big company is a joke. It's expensive for anything that isn't very very light weight and takes weeks to arrive. You get what you pay for I suppose but you do expect an item to at least function no matter how much money you spend on it. We have now had a bad experience with two items of furniture one a wardrobe with needed work doing to it to get the sliders to work, the other a kallax which arrived cracked. To be fair to IKEA I did not call them or attempt to rectify this which is not their fault I hate returning stuff but it shouldn't be damaged in the first place. That being said I will probably use them again despite the last few poor experiences because in the end I like the furniture",0,3
IKEA,IKEA IS AWFUL,"IKEA IS AWFUL. I've gone there with a friend once or twice and thought it was very nice. Ordered an armoire for my expected child and had to pay the extra $100 for delivery. Opened the boxes as soon as it arrived and the door was damaged and a shelf. Waited on the phone for someone to answer in customer service for ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES. They told me my product would not be back in stock for two months and I could either receive a refund or re-order. Asked for refund. It then took TWO months to receive the refund, after 3 calls made into customer service again. I had one phone call where I waited only one minute and of course the two others were over 30 minute wait times! Finally received our refund today.. ONLY HALF OF THE REFUND was put into our bank. Tried to call back again today regarding it.. 30 minute hold time - had to hang up and will be calling back tonight when I have more time. VERY DISAPPOINTING DEALING WITH IKEA FOR SURE.",0,1

IKEA,My Ikea Adventure:,"My Ikea Adventure:For a company this large their customer service is beyond awful. Here is our IKEA experience:We are trying to purchase the PAX closet system in white; we live north of Tulsa Oklahoma.First I get on line and try to order the system and just go pick it up at the store.Their system will not allow for me to accomplish that. I try calling the store. I am on hold for over an hour, get transferred 3 times and then disconnected. So, we take a day off work and drive the 5 plus hours to Dallas. When we get there and find the Pax system displays we had a hard time finding an employee to help with ordering what we needed. However, when we did get help, her name was Christina and she was the best thing about IKEA. She knew what she was doing and was extremely helpful in designing the closet system to fit our closet. As luck would have it they did not have all of the pieces we needed but we could get close if the Frisco, TX. Store had the corner unit that the system showed in stock. It took over 45 minutes for her to get to talk to the other store to check stock. She got them to reserve the corner frames for us. She rings us up gives me the ticket for their store and a ticket to pay for the items at the Frisco store. Now they have you pull around back to a numbered parking spot and text them that you are ready for your items.A young lady comes out with 2 carts full of boxes, stops at my truck, looks at the ticket and then leaves. Never comes back. So, apparently you have to load your furniture in the truck. Thankfully I am in good enough shape and not handicapped or elderly. We drive to the Frisco store. I go in and ask a lady at the cash registers the best way to pay the ticket. She points me to a self-checkout. After I pay the bill I ask her if I have to pull around to a dock like the other store. She tells me “I just started here and don’t know” and walks off.I go over to an in store counter with my ticket and ask the young man there the same question. He points at a TV screen, then my ticket and tells me “See these numbers, when they come up on the screen we can help you”. Okay, so it’s another 10 minute wait. My number pops up, I had them the ticket and they give me oversized boxes on a small cart and walk away. So now I get to push this cart thru the store and across the parking lot to my truck without the cart flipping over or the boxes sliding off. This time I am rescued by my wife who held the cart still while I wrestled the boxes into the truck.Fast forward to today – 5-4-2021I get online and try to order the 2 frames and the shelves that were out of stock. Surprise, the website won’t calculate delivery. I go to the chat box help. What do they recommend – They tell me I need to just go into the store instead of trying to order online and that they think the system must just be backed up and the warehouse is too busy to accept orders right now. I didn’t even bother to tell them it’s a 5 hour drive to go in the store.IKEA has some really nice things and the prices are not horrible but if you don’t live close, you just have to hope when you get there they have what you were after because you sure can’t check any other way.",0,2
IKEA,Terrible experience with the delivery service,Ordered a couch worth $700. Received a message in the morning saying that it should be delivered between 11am-3pm. Waited the entire day to know that the delivery failed at 7:30pm. Tried calling IKEA customer service multiple times during the work hours to track the status but nobody to answer. I don’t know who to get in touch with or what to do about this. Terrible experience!,0,1
IKEA,Do not buy Utlangan outdoor decking,"Do not buy Utlangan outdoor decking, it warps after it’s installed, and it happened in less than a week! I posted a bad review about it and they asked me to bring it in to have quality checked. Customer service told me it’s from water exposure (there was no water exposure) or sun exposure (this happened, it got up to 80 deg outside). I installed this decking over a perfectly good, level concrete patio for a more appealing look. Soooo, they make outdoor decking that can’t be outdoors 😡😡😡 And at $3.50/sq ft it’s not worth the hassle!",0,1

IKEA,They have lost my order and I haven’t been refunded,"I placed an order last week and was supposed to receive it today. I used up one of my vacation days just to be at home. I couldn’t track my order on the website so I contacted IKEA to confirm the delivery time. To my surprise, they replied that an error had occurred and could not find my order number in their system. They have asked me to place the order again but I have not been refunded for my previous order (almost 300€) and have not been offered any type of compensation or express delivery to make up for the wait and the vacation day I had to use up. I have tried to contact them on the chat and telephone number but no one has been able to help me. Their only suggestion is that I write an email, but it takes them several days to reply to emails.

IKEA sender automatisk svar tilbage at de har modtaget min email og vender tilbage indenfor 24 timer!2 hverdage efter er der stadig ikke svar!Jeg vælger at beholde reolen med skaden, da jeg ikke har mulighed for at returnere den (den var ret tung og jeg har ikke bil), og vil ikke risikere at skulle vente over 1 mån. igen og så igen måske modtage endnu en ødelagt reol! Så jeg samler reolen og maler den der hvor skaden er så det ikke ses så meget.Dagen efter jeg har samlet og malet den, modtager jeg så endeligt et svar fra IKEA!

IKEA,IKEA refuses to return funds,I made two online orders on 3/23 and 3/25 with an expected delivery date of 4/9. They cancelled one of the orders on 4/4 with no good reason and wouldn’t reinstate it when I called so I cancelled the second order since I wanted the furniture pronto. I never got anything so processing a refund on an order that they cancelled shouldn’t be that hard. As of 5/3 they still have over $4k of my money. Not sure why processing refunds on orders that were cancelled is so difficult in 2021. Using COVID as an excuse is deplorable.,0,1

IKEA,The worst shopping experience of my life,"I made an online order that never arrived. Since then I spoke to 4 different @IKEA Customer Service staff on the phone – which only happens after enduring a long waiting time. After these time-consuming attempts, none of them can actually explain what is wrong with my order. Each of them tells a different tale. I don’t know who’s actually telling the truth and no possible solution comes to sight. I am just told to wait. Cancellation could be an option but only for half the amount paid. The worst is that we cannot speak nor contact anyone from the IKEA store, there's no accountability. The only point of contact is these intermediate ""staff"" that know nothing.

IKEA,Worst in-store customer service,"If you are wondering why #ikea has the worst customer service rating, this is a good example: I was just trying to buy and get delivered furniture for 2 rooms for our village house...After 1 month of trying to order online I realized that half of their products are always unavailable online, but available in the store...I don’t give up :).It’s Good Friday and I have 2 hours between my 14m old baby naps, so I decide to go to the store and order on spot. I arrive at the parking in the very “family friendly” store, I have to carry my not so light baby around until I find shopping cart or someone to direct me to such. Yeahhh, finally I see one next to the entrance, but behind the bars...and since there is noone to direct me, I wander around for 15 min trying to find a way in the store with the trolley and I see a lady going up with the elevator. I follow and I end up at the EXIT. There for God knows what reason there are 2-3 security people - so noone at the entrance, but everyone guarding the exit. I am told that I can’t enter and I need to go all the way back, leave the trolley, carry my baby all the way up and eventually find one trolley there. All these while another lady that just went out is allowed to get back in right in front of me...I am told “these are the rules”, but I didn’t understand why they are valid for me and not the other lady, so I ask to see the manager. After 10-15 min two ladies come out to explain that Ikea stores all around the world are badly organized and you have to carry around babies or you can take your own push-chair and push both and “these are the rules”. Well, I confirm I understand their rules and I will consider going to Ikea with my child next time...However I am already there for more than 30-40 min with 14m old baby getting impatient, so would they be good to let me in, Mrs. Julia Mihaylova with the most cold blood look and tone said - these are the rules and went back in through the EXIT. I guess this day, those rules were valid only for mothers with babies - not for other customers or employees...So after I lost my 2 hours, I finally gave up to buy this furniture from #ikea...",0,1

Not only my order wasnt complete and I didnt receive any notification about it, but also one part of the wordrobe I ordered was seriously damaged inside the box, without the box being hit. That means that part was put inside the box already broken. I called the customer service in order to come and replace it, but they told me that it is my responsibility to tranfer the part all by myself back to IKEA Odense.

IKEA,No communication - missing items - long delivery times,I ordered some items through the IKEA website at the beginning of April and they indicated it would be delivered on 29 April. I received no communication after that even though the confirmation email said I would receive communications about the delivery a couple days prior. The boxes showed up a day before delivery date with no communication. They were packaged incredibly poorly with the rug sheddings making a mess and the candles I had ordered wax all over the place where I had to vaccume everything. Then I was missing two items. No communciation about this. When I went on the website it just said at the bottom of my order that there was a refund for an amount that added up to these two items. It would have been fine if I had received communications earlier about these items being out of stock but I received NO communication. And I have no idea when I will receive this refund either.

IKEA,Worst Purchase Ever,"Bought a PAX planner for my childs closet. Loved the idea of being able to design it and make it fit our needs.

I have been working with IKEA for the past month and a half to see if I can get my wardrobe, so that i can use my shelves that are useless without the wardrobe frame. Spoke with 4 different people, 1 hour apiece and the end result was ""this frame is unavailable for delivery in your area, so the only option for you is refunding the PAX wardrobe"". So I paid $50 for shipping on an item that was not delivered and have 6 shelves that I paid $60 for that are absolutely useless. Why was I also allowed to proceed with the items within my cart? I can be refunded for said 6 shelves, but have to send them back to IKEA and pay shipping myself. WHAT? Will never be buying from IKEA again.",0,1

I understand that things are on back order and such due to covid but how they are handling it is TERRIBLE to say the least. I would not suggest anyone put themselves through it. THey never call back.

IKEA,What an absolute disgrace.,"What an absolute disgrace.IKEA Dublin:After waiting for a month for a delivery, for a high price, even two of the items were damaged. One of them were dropped from the truck right in front of me. For the high price of delivery, I would expect a much better service.When trying to contact them about this, I realized they don't have a CS email address, the live chat is not working, they don't pick up the phone.So I have contacted them via FB Messenger.They have answered once, asked for all my details and then silence, so I got no meaningful answers.I don't know when IKEA sunk to this depth, but this is really pathetic.Every professional company has a CS email address in the 21th century and you are an international company not an Instagram celeb.We have no other choice, but to turn to customer protection agencies.Sad.EDIT - 2021-04-30:Today I have received the replacement items and one of the items were damaged again. Out of 4 boxes in total, which is an achievement.It will take another ""5-7 days"" to get this one which makes it more than a month waiting for this order.It would be great if IKEA, if it is really needed at all, would delegate delivery to professional companies who actually know how to handle wares.This is ridiculous.",0,1

Customer services offered to replace (with another 3 weeks wait for delivery!).Lights are pendant fittings and require hooks screwed in the ceiling to hang them - despite being VERY expensive light fittings hooks are not supplied requiring trip to a hardware store to buy hooks.

IKEA,Awful service.,"I have never given a bad review before. However, IKEA has failed me utterly, so I feel I have to let people know. They never sent one of my items, charged me for it though, so I reached out on Facebook to let them know. That was close to a month ago. Customer service replied that my refund would be processed in 10 days max. No refund in sight. Also they don't respond at all anymore. What a shame and a disappointment. What an unprofessional and incompetent way to do business, with such disregard to the customers. Shame on you IKEA.",0,1

IKEA,Breaking Equality Law.,"Breaking Equality Law.I'm a disabled customer & got into a lot of distress in the incredibly busy, and very long queues at Nottingham.Approached staff in panic asking to be given help to get out of queue and get to exit.This was refused & I was told me don't allow people to jump the queue.I was merely asking for support to get to safety.I was distressed & the two staff members (a woman joined the man I was talking to ) were incredibly defensive.I was in a distressed state. & I believe store visitors were filming the scene.Was too distressed to take this further unfortunately - when I felt well enough to progress, I realised as I didn't have receipt, it would be challenging to prove the details of this visit & didn't feel like fighting, but their policy is a discriminatory & therefore a legal issue.(Anyway, the policy is unevenly enforced, as on entering the store, a lovely (thank you to her,a real star) female staff member saw I was disabled, and helped me to get into the store quickly and safely.",0,1
IKEA,DON'T GET IN TRAP BY IKEA -EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR IKEA,"EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR IKEAI am writing this review because I really don't want anyone else experience my frustration with IKEA.I went to IKEA to buy some furniture on finance for my new place 3 weeks ago. One of the staff walked me through applying for IKEA credit card to be able to buy them on finance and I got approval and she provided me with a paperwork to give to cashier at the check out.She told me that I would be eligible for a 6 month promotion if my purchase is under $600 but it would be eligible for a 10 month promotion if my purchase is more than a $1000.So, I decided to purchase some furniture for a total of 1,251.00.The next day, I received welcome emails from IKEA regarding my IKEA credit card, so I called them to schedule payments to prevent possible interests.The customer service told me that I was only eligible for the 6 months promotion and not the 10 months.I was frustrated but I decided to put some pressure on myself and pay it back in the 6 months. Then the customer service lady said that she couldn't not schedule any payments until I receive the physical credit card by mail in a couple of days.After 2 weeks I received the credit card and I called them right away to set up an auto payment.The customer service who was a gentleman apologized me saying that the IKEA staff had made a mistake and she had put me on another IKEA credit card that had no promotion. He suggested me to go to the IKEA location in Costa Mesa California where I purchased the furniture to explain the situation to their customer service and he said that the IKEA staff could call the contact number on the back of the credit card to help them to get it fixed.So I took another trip to IKEA in Costa Mesa.The customer service couldn't help me ,so they directed me to their supervisor, her name is KYLIE.Although it was absolutely their staff mistake, she aggressively told me that she couldn't help me unless I apply for the other credit card with promotion then she would process a return/refund on my receipt and she would put them on new card with promotion. I accepted her offer but it was just the beginning of IKEA's trap.She said that she wont be able to process the return until I return all the stuff back to IKEA. I told her that they are all assembled and I have also paid for their assembly so she just needed to do the process on the paper without returning all those furniture back but KYLIE said that the furniture should be returned, also she will not even refund the whole money back because the furniture had been unpacked.Also, I couldn't buy my furniture back any more.It means that I needed to return furniture to get paid for part of my payment ,then I could apply for the other card, then I would go back to store to buy them all unassembled again.I AM STILL SHOCKED OF IKEA'S CUSTOMER SERVICEIT IS SAD BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL BAD WHENEVER I LOOK AT MY FURNITURE THAT I GOT FROM IKEATHIS WAS MY FIRST AND IT WILL BE MY LAST EXEPERIENCE WITH IKEA AND I EDUCATE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOT TO GO THERE",0,1
IKEA,BAD EXPERIENCE,"02.06.21 - We bought 3 large items and some smaller ones. We live 2.5 Hours away from the store. We were told by a store rep that the 3 larger items were in stock. When we went to receive our large items, we were told that two of the items were located too high and couldn't be brought down until after hours and we could pick them up the next day. I argued a bit and stressed the fact that we lived 2.5 hours away, brought our truck which costs $50.00 a trip. No help there. 02.07.21 Returned to the store to pick up the 2 items. We picked them up and went home (2.5 hours - or 5 hours round trip) for another $50.00.Upon arriving home removed all parts from one of the units and began assembly. Found a side of the cabinet (part) that was not constructed correctly. Being Sunday, I opened the other unit (same item) and it had the correct part. Completed assembly.02.08.21 Called customer service, spent 2 hours, one on hold, explaining the issue. Was asked to circle the part in the assembly manual and take pictures of that and email them to the customer service person. I did so and verified with the person that they got the email. She said the part would ship in 3 to 5 days to my door. After 2 weeks + of waiting for my part, I called the customer service line again (another hour on hold) and the person I spoke with said the part was too large to ship and that I would have to return the bad part to the store and they would open the box so I could get the correct part out. Part being the side of the wardrobe, requires my truck to transport. At this point I was infuriated. I called the Merriam Kansas store to verify that they had the wardrobe in stock and drove (2.5 hours) to the store bringing the bad part in. I explained the issue to the customer service rep and she said it would be a few minutes for some one to bring the box down. 35 minutes later, I asked about it and she disappeared then returned with the 2 boxes. I explained that the part was in the large box and removed the smaller one from on top of it. She starts cutting the box open with a standard box knife, which, since the package says, no cutting (picture of a box knife with a circle with a line through it) I assumed she knew what she was doing. Nope. Put cut marks on the outside side of the wardrobe part. I was extremely upset, didn't say anything except, 'oh, you cut my part'. She offered to get yet another box down. At that point I took the part and left. I decided I would switch places with the other unit and the side with the cut would be against the wall. SO, I will NEVER buy anything from Ikea again and suggest NO ONE else does either. Furniture quality is 'OK' (3 out of 5) Service is EXTREMELY incompetent and I am out an extra $100.00 because of 2 extra trips to the store that I should not have had to make.",0,1
IKEA,Never Ever Again,"My first experience at IKEA will be my last. Saturday, March 20, 2021, I drove an hour and a half from my home to IKEA. I was so excited for my first time, as I am a huge lover of interior design and home decor. I went in after some research looking for some clear dining chairs. I fell in love with the TOBIAS chair and had my mind set on getting them. I looked on the website that morning to confirm they were in stock before my drive. After walking through the showroom and grabbing some additional cute things, I went to go and grab the chairs. I find the aisle and bin only to find bottoms and not the tops. I look around to make sure they weren't misplaced and go and ask a team member for help. I looked again on the website, where it showed there was still availability for them. He looks at his tablet and it shows inventory on the chairs are 14. He walks me down the aisle and says, someone might have bought them and forgotten the bottoms that more chairs would be in on Monday. Disappointed, I returned to the showroom to see if any other chairs would work. I saw about 6-7 of the clear TOBIAS chairs on the floor and thought I would ask another team member if those can be sold since I made such a far drive. Again, to my disappointment, floor models cannot be sold unless they are discontinued. She said they can be ordered and shipped to my house, to go back to the self-serve warehouse and have someone build an order for them. I spoke with a manager, who waived the delivery fee, and said I can come pick them up the next day, Sunday, at the store, that they were getting another shipment. So, one person told me Monday, another told me Sunday, the website shows availability on the chairs, and the inventory on the team members tablet showed availability as well. There is so much inconsistency. So, I go ahead and have the team member order the chairs for me to ship to my house since it was a far drive for me. The team member guaranteed the chairs would be delivered by Monday. I hadn't checked my email until Monday morning, to see an email from IKEA, excited, hoping it was shipping details. No, it's an email from SATURDAY, the day I put in the order, stating they are out of stock. The day the team member ordered them for me. So easily my money was taken but they weren't even available. AND to this day, I’m still waiting for them to return my money for them. I am appalled, disappointed and so unsatisfied with my experience with this company. I will never recommend or shop here ever again. Ever. This is so ridiculous.",0,1

It has been almost a month and I’m still missing a pillow case. I have called 6 times to get updates and the only 2 emails I received for the order confirmation and to let me I was getting my partial delivery which I actually thought was going to be complete. The phone agents have been very pleasant though.I can’t believe how little effort they put into keeping you updated. Everything I have found out about this order has been because I had to call and ask. I have even been on hold for more than 45 minutes on one call, when my situation was escalated. I hung up eventually.I think on top of my disappointment, I am also surprised because being that the situation in retail in so dire,I would think a company would try to hold on to every customer they have.

Item delivered (cost of delivery almost half the price of the item) and when delivered found to be broken. The packing, done by IKEA, was entirely unsuitable for posting. I am elderly and about 50 miles away from nearest IKEA. IKEA's 'help' page suggests taking item back to shop, which of course is closed during the pandemic. I have no means of getting to a shop anyway. With difficulty found a phone number which provided a lot of options except for a person to speak to -- no one ever picked up the phone. Online information said phones were answered until 20h00, but at 18h15 a recorded message said phone lines were closed. The frustration is astounding, deliberate and the whole process is unhelpful. There is no easily accessible support from IKEA and so I will inevitably be stuck with a broken light fitting that can never be used.",0,1

First manager told us ""oh, yeah I can make an order for this couch, it will be delivered in about two weeks"" and sent an e-mail with the bill. We payed, but then received the second email ""wasn't paid, try again"". We call AGAIN (FYI, every call you wait AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF on the line).

A lady answered and redirected us to another department when we were waiting on the line 1 hour 15 minutes and the call was dropped!!!! We called AGAIN, another lady answered saying ""apologize"" and redirected A-G-A-I-N!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE LINE!!!!!! Conclusion: DON'T USE IKEA DELIVERY SERVICE IN FLORIDA!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!",0,1
IKEA,Really bad experience,"Really bad experience, I purchased for mistake a product that was missing a piece. The customer support refused to refund me and I had to purchase a new one.

IKEA,3 orders undelivered. Abysmal service. Don’t waste your money!,"This is now the third day I’ve sat at home patiently waiting for the items I paid for to not be ordered. These are three separate orders and all 3 times no delivery, no way to contact them except a phone number that is never answered and no notification from them acknowledging that your stuff hasn’t turned up. I’ve tweeted them and left Facebook messages - nothing! Like I don’t exist. Had better service from eBay sellers from the Far East. Never experienced anything like this in my life. I’ve spent hundreds of pounds and nothing.Don’t waste your money.",0,1
IKEA,"Careless delivery, damaged item","I have purchased a sofa bed, it arrived quickly and was easy enough to assemble as we have proper tools at home. It is also looking great and comfortable, no complaints there. However, the bottom storage compartment arrived with two large holes punched in it (the box itself had two large holes as well) so we are sure it was damaged during delivery. Seeing the back of the delivery van I am surprised that only one part of the sofa was damaged, things were just thrown on top of each other quite carelessly. Everything would have been great if there was any attention paid to the delivery.",0,2
IKEA,The red hook location is very hateful…,"The red hook location is very hateful biased and anti semitic. I was trying to enter a complaint over the phone and so far noone came to the phone to submit one.As difficult as it is to wear a mask and be able to breath, especially when highly pregnant, all of us had one on. We were walking through the store and looking for the things we came for, while talking between each other or on the phone , keeping our distance and minding our business when one of the working personel got wild and yelled to pull up the mask. Which we did. She then still brought security to escort us out. There was no reason to do so. She might have had a hard day , still doesnt give one the power to single a group out and humiliate them. We demand an apology for this biased behavior.Would be nice to get our order too.Thank you,E. R.",0,1

IKEA,The worst customer service ever,We purchased a mattress with a 25year guarantee after 3 years it sunk. We called IKEA and they sent out a surveyor to look at the mattress and agreed that it was a manufacturing defect. Ikea arranged to replace with a new mattress and take the old one away. We were told that one delivery van would deliver and another would take away. The take away van arrived first so we gave the driver our mattress the new mattress never turned up and we were then told that it would be 5 days later. This left us with nothing to sleep on for 5 days.When we complained we were told to buy a blow up mattress this was at 6.30pm on a Sunday during lockdown with no stores open. We were then told our complaint was escalated and a manager would call us we are still waiting 3 days later with nothing to sleep on.,0,1
IKEA,"Two days wasted waiting for non-deliveries, no communication.","A truly shambolic company I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing anything off them. I ordered two bedside cabinets, unfortunately they were both chipped on arrival - these things happen.

Rang up, listened to Abba for half an hour before being told they weren't collecting but we can book delivery for next Tuesday.Again another day off work, didn't turn up, no communication. Ring up customer services, it will now be April 20th (supposedly). Customer service representitive couldn't care less about the company's useless service.I compare this to John Lewis, I had a faulty blind and it was all sorted and replaced within a few days.

IKEA,One star because zero isn't possible!,"I am giving one star because zero isn't an option. IKEA is an absolute joke these days! Back in November I ordered a play kitchen for my little girl's Christmas. It wasn't delivered on the day it was supposed to be so I rang and I was told it would be a bit later. I waited but still no kitchen. I rang again and was told that the item wasn't available anymore in their delivery facility. I had to cancel the order and drive to dublin to pick it up in store. I thought it was just a hick up due to Christmas. But it wasn't!On 4th of February I put in a big order to kit out our new house. The earliest day possible for delivery was the 30th March, almost 2 months later! I went ahead with order as it wasn't urgent stuff I was ordering. Today, I didn't get a delivery notification so I rang to see if the order was on the way. I was told again that some items weren't in stock (although they were all in stock when I ordered!!) and that it would take another 2 weeks!! I asked for a next day delivery but she said it wasn't possible so I cancelled my order. Again, it is an absolute joke! So disappointed!",0,1
IKEA,Their online services during Covid seriously lacking,"I have used their online system twice. The 1st time there was a simple part missing. Their website is a disaster. The ""Customer services"" page only has FAQ's. The ""contact us"" link just goes back to Customer Services which does not have any contact details. The ""missing part"" link requires a part no, if there isn't one you have to visit the store, making the online system a joke. So the only option left is to return the item, the ""return policy"" page says if you bought it online and require IKEA to collect simply press the link to the ""Contact Us"" page! You guessed it, that page has no way to actually contact them! They may have great stuff but they need to pay attention to their website and customers actual needs. If I could give them less than 1 star I would,",0,1

IKEA,Horrible experience from Ikea Netherlands,"I bought a sofa bed on January 6th with delivery and assembly, but the people who came to assemble it, were not able to do it properly, indeed the part of the sofa that makes the sofa become a bed did not stay in its position but goes off the rail that makes it stays attached to the chore of the sofa. I called customer service to fix the problem. Two weeks later, two guys from the Ikea assembly group came to my house with the intention of fixing the problem with this sofa, but even this time they were not able to solve it. I called the customer service who told me earlier that they could not replace the sofa for lack of trucks for delivery but they could come to pick it up to make the return, then I checked on the site of ikea.nl and there were possibilities to replace it. So, I called them and they told me that they would take charge of my request for annulment of the return and they started the replacement request. On the canceled day set for the return, 2 guys came to my place for taking the sofa back but I explained to them that it had been canceled, then I called the customer service of IKEA Netherlands that was not able, from March 8 (date of annulled pick up) to exchange the sofa. They told me to send them the pictures of the problem and explaining what was the problem with the sofa. After having sent the pictures I had to wait two weeks for the inquiry to be processed. Today, March 29, the weeks have passed and I called Ikea Netherlands to have an explanation about it and the lady on the phone answered me arrogantly, and while I was talking she threw me down the phone.I think I’m going to report it to the police.",0,1
IKEA,Ordered a month ago. Never arrived. No contact from them.,"Ordered a month ago, was emailed the night before delivery, and the morning of, with a confirmation time the truck would arrive....They never showed! No contact from them regarding why it never showed, or to reschedule delivery. Trying to contact them is pointless....They wont answer emails, and disconnect your calls after waiting for hours. They must be making quite a bit of interest off the money they are holding on to, when they obviously don't have the items to sell, despite them being marked as in-stock when ordering, and saying they are in a truck on their way to you.....For such a big Company like IKEA to pull this kind of crap, is absolutely disgusting!!!!!!!.......This is FRAUD!!!!!",0,1
IKEA,IKEA does not know quality,"Purchased a new countertop, its cracked. Got my kids new dressers and they are of the lowest quality, and most of the hardware holding it together is plastic.

IKEA,Failure to deliver within their obligations and dreadful customer services,"We ordered a Superking mattress and paid £50 for 'express delivery'. We were given a delivery time on a Saturday between 7am-7pm. We tracked the delivery and could see the vehicle was about 7 miles from us. a couple of hours past and nothing arrived. The message we got when we checked the tracking again was 'we are unable to deliver your item' We tried to get through to customer service but to no avail. The following day after holding for 40 minutes we finally got through to then be cut off! Called again another 30 mins on hold and finally got through to a customer services representative. We were told 'they had not got the correct item on the lorry', we asked 'why we had not had confirmation of this and were shocked when they said 'they would not have contacted us and it was up to us to contact them!!'. If this wasn't bad enough, they refused to refund the £50 we had paid for 'express delivery' and offered us a £10 gift voucher!!! We appreciate things go wrong but to refuse to refund the 'express delivery charge' when it was their fault is absolutely outrageous. Vey little in a way of apology and the represented said we would have to wait another week for delivery. We will be looking at Ikea's legal obligations under their 'express delivery' contract to assess any liability, but all it would have taken was a 'we are really sorry for your inconvenience' and 'we will of course refund you as it was our fault'. A real shame as Ikea offer excellent products but badly let down by their dreadful customer care!",0,1

And to add, I was expected to collect from only 4 stores, the closest being Croydon AND the other 3 outside London as far as Southampton! Why! Try it I urge you! So, I put in a postcode further away i.e. Enfield Town, a couple of miles further away from me. Low and behold any item was now available for collection. Why are you not allowing local people to collect fromm the store? This is discrimination. How dare you.",0,1
IKEA,A staff in Ikea North York is so mean,"I went to Ikea North York in Toronto on Mar 25th, 2021. I needed some dressers (that was the first time I bought some stuffs like that in Ikea).

I had other dresses that I saw online, and I showed to a staff in there to ask how I could have that items. He gave me a map and wrote down the note about area that I could find them. I asked him wrote down the area for a malm dresser also, but he refused, he said that I had it in my phone (the malm dresser’s tag photo). And he repeated the same sentence when I asked him again. What is the heck’s service? I went to shopping with 2 kids, 1 hand for stroller, 1 hand for his map and hand for my phone and eyes on my kids? That’s the way Ikea treat customer? I just needed a paper with all area’s information I must come to pick up. It is really difficult for him or I required too much? So terrible He is.

I spent almost an hour on the phone with the customer service call center. Warning: They do not know how to take care of customers. They simply answer the phone. I received more misinformation including a FAKE FedEx tracking number. I guess they just want to quiet down the customer who is expecting the service that IKEA has promised. My no-delivery issue was escalated to the ""resolution department"" which is a joke because NOTHING was resolved except the fact that customer service at IKEA just doesn't care about the customer. I left a message at the corporate (USA) office - the recording says I will hear back within 24 hours. Let's see. Until then, zero resolution, no one knows where my product is or when it will be delivered, and ""customer service"" has upset and disappointed a customer. DO NOT order from IKEA online.

IKEA,Bad service all around,"So I ended up buying a fridge from ikea Thursday evening. I called in as it’s a big purchase and didn’t want anything to go wrong by me making any kind of mistake by doing an online purchase.Delivery was set the next day between 9am-1pm.Friday rolls around, drivers get to my house. They inform me that they cannot go into my house to bring the fridge inside, just the platform right inside of the door.I was furious as I just needed it to go 3 steps of stairs, which I cannot do myself or have the equipment for.I instantly called ikea to cancel my order as I still needed a fridge since the food was spoiling. The guy I spoke to said he gets it, and based on our conversation, they have had numerous complaints as he states “it’s at the point where I just process the paperwork.”I later receive a call from ikea that I missed as I was still working (from home). When I called them back, they needed to confirm the refund.I informed her that I had already called previously to do so. Resulting in me being quite upset of having to deal with them so many times.Then I found out that it’s a 7-10 business day processing time for the refund, which I find absolutely rediculous.My fridge stopped working the day before I called and made the order. I need a fridge, and I have to wait another 2 weeks to get my refund and buy another fridge? That is unacceptable as there were no disclaimers regarding no entering of my house for Covid purposes, and no disclaimer for the refund policy.Furthermore, the drivers were dishonest as the notes on file stated that it didn’t fit in my doorway. Not because they didn’t want to enter my house. They took out a measuring tape and took a picture. They didn’t even take the fridge out of the truck.Today, Sunday, I receive ANOTHER call from ikea to reschedule the delivery. Like, really? After all that, they still haven’t cancelled my order?They lack communication to their customers and don’t seem to care.

IKEA,Totally Disappointed in this Experience,"I wish I'd read these reviews before spending over $15,000 on a kitchen from Ikea. I'm so exhausted after this experience....sitting here in tears and thought I'd warn others.How do they get away with treating their customers like complete garbage? 1. First, they nickel and dime you for every single item. That translates into multiple deliveries and an entire garage full of individual boxes.2. They insist you inventory every item before you make an appointment for installation. No one explained this process at all. It took me plus 4 of my neighbors 3 hours to complete the items inventory.3. I ended up making 4 trips back to the store for missing or out-of-stock items. They charged me for more items than I needed, Other items that were needed they never include.4. The installation happened in the 2 days promised time however they charged for every single extra cut they made to the sum of over $500.Every trip made to the store was one frustration after another with absolutely no help from store associates. At the end of the day, if you're considering a large purchase you could spend the same amount at a well-respected company that cares about their customers and appreciate their business.",0,1

So then I had to call and wait on hold forever. I had to email a photo of the broken item. Was told I would get a full refund. Checked online and was only issued a refund for the item cost, not the shipping cost. So I had to call again - waited on hold yet again - and then the customer service agent couldn’t open the software for 10 minutes. She then told me IKEA doesn't refund shipping costs - even for damaged items! I told her that’s unacceptable - why should I pay for their mistakes and products that break? Then the call was cut off. So then I had to call AGAIN. Was told that IKEA phone calls are internet based and the connection often doesn’t work. And then I was transferred to yet another person - even more time on hold.

I know it's a long wait, but on the other hand - the whole country was on the lockdown, how were they meant to deliver any of my goods? Obviously, I wasn't expecting my package to be precisely shipped on 11th of Feb. Just think about the amount of orders they probably received before my and after. Anyways, once the shop resume working, I got a text saying that the delivery will be postponed and then a week after another text with an information about my package and the shipping estimate time.",0,4
IKEA,Don‘t order online!,"Don‘t order online! Ordered 3 weeks ago and my order was still not shipped. Unbelievable how a big global brand like IKEA is unable to deliver some smaller items via PostNL.Expected delivery date was 3 days ago, nobody showed up, no update regarding a new date. If they are unable to ship stuff they should just disable online ordering. Like seriously you don‘t need the stuff anymore 2 months later...",0,1
IKEA,Horrible,"Horrible. Order on 3 Mar for my office. 3/16 Still not delivered. Three attempts after office hours. Attempting a 4th time. They think that all orders are to be delivered to homes, while Home Depot, Toro, Fedex, UPS and Amazon have no trouble delivering.",0,1

I've never heard of someone who hates their job so much that they have to sigh after any concern i may have about my order and for every thing they ask me about my information.

Recently I had a click and collect which is free as I ordered over £100 but otherwise £5 charge! All in all, great products but needs improvements on their stocks.",0,4
IKEA,How difficult can it be to buy two…,"How difficult can it be to buy two office chairs from this company. Order placed online for two office chairs, arrive at the Tottenham store collection point on the 10th (50 mile round trip) but only one chair is available along with the arms for the other chair. The man handing over the delivery makes no mention of the fact that items are missing from my order. I take the one chair and additional set of arms home and call IKEA the next day to sort out the delivery for the missing chair - wait on hold for 50 mins whilst being tortured by ABBA played on a loop. Finally someone speaks to me and they confirm the missing chair will be delivered to my home address on the 16th, and a confirmation email is received from IKEA. Another email is received from IKEA today advising ""So, we're just getting in touch to remind you that your order 1176333133 is still waiting for collection today - and we want to make sure it gets safely to it's new home"". from their Tottenham Store. I ignore this email as I know the chair is being delievered from Peterborough on the 16th. Then later today I receive another email with an Invoice attached and the delivery date on the invoice is the 20/03/2021. I call IKEA Customer services to find out what I should do next; do I a) go to the Tottenham Store, b) wait in on the 16th as arranged or c) ignore a and b and wait in on the 20th. Customer services cant find any documentation on the system regarding the Tottenham pick up or the delivery date of the 16th and confirm I should wait in on the 20th. The only reason i ordered these two chairs in the beginning was because they were both available for collection on the 10th. If you want a stress free purchase do not buy any furniture online from IKEA unless of course you like listening to ABBA on loop and sitting on the floor until you furniture arrives. UPDATE: Ikea have just emailed me without warning confirming they have now cancelled the rest of my order. I now have one chair and two sets of chair arms I don't want.

IKEA,Slightly better than terrible..,Slightly better than terrible... online inventory is seldom accurate. Have made several trips to Schaumburg store to find the shelf empty. This goes back pre COVID so COVID not the root cause. Also your inventory planning leaves customers frustrated. 5 weeks ago purchased a child’s bed (sniglar) that requires Luroy boards to make functional. Luroy were out of stock but I bought the sniglar and the mattress thinking that Luroy would be available soon. A well run company would make sure customers could by all 3 components required to use the product. I’m 5 weeks in and looks like I’ll be waiting at least 4 more weeks. In the meantime my daughter is sleeping on the floor waiting for IKEA to get their act together. Every night I remind her that she is sleeping on the floor because IKEA is a poorly run company and she should always aim to be better when she starts working. Trying to make it a life lesson:),0,1

IKEA,Ikea is improving,"In January, I ordered IKEA but it didnt go well (the estimated delivery date was 4 weeks later) and I have to cancel my order after 5 weeks. The refund was fast, including the shipping cost. On 25th February, I went to IKEA website again and noticed that there was a change in their order page. I thought “why dont I give Ikea a second chance” so I ordered again and to my surprise, the estimated delivery day was 4th March, which means only 1 week waiting although my order was small and the shipping fee was only 2.99€ (big difference comparing to the previous order in January!). Order placed. On 2nd March, an email from Ikea announced that they are picking my order. On 4th March, nothing came but I already expected this would happen. On 5th March, an email from ikea came to say that due to peak time, my order will be delayed 2-5 days. On 10th March, they emailed me my order was sent and I got the Postnl track&trace link, I was quite shocked tbh 😂. Today (11th March), my order ACTUALLY CAME. Well done Ikea Barendrecht! This time is a very good shopping experience from Ikea although the delivery time was still a bit late. I guess after all the bad feedbacks Ikea is working hard to improve their service and they really have some good changes. The quality of Ikea products is good with reasonable price, they just have some weak points in their logistic department but they are fixing it. Once again, my compliment goes to the staffs of Ikea Barendrecht, Netherlands :)",0,5
IKEA,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Received a product without the assemble book and parts.After going around in circles to look for customer service online I noticed there is no way of getting hold of someone unless you want to ring the American Ikea. After giving up on customer service I managed to find the assemble guide on their website. They had a page to order missing parts I tried to add all the screws that were labeled on the guide book only to find out there's a limit to how much you can order.I AM NOW ORDERING THE PARTS OFF AMAZON, THANK YOU IKEA FOR BEING A GREAT HELP. NOTT THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLINE OR ANY DETAILS TO REACH THEM. So in future if you would like to order flat pack furniture try Wayfair instead.Edit - 3rd April 2021 After buying the missing screws and finding the assemble guide book on their website, I've realised they have given me the wrong panels to make the storage unit. We have tried to contact them but it's only a robot who repeats the same thing.This is terrible service and I can't believe I paid £40 service delivery charge for this. It's going on the next bonfire, at least I'll get more use out of it that way. I will never be using Ikea ever again. FYI - If you want a storage unit without having to pay for service delivery charge try Argos, they have some great furniture on there right now and next day delivery. - Wished I knew this before wasting my money on bloody Ikea.",0,1

I have sat on the phone for ages listening to ABBA (guess it could have been worse) and asking me to be respectful to their staff when I got to speak to them which was never. I live in Northern Ireland and to visit our IKEA shop would break Covid rules and as I haven't been in a shop for almost a year now that's not going to happen. so I am appalled that individuals like myself are being penalised in this way.

The delivery guys were complaining about the weight of the products I ordered and threatened to not bring it to my door! Most recently I ordered a Malm desk with the pull out part. Forgot how fragile the surface is. Any thing hard falling from a small height will cause damage. The foil construction is lightweight but also lightweight in sturdiness with a maximum 50kg load weight.

Customer service is now too lean—you’ll wait 15 to 45 minutes for help on special orders or even just basic questions. Quality still seems okay but AVAILABILITY and DELIVERY are still a freaking nightmare. In fact, availability is even more HORRENDOUS today than it was 6 months ago! What was amazing today was the MEGAPROPORTION of products that carried NOT AVAILABLE tags. When you drive an hour one-way expecting to buy items advertised online and they’re not available—or this is a good one: yes, it’s listed online but it’s a new product and we don’t have it yet! And when asked an associate what was going on, he admitted that they’d been struggling but they were hoping (hoping?!?!?) “to be back to normal sometime in June.” Freaking June???

No mention of any of this untill the last moment.Is the intention of withholding all this information until the last moment, that people will be too fed up to cancel and will simply accept such a dreadful mark up on the otherwise antipated cost of the goods.I regularly ship musical instruments and I have a good understanding of delivery charges.

We talked to customer service to return it. However, as the stores are closed, we cannot return them. We can only ship with fedex by courier. However, I had to pay for the shipping. Total nonsense !!! they send a product that smells disgusting, but I have to pay for their error. This is not about liking it or not, it will be a refund entirely due to the fault of the seller. Also, I do not understand why I am returning a product I bought online from the store. Their stores are also closed.

I've had orders canceled without knowledge of the fact they were canceled, waiting like a chump on hold for hours on end trying to sort things out. Requesting supervisor intervention, being told they will call me back followed be an email that supervisors are too busy to talk to the likes of me with my little concern. Yesterday was like any other Ikea customer service experience I've had. After waiting in a long return line a week ago to return an item purchased during a lockdown, I did not have the exact method of payment with me. I was told that they will put it on a gift card and that so I didn't have to wait in the long line again that I could just go to any checkout till and get the gift card placed on my original method of payment. Ha, suckered again!!! Went to a checkout till to attempt what I was told I could do just a short week ago and was very abruptly told no. Requested a supervisor, was told no. Requested the customer service supervisor to discuss the error that will now take even more time from my day, was told they were too busy. I informed the supervisor, that I would wait for the store manager to discuss. The store manager comes over with the so typical puffed-out chest syndrome to tell me the same thing. I requested that he assist me in performing the buyback of the gift card that I never wanted to begin with and he told me that I should wait in the hour-long line again!!! Naturally, I asked to speak to his boss, and he told me that he was the boss. I asked him, four times over if he was the boss of the store and if there was any above him I could speak with. He told me, that he was as high as there was... right now. So I dumbed it down for him asking him if there was a flow chart of Ikea and look at a flow chart for this store with the hierarchy, you would be at the top every day of the week? Finally, he conceded and told me he did indeed have a boss. I will call the store today, I'm sure to waste my breath and time as I will not get through to his majesty, and even if I could be told to screw off anyway.

Was promised a refund. Nothing materialised. Called again after a week and a half, was told the refund would be in our account 3 days later. Nothing materialised. Called them again and was told we were being fast tracked for a refund, would receive it in 5 days. Nothing materialised. Called them again after two weeks. Got about five seconds into the call and got cut off. Called them again, was put on hold while they ""read my case notes"", was on hold for half an hour. Each 5 calls meant 5 hours of listening to ABBA, fed lies, lies, lies, mixed with unending incompetence, AND they're still holding onto £496 of my money. Beyond furious.

IKEA,"Poor quality, meaningless warranties & horrible customer service","I purchased a mattress from the Amsterdam location of Ikea in 2018. We went for the slightly higher-end HOKASSEN model, which cost us around €500. After just two years, one side of the mattress started caving in - it appears the layer of foam around the mattress has separated from the core. I contacted Ikea's customer service team about this issue, as their website claims all mattresses come with a 25-year warranty.After weeks of slow communication and lots of back-and-forth with the customer service team on Facebook messenger, they finally connected me to the claims team. They then asked for additional information and photos, only to then reply back saying: ""We have started to process your enquiry and have thoroughly examined your photos. Considering this information, we have concluded that the damage stated is caused by circumstances that lie outside the product itself, e.g. daily use, impacts from dropping or falling, or incorrect use of the product.""So apparently ""daily use"" is considered a legitimate reason to void the warranty, even though the Terms and Conditions say nothing of the sort. According to the T&C: ""The claim must not be the result of incorrect use of the product, such as dropping it, knocking it over, using it for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, not maintaining it properly, or having it repaired by a third party.""I replied with this information and asked for further explanation from the services team and never received a reply. So after over a month of emailing about the damage with my mattress, I end up ghosted by Ikea. One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.For anyone thinking about buying a mattress from Ikea, be warned -- the mattresses are not made to last and the warranty is worth nothing more than the paper it's printed on.",0,1

IKEA,Not worth it. Go buy real furniture.,"We bought a SEKTION with all the drawers that go with it. Everything was fine until the last step of putting the doors on. The top hinge wont fit because of a manufacturing defect. So we spent the last two hours putting this together and now the door wont shut correctly. Do you think you're NASA with your fit tolerances? Do you think you're selling rockets to the moon? There is about an 1/8"" space the hinge needs and slip in, and there is about 1/32"" of a gap for it to fit.We broke the whole thing down and put the hinges on first, and tried to secure the top, but the top wont go on. So either the door sits ajar, or the top sticks up. I am furious and bleeding from under a fingernail right now. I tried to leave a review on your website, but that functionality doesn't even exist. I even took the time to create an account and used Google for help. We cant submit reviews any more, huh? By the looks of Trustpilot, there is a corporate reason for that.

IKEA,Not even worth 1 star,"It's a shame i have to give one star really as I don't think they even deserve that. I ordered some furniture for delivery and paid the £50 fee which, according to their customer service who I had to wait on hold for 45 minutes to speak to after my stuff didn't show up, is not to book a delivery. I always assumed that when I paid for a product called a delivery i was paying for an item to be delivered to me but according to ikea that is not the case, just what the £50 fee is for then, i still have no idea.The customer service representative i spoke to was one of the rudest and most belligerent people I have ever had the misfortune of speaking to. Taking pleasure in making customers cry is apparently their main job as it definitely wasn't to find a solution to the fact my items ""were never put on the truck"". He refused multiple requests from me to be passed over to another customer service rep and told me that if I insisted he would simply hang up the call. After 45 minutes of listening to the atrocity that is Abba compressed to play through a phone line, you can understand why that made me even more upset. He also informed he was the only one who handled complaints and that he was refusing to put in my complaint. This was, of course, a lie. I eventually managed to convince him to rebook my delivery for a few days later but on ending the call, he simply cancelled the entire order instead.I then got to spend even more time on hold to speak to another customer service representative who did manage rebook my delivery but it really makes you question just the kind of business ikea is running where these are the kind of people representing their business.I still received no details about my deliver and even after a call at 6pm the night before the second attempt the customer services could not confirm my items would arrive the next day. They did eventually arrive but with zero information from ikea.In total that weekend i spent over two hours on hold waiting for ikea customer service, I assume this is down to the sheer number of people they have failed who are calling to try and get what they have paid for. I am nothing but disgusted with the way ikea have handled my business and will not be using them in the future and I suggest you do not either. I have made multiple complaints and am yet to receive an apology, although they did eventually refund my £50 not-delivery fee.",0,1
IKEA,Do not order an IKEA dishwasher,"I ordered a Finputsad dishwasher (""which?"" gave it good reviews). They didn't deliver when they said they would, but did deliver a few days later.When it arrived, some of the parts (the door attachment brackets) were faulty. I contacted customer services to try to get some spares, but they don't stock spares for their dishwashers! They messed me around for a week: The first customer service person I spoke to arranged for a whole replacement dishwasher to be delivered, with a note attached that they were only meant to deliver the loose parts. This order was later mysteriously cancelled without informing me. When I noticed that the order was cancelled, I contacted customer services again. This time they told me, after searching around for a bit, that the dishwasher was manufactured by whirlpool, and that I should contact whirlpool directly for spare parts.I phoned whirlpool on the number they gave me, and they told me they don't know anything about the dishwasher in question and don't recognise any of the numbers I read out from the service sticker.I phoned IKEA again. This time they said they would contact whirlpool themselves and get them to contact me once they'd worked things out (Still not what I actually want: I just wanted some replacement parts, not to chat to a whirlpool employee).At this point, I was really regretting ordering this dishwasher. Even assuming they managed to rectify the original order, who wants a dishwasher where the manufacturer denies it exists and nobody sells spare parts for it? I phoned IKEA back to request to return it. They tried to charge me a £25 collection fee to pick it up. According to them, a faulty dishwasher is classed as, ""customer changed their mind"", unless whirlpool have first visited and tried to fix it (which they aren't going to do because they don't believe it exists).If you're looking for a dishwasher, I would look for a reputable brand who support their products and sell spares, not a reseller like IKEA.If you're looking for anything else, I would still suggest avoiding IKEA, as ordering and arranging delivery was a horrible nightmare.",0,1

IKEA,Disaster Kitchen Process,"We began our Ikea kitchen design last October and it is now mid February. After purchasing the parts needed to build our kitchen, we have been met with a series of errors and crappy compromises. First off, we have an average sized kitchen and ordered basic cabinets and they still never got the order straight. We paid $79 for an official measurement and that measurement was incorrect. The excuse was new staff.... After 3 deliveries of random goods, delivered to the sidewalk in front of our house, we also had to go buy more parts and return wrong parts 9 times within a month and a half. All during a Global pandemic and no phone payments or orders taken. We had to travel south 40 minutes each time, go into the corn maze and pay and then drive 5 more miles east to their warehouse for pick up. Our final plan shows the upper cabinets going to the ceiling but when they were building it out we were told that was not an option/not part of the plan? We used Traemand because supposedly they know how to build Ikea designs but they proved to be a huge disappointment and were a integral part of the confusion with all the conflicting parts we ended up with. The final straw was that they built one whole side of our kitchen incorrectly. We could not open our fridge because the wall oven and microwave area was too close to the fridge door. Keep in mind we gave the Ikea designers and Traemand all appliance cut out dimensions in the design and build phase. The only resolution Ikea had was to have Traemand move our cabinets on that wall 2 inches to the right. This required that our countertop on that side be removed. American Marble works in conjunction with Ikea kitchens so we used them. Ikea would not agree to anything unless we came into the store once again and pay an additional $1300 dollars for a new countertop, in the event they could not use the original one. What could we do? we were stuck with appliances that could not be installed! We paid thinking they could reuse the piece since it was a simple cut that only needed to be shortened 2 inches on one side. Traemand came back out and all fits somewhat but the appliances still look crowded on that side so not aesthetically pleasing. While waiting for American Marble to reinstall, they took forever to get back to us, insisted on a $225 measure appointment for that minor adjustment that could have been done on site. When I finally called and asked what the delay was they said the countertop for that side needed to be remade and it would be another 2 weeks. At this point I lost it. I questioned why they needed to replace that piece and they said they didn't know (I'm just a scheduler). I guess it's easy to just press that button and buy when the expense is on another person. After sending a nasty email to the trio (Ikea, Traemand and America Marble), I was told by American Marble that they could actually reuse that countertop piece after all. Still 2 weeks to wait for a half hour install. I still haven't gotten a response from Ikea. Also, the Traemand carpenters had to Jerry rig an area on that messed up side so when Best Buy came to install the wall oven and microwave with trim kit, no go. It doesn't fit. Traemand excuse was we didn't use Ikea appliances. Funny appliances are all standard sizes and we weren't told any of that when we gave them the cut out dimensions over 3 months ago. We since hired a Task Rabbit to come and resolve their screw up. I can't wait to have to go back into Ikea and try to get a refund for that additional countertop we paid for, The moral of this long story is you get what you pay for! I chose Ikea because I love the modern look and the price seemed good. In the end, it would have been better to see out a more professional, quality cabinet designer and builder. God knows what I will be paying for therapy and blood pressure medication in the future!",0,1
IKEA,Hopeless system - failed purchase,"Ordered Friday for collection 2-8pm Saturday. Saturday came & went with no notification. Email DID arrive on Sunday afternoon - after the store had closed. Went along Monday evening, rang the designated number, entered order number, received text confirming ""please wait til we text you"". After an hour went to talk to assistant - who called indoors. Our order had been cancelled because we hadn't collected during the ordered time. ""But you didn't tell us it was ready until the following day, after the store had closed."" Order had apparently been cancelled & we would be refunded 3-5 working days later. IKEA's systems are hopeless. Cancelling an order because we didn't collect it even though they didn't tell us it was ready until the following day is worse than useless. Texting us when we'd called on arrival to tell us to wait (when they'd already cancelled the order!) is even more worse than useless. Don't bother with IKEA during lockdown, people.",0,1

IKEA,today I had the absolute worst customer…,"today I had the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. I'll start at the beginning...we just built a house and need to furnish it- spent a few hundred bucks last week on 2 pax wardrobes and a dresser- purchased them online. We liked the product so I decided to go buy a unit that would cover my master bedroom wall. Did my research online and went into the store to confirm my ideas and to buy it to bring it home. Talked to the 2 sales girls, one was totally not interested and brushed me off to someone else. The second sales girl talked me out of a wardrobe system and suggested i buy a living room set instead, it had drawers and it would leave an open space for our bedroom tv. I told her the most important thing was to be sure it was on site as I have very limited time and I needed my crew to build and furnish 5 bedrooms, a living room and a rec. room within 7 days before I go back to work. I needed to get it there asap and didn't have time to waste. After going with her recommendation and assurances all items were downstairs and there was ample stock, I left to go get it. Surprize surprize, many of the framework wasn't even in stock. Changed it all to white instead of black and after getting those carts filled, they too were short on stock, one frame, 13 drawers and 2 doors. After 7 hours, and starving (was supposed to only be an hour- 2 max, I started loosing it and spoke with a lovely manager who was very helpful but it was still a mess as now I had to come back tomorrow to get another frame and had to get a delivery of the rest of the items march 4th. Extremely upset and starving, I was so frazzled, I put the incorrect pin in for my card (was the only card I had brought) My bank is over an hour away and it was not 830pm so I was unable to go to the bank to fix my card and make it back to the store in time. My phone was out of power and I was incredibly stressed out. I asked the manager to please not put my stuff away and explained what happened and that I would be back first thing in the morning to pay for it without any issues. The bill was just shy of 1800. which I was very happy with, but it was 4 carts and took hours and hours to get together let alone the stress I endured getting it together. She had the audacity to complain that she had been working for 13 hours and she absolutely refused to keep my order together for me. I asked her just to hold it (not put it away) as It took me soo long to gather it and she said NO! She knew what I went through to gather it all (I explained it to her) and she still said NO! I am disgusted and absolutely IRATE! How could you possibly treat your customers that way after what you put me through in order to get it! HOW COULD YOU!!! Ikea, you don't deserve good/loyal customers! I glad I discovered how awful you truly are before i furnished my whole house. I would like to hear how you could possibly justify the way you treated me. Shame on you! Please respond",0,1

IKEA,Ikea charging customers and not delivering for months,"I know that there are many posts on the topic but I want to share my experience and warn people. I am placed in New York City. I had read about Ikea problems in the US, but I foolish thought that in January 2021things would be better. I was wrong.I placed an order for 4 items (Finnala couch and Ottoman, Micke desk, and wall mirrror) on January 20, 2021. It took me weeks to manage and place this order as before everything was out of stock. Delivery date was February 22, 2021. A long time, but I decided to go for it. Yesterday, suddenly the delivery date was changed to March 22, 2021. An entire month later. I contacted them through the phone. Hours only to be given contradictory information. I talked to a manager that basically blamed everything and anything in the world as not to explain what really was going on. Today, the delivery date was changed again to APRIL. I called them again. Frustrating phone call where the ""manager"" I talked to dared to be very disrespectful. Again, no answers. They keep saying they know nothing and there is nothing they can do as if it is normal to charge people and then not deliver the merchandise. I could explain in more details the conversation with them, but I feel drained.These are hard times for everyone. It is hard to find the money to place these orders so that we can at least be comfortable in the apts we are stuck in. Ikea fraudulently sells items they do not have and keeps their customers' money for months, and know they can get away with it because they are this global potency. Then, they blame their failure on ""things being hard"", like they are your local bakery. This company is disgusting and I wish I had the resources or peace of mind to actually take action against them.Please be aware that even if items are said to be in stock and you pay for them and a delivery date is set, they actually don't know if they have those items and the delivery date will keep being changed, month after month.",0,1

Finally the missing product is shipped, another month goes by (By now you should have sorted things out) and even this is worse, it should have arrived the 4th of feb. But I only got it today. This means I have waited for over 2 months to get my full order and what even makes it worse is the your service really sucks. Sorry for the words but I can understand the logistics hassle from selling almost everything offline to online but what I can not understand is the lack in service and response. And also the quality of response is bad and caused a lot of extra messages to get to a proper solution.Just wow Ikea, you really messed it up and have lost a lot of faith.",0,1
IKEA,Incredibly Poor Customer Service,"Worst customer service experience of my life. Can't believe the poor processes and service considering the size of IKEA.Looking at the reviews below seems to be a common problem. Won't use them again after this, appreciate COVID would have caused changes by other companies have adapted. Trying to return an item and 8 calls later (after being on hold for 50 minutes on average on each) get told different things each time and still no closer to solving the problem.",0,1

IKEA,Worst customer service call ever!,"My IKEA order did not arrive on the scheduled day. No email to say it was delayed. As I thought the delay was Covid related, I waited a month before ringing them. I had the worst ever customer service experience ever. There was a TV blaring in the background and I couldn’t hear the agent. When I asked him to turn it down he said he couldn’t, that he lives with other people and could not do anything about it. I could not hear his explanation for the non delivery, and I got a reschedule for 10 days time, same as if I ordered today. I told him the call quality was unacceptable but think I was wasting my breath! I just hope the order will arrive. I had no Idea IKEA standards were so shoddy. So unprofessional.",0,1
IKEA,Non existent customer service and everything is difficult.,"Always loved Ikea however recently the service is beyond diabolical. The app leads you to believe you've placed an order but never materialises. Placed the order online and then had to cancel due to an error my end. Did so within 10 mins but I never received the email confirming it was cancelled. I tried ringing, emailing, tweeting, Instagraming.... but nothing. Absolutely no way to contact this company!!! The money was still taken 3 days later, I never collected the items and still yet to get my refund over 14 days later. To add insult to injury I re-placed the order and when we went to collect, we waited over an hr for our collection. I know you can't really plan for a pandemic but it really is a mess.",0,1

To date, no refunded of £208 and instead have kept it. Customer service unavailable, chat unavailable, emails receive no response. Don’t trust IKEA with your money folks. You have been warned!

IKEA,The click and collect service was awful,"The click and collect service was extremely poor. I received my text to say my goods were ready to collect, I arrived called the phone number and was given a bay number. No one understood the bay system and their were no staff to assist. Staff were yelling numbers at customers who didn’t really know what was going on, and therefore it ended up being a bit of a mess. 1 hour and 30 minutes went past and still no sign of this order I was told to collect. (I have spoken with staff, they are aware) I get a phone call from the IKEA office saying their has been a problem with my order and to go and wait in the car, which we did...20 minutes later I received another phone call to say your order is ready, so we returned back to bays, and we received the order. The IKEA team had really given me no reason to trust their ability at this point so I double checked all my items, and to my not surprised self one of my boxes for a set of drawers were missing, we went back to the bays and then had to wait another 30 minutes for the final box. A total of 2 hours and 20 minutes to collect items. I understand it’s difficult times during the current situation but if you can’t create a simple process that works for customers then frankly don’t bother, and also it would be nice to give your customers some shelter (create a waiting area that is still outside but under the lip) whilst waiting for 2 hours in the stinking cold during a life threatening pandemic. 👌",0,1
IKEA,It's surprising that a large,"It's surprising that a large, international company that seems to work hard to portray a good image, could have one of the worst customer service departments. Several items were missing from an order I placed on line for delivery to my home. I reported the problem immediately and was assured that I would be refunded (with a credit to my original form of payment) for the missing items plus the delivery charge. I received an email advising me that the credit had been issued. 12 days later, it has still not posted to my account. And calls and emails to customer service have done nothing. No one will provide a transaction number for the credit. All they will tell me is that the credit was issued and it's not their problem that I have not received it. Isn't it amazing they can get a charge on your account instantly but they can't seem to get a credit/refund through within 12 days??!!",0,1

IKEA,Spend less on pretentious ads and more on serving your customers,"I ordered a screen from IKEA which was due to be delivered last Saturday 13 February, between 2 and 6. On Friday 12th Feb, I received a text confirming delivery. At 2.45 on Saturday, I received another text saying it wasn’t going to be delivered that day but 15 days later, February 28th. I also got an email confirming my order.I phoned IKEA and was told that a truck had broken down and up to 70 deliveries were affected. So, what did IKEA do? Hire additional transport to ensure the goods were delivered? No. Prioritise my delivery? No. Send a taxi with my delivery? No. IKEA did absolutely nothing other than give me ‘the next available slot’ for delivery, which was convenient for them, but did nothing for me as it’s over two weeks late. I now have to wait a further 15 days for my delivery because IKEA are too stingy / incapable / uncaring / miserable / disorganised to arrange transport. You can make your own choice, I’d use them all.Interestingly, Customer Service did make a virtue of sending me a €30 voucher for my inconvenience. We are in lockdown and delivery alone is €35, so even then I’m at a loss should I decide to make a purchase.Perhaps if IKEA spent more money on customer service and delivery and less on ridiculously pretentious ads, they might have provide better service and have a better reputation.",0,1

IKEA,Ikea Edmonton Branch,"Ikea Edmonton Branch. Dining protocols during pandemic. We like eating at Ikea, and during this pandemic, guidelines and protocols are updated, which is appreciated. Nowadays, you have to sign in and you will be assigned a table number. The only thing we noticed, is that, the tables being used are mostly congregated in the same area so, out of curiosity we asked the staff on why the tables by the window side are not being utilized, his answer was that there is a bird in the area. We asked for the manager and the manager said there is, yes, a magpie in the window area that is why they did not serve on those tables. Maybe the magpie is infected? or will cause chaos? and people will panic? or maybe poop on your meal? or fly? or land? or sing? we were unfortunately assigned on a table that everybody has to pass by us, front and back and yes, I felt unsafe and rush my meal. As I was gathering my plate to put them on the tray area, a lady staff asked us if we were done to get the table number, obviously waiting.So i didn't hear any chirp, maybe the bird was asleep.

IKEA,Threatening letters because of a refund!?,"I purchased my kitchen from IKEA Berlin last year. Two items from the order were missing, but I was able to replace them at Bauhaus, so I asked IKEA for a refund. I never heard back from them. After 2 months of replies without any response, I filed a claim through PayPal (which I had used to make the order) with full documentation. PayPal completed the refund on IKEA's behalf. (It was about €100.) In January, I received a written demand from IKEA that I pay them the money I was refunded. I emailed IKEA and PayPal about this. IKEA told me to ignore the letter as they had made a mistake. Today, I received a second demand threatening me with legal action if I do not transfer the ~€100 to their bank immediately. I have no idea what to do as clearly one department is not talking to another. I'll give them 2 stars in lieu of 1 because the quality of IKEA products is at least reliable and consistent, and because I know that 2-star reviews are taken more seriously than 1-star reviews. But this situation is unbelievable. I had a €120 gift card for IKEA and I'm tempted to tell them to take the gift card value as ""payment"" because I will not be shopping with them again.",0,2

Anytime I call them, they always give the excuse that their computers are not working and this has happened the two more times I've called them. I told them that I want to speak to a manager. They said they'd connect me to one and left me on hold for more than 20mins. I just want my refund. That this happened at a corporation such as IKEA is very appalling.

The representative I spoke to earlier today at NAL assured me that it is their policy to call when the van is 30-40 minutes away and then again at 5 minutes. In sync with my prior terrible NAL experience, I got ONLY the 5 minute call in which the driver told me he ""could not wait"". I do not live there and took their word on the guarantee of a 30 minute notice. This did not happen. And then the driver was rude. Totally unprofessional! Shop elsewhere at all costs!",0,1

I order $3000 worth of kitchen cabinets some from store inventory and most from warehouse. The warehouse delivers but the store cancels my store order. No notification, I just learn this from contractor who alerts me that items were never delivered. He tells me store order cancelled by IKEA. Here's the outrageous part and where a class action suit could be successful. IKEA does not credit my card when THEY cancel. No. They make me wait on the phone for an hour and ten minutes to get to a rep who then develops a case number for ""request for refund"" and says it may get processed in a few days.Sorry but if a store -- not the customer -- cancels and order it has an obligation to immediately charge back the card. It is totally unreasonable to expect the customer to have to fix this overcharge issue. In my case it was over 500 bucks so I waited and pursued. Many smaller purchasers likely do not bother.My guess is that many people do not ever get their refunds given the hassle of having to chase for it. Hence their is likely a class of people who have been screwed. Lawyers... there is an opportunity here I am quite sure.",0,1

Once home I opened one and saw it was a matress cover. Was upset because I matched the number of the item to the number of what I thought were pillows in the rack while I was in the store. There were no sales persons about to help me know for sure what I was buying. So, today I went back to return these items and was told sorry, no we won't take it back because there is hair on the one that had been opened. I was surprised to hear that because something like that has never happened to me while returning something to a store. So I called customer service to see if I could get anywhere with them and was told by the representative to take the hair off using Scotch tape. I was dismayed by what he expected me to do and told him so! He then schooled me saying ""would you try to return clothes with hair on them?"" And he spoke over me while I was trying to talk. Now, had I purchased it online and returned it through the mail, there would have been no questions asked it would have been returned without an issue. Because I went to the store and the item was visualized by the clerk I was denied the return. My opinion of IKEA has now dwindled. No more shopping there for me.

She said she’d make a note of that. So, I have a cushionless ottoman and a $10 refund on the way in 7-10 days. Seriously, they are happy to charge me for non existing products, but getting a replacement or a refund is totally a pain.",0,1

Paid to click and collect 3 wardrobes all in stock December 2020 NO only shelves and doors on collection (hired a van). 3 promised delivery’s all lies, lies, lies, Countless hours on the phone more lies. Still IKEA Webb site says available on line but get to available click and collect or delivery slots and it just goes back to the start over and over with no explanation why? Almost 2 months now with just doors and shelves but no wardrobes. Asked if we could return the doors and matching draws (I’d taken out of the packing cos we had been promised a delivery for the rest) No you can not IKEA said. you have opened the item. IKEA absolutely disgusting, appalling and lies. Worst of all they blamed all this and the lies on the pandemic. Shame on you IKEA.",0,1
IKEA,Short sighted policy will hurt business.,"I attempted to return a gift that I did not want/need. IKEA would not accept it for a refund nor an instore credit. Dumb move. Now, intead of a happy customer, you have a FORMER customer. And, as you should know, a happy customer tells a few people, but an unhappy one tells A LOT of people. Further, if I had received an instore credit, chances are when I returned to use that credit, I would have spent more. NOT a smart policy.",0,1

I hope she reads this. She was horrible. I'm still shaken and angry by our encounter, because her behavior was so unexpected. I just have one thing tosay to you F&$# you!!!! I will never order anything from IKEA Canada again, and I will make sure that everybody I meet from now on will never do that. I hate you.

IKEA,WORST WEBSHOP EVER!!! Slechtste webshop ooit,"What a horrific experience ordering online from Ikea. They clearly do not know what they are doing online. I ordered three simple and small stock items, which are always available at my local Ikea, 15,5 km away. At the end of the ordering process I was told that my order was to be delivered in three weeks (!!!!!!!). I wasn't in a hurry, the items were way cheaper that similar ones on regular online stores, so I took the chance. After that it became quiet. I didn't get a message on the status, no updates appeared when I checked the order status on the Ikea site. Nothing. After 2,5 weeks I received the message that ""unfortunately"" my order was delayed by 2-3 days. Nonetheless, the order status remained unchanged and the expected delivery date also didn't change. 5 days after the (still expected) initial order date was due, I received a message that my order was about to depart the Ikea warehouse. The day after I received the message form the local mail service that they received my package and that they would deliver it the next day, which they did. It took exactly 4 weeks to travel the whole (virtual) 15,5 km, a whopping 22 meters per hour!I received the items in a huge box, which was filled for 95% with packaging materials. Not really environmentally friendly either.WARNING: NEVER ORDER ONLINE FROM IKEA!!!! (Unless you don't mind to wait 4 weeks for delivery)",0,1

IKEA,"IKEA Ireland - Delivery never arrived after receiving text, no contact from IKEA","I ordered items on 1st January 2021 that I had tried to order since October 2020. In store they said they’d be in stock on 1st December 2020 but they were not. I checked online every day and finally they were in stock on 1st January so I ordered and they took my money in full. They said they’d be delivered today 30th January 2021.I then received a text message yesterday, 29th January 2021 to say my order would be delivered today between 11.30am and 4.30pm. It said on the order confirmation email that I would receive an update today to say between what hour it would come and I waited in all day for the delivery and no update from IKEA. I rang IKEA at the end of my four hour delivery window and was told it was ‘out for delivery’ but the delivery truck was delayed a further hour and they’d get them to ring me. I waited until 5.30pm and rang again to be told the items were not only, NOT out for delivery, but they are no longer in stock and she has no idea when they are coming back in stock and can’t even tell me when they will come. So they have my money but do I even have an order. So they clearly send automated text messages to tell people of deliveries when they haven’t even processed the orders. They don’t then have the courtesy to tell customers the order wasn’t processed and isn’t being delivered, the contrary is true they send a text message with very specific delivery times. They then lied on the phone. Most professional delivery services can tell if things are out for delivery and communicate this to customers. Most companies don’t take money in full for out of stock items.Was it even in stock when I ordered or did they allocate my items to someone else. Can they not update me by phone, email or text in the meantime (a month) to say they do not have the items.Customer service the first time clearly lied and on the second call was unapologetic and cannot even give me a date when my items will be delivered. Someone may contact me by email when they get a chance she explained!!Don’t hide behind covid for such poor communication and customer service.Why send the “out for delivery” misleading text to infuriate customers and make them stay in all day for non existent deliveries.",0,1

However, I didn't receive any contact from the delivery team and nothing arrived on the day. I then received a lovely message the following morning from customer service apologising and explaining a computer error had occurred. She gave me a new delivery date (a couple days later) with an option to call and change if this was not convenient. I received updates mid morning on the delivery day to advise of how many drops were before mine, then a call from the delivery driver 5 mins before delivery. The two delivery chaps were very friendly and efficient and the boxes arrived in perfect condition. After reading recent negative reviews I felt compelled to leave a positive review. Although there was a miscommunication to start with the problem was dealt with quickly and the customer care was excellent.Delivery was within one week.

Some of the order wasn't delivered and I had a dreadful job trying to obtain a refund, I spent an hour and a half trying to get through on the phone then they wanted to keep the delivery charge of £25 even though the order had been only part delivered. I eventually resolved this. Then foolishly ordered another lot of furniture with a lamp that has arrived today and the lamp is smashed. I CANNOT get through to Ikea at all.

I ordered a sofa online and within less than 24hrs I called to cancel that order and place a new order because I realized the dimensions of the original order wouldn’t fit the space. They canceled the original order and then charged me again for the new order. It’s been two weeks and I still haven’t received my refund for the first order which was over $700. I called the company to find out why it’s taking so long and the associate claimed that they only have one office to handle all of the claims from customers for the entire North America continent. She said my cousin hasn’t even begun to process! Should take 30 days before it’s even processed and then another week or so to see it in my account. What bs is that!? So upset and disappointed in their lack of care for their customers. No excuse for such a large multi million dollar company to be so slow.,0,1

Nothing easy in Covid-19 lockdown, so getting Ikea order together has been difficult due to availability and deliveries (has been on-going for 2+ months). Yvonne took over the case yesterday and came up with a slight change to the design which replaced parts which are unavailable with available parts. Design is almost exactly the same, no negative impact and the order/delivery problem is solved. On top of all that Yvonne is so chipper and helpful.

When the parcel delivery was finally carried out the shipment was missing 2 packages also with pieces that are needed to build the furniture (delivered earlier by truck). The shipment was also missing some smaller orders and they have not issued any credit note for this.

IKEA,"Oh my god fam, you need to chill.","Towards the end of December I ordered a Hemnes bookcase and Hemnes Chest of Drawers for delivery for early January. Whilst I thought the £40 delivery was a little steep, I didn’t mind paying due to the current pandemic. On 4th January (my delivery date), only the bookcase arrived. The delivery driver assured me this would be noted and the chest of drawers sent at a further date. Two days later I had still heard nothing and checked the website. It told me both items had been delivered. Every time I rang (after eventually finding the number) it told me the lines were too busy, no one responded to my Facebook post, my tweet or my emails. Eventually I got through to someone who explained that the system hadn’t been updated and they would resolve this. I was given a new delivery date for later that week. On the new delivery date, only 2 out of the 3 boxes were delivered. Again the driver told me it would be resolved as the missing box was the one with the tools and instructions to build. Again I had to try several times to contact somebody and when I got through they apologised and re-arranged delivery. The day came and went and nothing came. I rang back, they apologised again and arranged a new date. The day came and went and nothing came. On ringing this time, I was getting a little tired of having two boxes in my house unable to do anything with them and being given false promises with no compensation. The customer service person I spoke to informed me that the item was now fully out of stock, despite the website saying they had it in stock. He told me there was nothing I could do, I wasn’t entitled to compensation or a refund and I would just have to wait. When I told him this wasn’t acceptable his reply was “oh my god fam, you need to chill out”. To say I was wholly unimpressed with this disrespectful response is an understatement. I asked to speak to someone higher and he told me he could transfer me through but the managers never answered nor responded to complaints?!? When I mentioned that I would also be asking for a copy of the recording of the call which IKEA so kindly inform customers take place, his tone changed completely. However, two months later after the original booking I am still without the final box of the chest of drawers, out of pocket and without any form of compensation. Despite sending three formal complaint emails, I have heard nothing back from them. Shocking from beginning to end. I would 100% recommend to not use their service as I found it to be absolutely shambolic and disrespectful.",0,1

Went on Friday and after a rigmarole of phoning a number and keying in my order number ( they never make it easy) surprise surprise my rug had been put back into stock and there was no way I could collect. Apparantly according to the admittedly apologetic member of staff you only have 24 hours to collect. She told me that it was stated on my order, except it’s not. On the way back I had a text from ikea saying Thankyou for collecting your order! Of course there is no direct number to contact the store.No refund either have just checked my account. They must think I’ve collected. Just rang customer services, it cut off as recorded message says they’re busy. No rug, 32 mile round trip and taken £30 from me and I’ve had a lot of frustration.

IKEA,FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE: Croydon Ikea Bargain Corner - LABEL ID: 000000606162892.,I ordered a table from Ikea Bargain Corner Croydon on Gumtree. I was nervous about paying over the phone via their PCIPAL as I was worried incase the payment phone call might be scammers but the Customer Service Personnel - Gavin - was very understanding and patient and did everything necessary (including asking me to email & call main number whilst still on the phone with me) to reassure me that it was really Ikea.Collection was also a dream. They had well labelled separate parking space for Gumtree Customers and the collection was completed within 15minutes of us arriving there. Everything was done contactless as well.I have read some of the reviews on here about items ordered being out of stock after payment had been taken and I understand how frustrating that might be but I will urge that we remain a bit understanding with them in the face of the Covid situation. I will encourage you to check their Ikea Bargain Corner on Gumtree in your area as they only put items that are actually available up on there. The best bit for me was that the item I bought was £50 off the actual price simply because it was an ex display item.,0,5
IKEA,i hade enough  with  trieng to call to…,"i hade enough with trieng to call to resolve i have never seen more worse service than this before in my whole life. i have an issue with my mattress and i keep calling about that...first 2 times they said i have to wait for a call back within 48 ahours but they never called back, and finally today i got such a rude person on the line saying i talk too fast and he can't understand me and disconnected the call !!!!! i had enough with this horrible service never thought such a big company will give such a bad service and fals guarantee of 25 years!!!! what a shame to provide such an extremely bad service like this and to have such a rude agents on the phone. a big shame. i wish i checked the reviews first about ikea service on Internet before i made the purchase its so very negative you have everywhere very low rate you should have some shame and if you don't give any support then also don't say that the mattress has 25 years guarantee as its so fake! i never had to be so rude before like this but am so extremely mad at the moment because of the disgusting cowboy that refused to help me and disconnected the call and i think you definitely deserve it! when i called i heard first they don't accept rudeness or getting aggressive! if you was a good company with goid service you will not get many upset people! the fact you having this record on the phone is for me a big evidence that you provide extremely poor service so before teaching others to behaive please look first to your bad service!",0,1
IKEA,Worthless Warranty!,"I purchased a Stockholm leather sofa June 2020. However, within 6 months the leather started to deteriorate on one cushion. A technician was sent out from Ecomaster and advised us that the cushion would be replaced or repaired. However, IKEA send an email closing our case as they say the technician advised it was due to damage. IKEA would not provide the technicians report or photos, forcing us to initiate a Subject Access Request to pursue further. Very disappointing!",0,1

IKEA,What a disappointment,"Ordered 3 items, £40 delivery charge for only 2 items to turn up. Spent an hour on the phone waiting for customer service to pick up, I was then promised the missing item on the Friday/ Saturday and have had nothing since. Thankfully it was the cheapest item and I will purchase elsewhere but I’m horrified that such a big company should have such poor after sales. I wish I’d read the reviews first. Needless to say that I doubt I’ll be buying from them again. It’s just not worth it in the long run.",0,1
IKEA,I have ordered a sink for my kitchen at IKEA,"I have ordered a sink for my kitchen at the beginning of month, with the delivery date of 15 of January, today 20 of January nothing received. I have managed to reach the customer service and have been asked to wait for another 5 days, so in total 10 days have to be waited until they can escalate it and see how they can help me. That is ridiculous... it surprises me that IKEA being such big company cannot organize simple things that are easily arranged by other stores. As for me, there are definitely issues within their supply chain management and with management team in general, which I think were impotent in the face of changes which were obviously coming for a long time already.",0,1
IKEA,I had a very bad experience with IKEA…,"I had a very bad experience with IKEA customer service. 2 days after I ordered I realise I ordered one item twice. I called customer service (>30mins waiting) to cancel the order and the lady said that she can't do it for me and that I should reject the item when it's delivered to me. So I waited several days until the shipment arrive to do what she told me to do. However the IKEA delivery guy refused to do that, saying that he doesn't have a proof of return if we do it like that and he asked us to again call customer service to pick the product up. We had to call customer service again (another >30mins waiting) to make appointment to pick up. The customer service guy said the item will be picked up the next day, but it didn't happen. So we had to call again (another >30mins waiting) and the guy on the line said he would make sure this time the item will be picked up and he will call me the next day to check it it really happened or not. The next day no pick up, no call. Then we call customer for the third time (yes, again >30mins waiting). This time the customer service person said she has found the problem and FOR SURE the next day the item will be picked up. two days later and guess what? the item is still there. What should I do now???????!!!!!!!",0,1

IKEA,IKEA Return Desk Nightmare,"In order to return item back to IKEA you have to register online before you get called to the return desk clerk. Apparently IKEA management believes it can handle the flow of return items better. And yes, there are a lots of people waiting to be called. It took me an hour this morning to get my turn. Does it tell you something about the product they sell? Also, I didn't know I had to register with IKEA for returns. I had my phone with me, so was able to do it right there. It took some effort to register because IKEA WiFi wasn't responsive. But how about people who don't have their phone with them? Must be tough luck!With all this, I wonder if I ever come back to shop in this store again.",0,1

IKEA,IKEA has The Worlds Worst Customer Service,"After placing an order and paying for it online to pick up in the store, the store does not have the item. This happened three times over the course of a month for the same item in the same store! It's hit or miss, mostly miss, to get in touch with customer service on the phone. Ikea automated system refused to connect an average of 3 out of my 4 calls. I called over a dozen times. After spending over two hours on calls and trying to call, I got IKEA to agree to a $25 and $30 gift card as compensation for my misery of dealing with IKEA. They have refused to pay them under reference #'s they issued them under. IKEA is so sleazy in how they handle their customers. And customer service doesn't do want they say they will do to help a customer. Just a repeatedly awful time every time i have to interact with IKEA.",0,1

IKEA,Why can't Ikea design drawers…,"Why can't Ikea design drawers properly?? My latest drawer disappointment is with a Malm 6-drawer chest of drawers, where the metal support bar (part 123833) is fitted to the front of the drawer in a REALLY POOR way: it has no strength to prevent the back of the drawer from bowing outwards, and can easily jump off the screw which is supposed to hold it in place - at which point it drops down and jams the whole drawer shut. Most of Ikea's designs work really well - how did this one find its way into a mainstream product?",0,1

IKEA,They should stick to meatballs,"Had a linmon desk delivered which was smashed on the corner. I spent an hour on the phone arranging a replacement and had a delivery date confirmed. It never came, so had to spend another hour on the phone arranging a new delivery. This also never came and have had to arrange another supposed date which meant another hour and 20mins on the phone. 3hours 20mins on the phone so far and still no desk.I was offered a voucher of compensation (yet to materialise) after the first failed delivery but I have been told I will not be offered anything else. I'm pretty sure offering a customer a voucher doesnt entitle a company to then repeatedly fail in their contract of service.I was told my replacement desk is being picked and packed at Sheffield but they cannot provide a reason why they repeatedly fail to pick my item. It must be very busy in the empty shop....",0,1
IKEA,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. We ordered an £80 headboard and since we were getting it delivered added a £5 shelf to the order too. The delivery was @£30-40. The Shelf was delivered but not the headboard (the thing we actually wanted/needed) no communication no way to contact them because there was such high demand (you are a multinational company, pitiful excuse). 2-3 months later we finally get an email telling us they are refunding us for the item only. I am still waiting for a response regarding delivery as we clearly would not have spent £30-40 on delivery for a £5 item. Pathetic.",0,1
IKEA,Exceedingly poor customer service.,"In all my months of online shopping, IKEA is the only company who have poor customer service. I rang them last week about an item and was told it should be back in stock within 2-5 days; I had been trying to order it for 4 days before phoning them. (I wasted 30 mins waiting for an answer) 10 days later still not in stock so I removed it from my list and ordered anyway. It wasn’t until I’d paid that a message appeared say delivery would be 27th February!!!! 5 weeks away. No other company waits till payment has gone through before giving you a date option. Exceedingly poor customer service. We live 100 miles from our nearest IKEA store at Exeter so collection is not an option.If you think this is a hard review, previously - from other companies we’ve had wardrobe doors, wood working machines, double glazing units etc. I won’t bore you with other items.

IKEA,Money taken. Delivery late. Order eventually cancelled.,"Like many reviewers before me.... IKEA don’t even deserve the one star minimum I had to give them here. My parents ordered sofas online with IKEA. They had arranged to get their old furniture removed on the day the IKEA delivery was due to make space. Delivery never arrived. Then they spent ages trying to get through to someone. No notification of delay or apology. Whoever they were talking to assured them that the furniture was in transit but was just delayed and would be with them the following week. They got an email then the day it before it was supposed to arrive saying their order was cancelled and they would have to wait up to 14 days for a refund.The astonishing thing is that their customer service agents told me when I called on my parents behalf that just because you are able to purchase an item in IKEA website and even though money is taken out of your account, it doesn’t mean the item is in stock. I was dumbfounded when they said this.The customer services team lead I was talking to said that her team have requested a note to be put on the IE website warning customers that stock levels don’t match website and they still take money money from your account.Save yourself the hassle and disappointment of dealing with IKEA. Do not purchase anything online. Particularly from Ireland. The customer service team lead herself admitted that it’s an absolute mess at the moment. Expected better from IKEA.",0,1

You could buy it from any store within a 400 mi radius. No notification. Nothing. I had to dispute the charges on my CC b/c I never got refunded for the cancellation. Now I get partial refund. Not even my full refund which BTW their website says FULL refund. Now I cant get ahold of anyone nor can you email for answers. I am missing money and I am pissed.

IKEA,Zero star,"Zero star! Worst customer service.I usually give positive comments if I have to leave some, but Ikea is doing extremely poor jobs in customer service. I ordered a white table on Nov. 25th, 2020, and the customer service notified me that the delivery would be delayed due to the pandemic. I totally understood it. They delivered a week after the estimated delivery date, which was still acceptable for me. However, they delivered only table legs... The tabletop was missing. I called them right away, and they told me that they would deliver it as soon as they can at no delivery charge. I waited for another 2 weeks, and the status was still preparing. I called them again, and they just kept saying it was just being delayed due to the pandemic. The agent I spoke with told me that it was still in stock and there would be no problems. All I had to do was to be patient. Then, I got an email that they would have to cancel the order because it was out of stock. They no longer get the freakin phone calls and no response to my email. What should I do with the table legs without a tabletop? They charged me $45 for delivering the legs, and now they are asking me to return them at the store. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced.",0,1
IKEA,Our experience with IKEA was really bad and we are dissatisfied.,"Our experience with IKEA was really bad. We ordered a lot of stuff for our new apartment in IKEA (sofa, bed, sofa bed, desk) etc. However, when we made the order in the store the employee told us that half of the sofa cannot be delivered in the new address as the moving date was one month ahead. She did not mention though that if we made the order online we could have the entire sofa delivered to the new address and there was no need to pay twice for the delivery or trasfer the sofa ourselves. Apart from this fact, just 2 days before the delivery, they called us and they told us that most parts of the desk were out of stock even though they have been ordered (they claimed that it was a mistake and even when we ordered them they were out of stock). When we told them that we wanted also to cancel then the rest part (the two right legs of the desk), they told us that this is not possible and that we have to receive them and then return them to the store. This is totally unacceptable! The entire communication with IKEA was really bad and I would not advise it to anyone from now on.",0,1
IKEA,Can't reach customer service at all,I've been trying to set up an online account to order an item from them. Their system continually tells me it thinks I'm a bot and to try again. After multiple tries I thought I would email or phone them. It took me over 10 minutes of online searching to find a way to contact them. They clearly don't want potential customers phoning or emailing them! I phoned them and held on the line for nearly 25 minutes before I gave up.

I checked the tracking and it said the order was canceled yesterday. I did not get any notification about the ordering being canceled. I called Ikea and they said it was out of stock and that's why it was canceled and it was out of stock in the other colors. I was told that I could have an alternate which was incorrect information. It took almost an hour for the supervisor to get on the phone after I asked for her. She said I couldn't get an alternate and they only thing they could do was refund me. The dresser is still available on the website even though it was out of stock. I now have to go out and buy a dresser.

IKEA,"Avoid, especially if you're spending more than a few £.","Sadly, Ikea has seemingly changed, for the worse. The customer service is pretty much non-existent, in that you cannot reach anyone. The phone lines are closed 'due to high demand', you cannot speak to anyone online, and they don't have an email address. So, don't buy anything you cannot afford to write off.I returned something worth £400 a month ago. No refund as yet, no contact from them, and I have literally no way of getting in touch. On the site they have a phone number but that doesn't work when you call it (and if you do get through it's an hour on hold), and their chat function is not always available, and when it is you get booted out of it 'by accident' so that you still cannot speak to anyone (again, minimum waiting time half an hour).

As per The Consumer Rights Act 2015 section 28 (3) 'the trader must deliver the goods (a) without undue delay, and (b) and in any event, not more than 30 days after the day on which the contract is entered into.'I have called your 'customer service' team on three occasions now and been on hold for over 30 minutes each time and each phone call has lasted over an hour so if your service is going to be this abysmal at least make this phone number a free one. Your customer service is shocking, considering the fortune you have made through lockdown to offer the level of service you do is inexcusable. I have put this through the Resolver process which you completely ignored and quite honestly I am now ready to take this to court for a refund of the order, compensation for my phone bills and court costs due to you breaching the law and me incurring these expenses.I think waiting 3 months is more than adequate in a pandemic, especially in light of the fact I have made numerous attempts and several avenues to get this matter sorted without going down the legal route.

We finally get it and bring it home to put it together and we’re missing the door hinges... we live an hour away and needed this armoir for clothes and now won’t have the hinges shipped for another week or so which means we’re going to have another week of our clothes being tossed wherever because we don’t have enough space.

IKEA,One star is too much for IKEA,"One star is too much for IKEA, but it won't let me give zero.I ordered a desk online as I need to work from home. Delivery option was an extra £40 for a delivery in 3 weeks time! So, I opted for the click and collect option - which still cost an extra £5. Why you should have to pay to collect from the store is beyond me. The nearest store is an hour away in London, but I needed it urgently so went for this option. I drove to the store only to be told there had been a mistake and the desk is out of stock. This would have been OK - mistakes happen, but I then explained I had driven to London to collect it and to save me going back empty handed could they find another store in London that I could collect from. The answer was basically no, we don't help customers, you have to phone ""Customer Services"". So I sat in the car park and phoned their customer service number. After 40 minutes of being on hold listening to Christmas music (on January 7th!) I gave up and hung up.I have been told I can have my money back in 4-5 days. Why 4-5 days? They took the money off me instantly, why can't they give it back instantly. So I now have the cost of a drive to London, a 40 minute phone call and half a day wasted and not even got my money back.I tried to phone again when I got home to complain, but the ""customer service"" number now says it is not operating at this time due to high demand. i.e. there must be a lot of unhappy customers out there.",0,1

HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO WORK?!I thought I would speak to Customer Services but I have been trying to get through for days. Either I get the message that the service isn't available or I am on hold for half an hour only to be disconnected justwhen you think you are being transferred.

Phone numbers looped into ""We cannot take calls at this time due to high call volume, send us an email"" with no option to leave message. No options to file claim online that matched the situation; no email contacts available online that I could find. Finally filed claim for other reason (""Cancel Order"") as I didn't know how else to get ahold of them. Got an email in response a couple days later from US_CSC_Aftersales @ ikea.com asking for info that I'd already provided. Sent them the info they requested plus picture of how the item arrived. Then nothing. Emailed again in a week. Nothing. Emailed again weekly after that asking about refund status. Still nothing.Ikea's customer service is terrible and I absolutely do not recommend. What a waste of money, on both the item and the ridiculously high shipping fees, all for a smashed item. Here's the full email from Ikea, from email address US_CSC_Aftersales @ ikea.com :Thank you for reaching out to us.We are sorry for any difficulties that you may have experienced with your order.Please let us know which plant pot arrived broken.If you need additional assistance please contact us back.

Both food areas upstairs and down were packed, staff overrun and customers adhering to1.5 metres the drink machine upstairs was not broken however IKEA still displayed their specials including the refills ... it wasn’t until you were up to the glass refi area they had a sign advising of drink machines not working therefore customers having to pay extra for bottled drinkings, the Swedish Meatball gravy tasted watered down and chips dry overall our experience was not as it was in the past",0,2
IKEA,"Received partial order, representative not helpful in any way.","Ordered 2 table tops and 8 legs 12/18/20. Received in good condition 2 table tops and 2 legs. Was only charged for what I received. Customer service explained the remaining legs were out of stock. They are to be discontinued in April of 2021. Customer service could not answer whether they would be produced or not before discontinuation. The representative suggested that I check the site and the store every day until then. No other offer of a different product, or suggestion of what to do with my table tops. I had a suggestion, I kept it to myself. I was assured this was a final answer and that there was nothing else that could be done. I was offered the chance to return the products to my local store for a refund, not to cover what I paid in shipping. I was disappointed. If I am able to get the remaining table legs, I will pay for them. I will never purchase any other product from IKEA.",0,1
IKEA,Ikea policies and procedures are based…,"Ikea policies and procedures are based on you visiting their store and making purchases you did not intend to make. So during a pandemic their inadequate on line order system risks your life. They won’t even allow you to buy a product in which you pay an outrageous shipping charge because it is labeled a first come first serve. They make it impossible for anything resembling a no contact pick up. They want money and do not care how many lives they risk. We have called, tried to order on line but always get a different story. This company should be ashamed and shut down during the pandemic!",0,1
IKEA,Worst customer service ever EVER,"March 2020- Ordered two bedside tables and paid 30 dollars shipping .May- one of them arrivedJune- other bedside was not delivered. I contact them. They ask me to contact fedex. FedEx has no record of item. I request a refund, the decide to sent me a replacement. Never arrives. Item is out of stock, I request a refund, refund never deposited. For months, they don’t answer their customer service line. (Due to “COVID”) Finally in December I am able to reach customer service again and request a replacement or refund. After half an hour with a representative, They issue a refund but declined to return my shipping cost... 9 Months!! And all I have is 1 bedside table that does not match, therefore I will have to buy two new bedside tables. I lost $30 dollars of shipping for an item that never arrived. This was the worst costumer service I’ve ever encountered. Do not buy IKEA!",0,1
IKEA,Expensive and poor delivery,Paid 85Eur delivery for a malm desk which costs 115Eur where it would have taken them 2-3hrs max to deliver to my place :D anyway... 6 days later on the day they're supposed to deliver they messaged me & emailed me they will deliver between 9am-1pm they did not deliver. Now the next morning I called in they said they have no idea why it wasn't delivered and tried to give me a delivery date which was next week but after paying that absurd delivery amount and reading some of the reviews i thought ill look somewhere else and just asked for a refund and they did refund me in full.

IKEA,Terrible online ordering from Ikea…,Terrible online ordering from Ikea Chicago. When the sofa I wanted finally became available (the system will not let you order if an item is not available) I ordered with an estimated delivery date of 12/19/20. I received an automated call from the delivery company not long after confirming the the date. 12/19/20 came and there was no further communication about the delivery so I called. After a long hold time I got a customer service rep who told me only the frame was available. Why did the Ikea system let me order and tell me 12/19/20 if the unit I ordered was not actually going to be available? Christmas was a bit awkward with no sofa for guests to sit on. Very disorganized company. Beware.,0,1

Had delivery for a couple of weeks ago and it never came then they said that the next day would be today so I sat around all day waiting for it even rang twice and they told me yeah it's on the way. Another man said the delivery driver said he will be there in an hour to drop it off. This is literally 5 hours ago. My slot was between 7.30am and 1.30 pm.

IKEA,Wouldn't even given them 1 star for…,"Wouldn't even given them 1 star for online orders. We tried to place an order for furniture in May 2020 but could not get a delivery slot. In Sept we got one but this was cancelled within a few hours and we could not reorder as no deliveries available. Money went back into bank 3 days later. Eventially at beginning of Nov we secured a delivery for £600. The money was immediately taken from our account, delivery was not until 20th December but we planned around it. Our slot was between 12pm and 6pm, one item was a sofa so we removed our old sofa that morning. No delivery arrived although tracker said it had been delivered. I messaged ikea and still have not had any reply. I could not call as they had shut down phone lines. The following day I called and was on hold for 90 mins, then spoke to someone who told me there had been a landslide in Carlisle and order would be with me on next 48 hours, no ref no needed as company would text me directly. No delivery arrived we were left with no sofa from 20th right over Christmas. We live in Scotland so not sure why landslide in Carlisle affected delivery. I have been in touch with AA and they are unaware of any landslide in area at all. Now 27th a week with no sofa, or communication from IKEA or any other part of my order. I rang again and eventually got through 1hr 10 mins after being on hold. The lady put me on hold while she spoke to required dept. She said for 1 min, 10 mins later I was hung up on. I awaited a call back as it could be an error, they have mobile and landline no. nobody called. I called again, on hold again, once connected I was again put on hold for yet another 15 mins to be told my order would be rescheduled for 10th January. By this time we will have been without sofa for 3 weeks. I asked for issue to be escalated as not satisfied with delivery date, unhumane to be sitting on the floor. A manager was to call me back. That didn't happen!!! I have emailed complaints email address from 21st Dec and not even had recognition of email never mind a response. Certainly will not recommend ikea online orders/ deliveries and customer service is non existent.Certainly NOT …The Wonderful Everyday",0,1
IKEA,I had the worst experience I have ever had…,"I had the worst experience I have ever had with a company last time I ordered from Ikea. I ordered a desk that I payed to be delivered, however, they only delivered half of it! Ikea then insisted that they couldn't get the other half to me for over a month. Additionally, if I wanted a refund or to return the product I would have to transport the desk to an ikea store myself! How, as a student in London who doesn't drive am I meant to do that! I ended up spending over £30 on an Uber to Ikea to return the half of the desk so I could afford to buy another! The most I was offered as compensation was £20. The customer help line also takes at least 30mins and in some cases over an hour to get through to someone!I would not recommended that anyone order anything from Ikea as it is not reliable in the slightest and you could end up paying a very high price like I did!!",0,1

IKEA,I am totally disgusted with IKEA,I am totally disgusted with IKEA. I wish I had read the reviews prior to placing my order. I placed it in the beginning of November to insure the items were delivered to me well before the Christmas rush. I was given a date of 4th Dec. for delivery which was perfect. The order arrived but with 13 items missing. I called immediately and a very helpful lady assisted me and after listing out the missing items I was told these would be dispatched from the Dublin shop on the Monday as she checked to insure they were in stock there. I waited a week but when nothing arrived I called again. Seems the order had never processed so I had to go through same thing all over again with another helpful lady and was told it would now arrive today 17 Dec. I took the day off work and waited but no delivery so I called to check and was told by another nice lady that unfortunately the order had NOT been processed. I saw red at that point. The options were that they could process it AGAIN but could not guarantee a delivery by Christmas. Some items were toys as gifts so this was not acceptable. At that point I had enough of IKEA and all this messing about so I asked for a refund for all the missing items only to be told this would take 10 to 14 days. I work in mail order and refunds only take 24 to 48 hours to show up in a customers account. They were very quick to charge my card for the full amount when the order was placed. At no point did I receive a notice that any of my order was out of stock and to see if I wanted a refund or to wait till they were available. There was no correspondence from the company once they had your money - it is the customer who has to keep trying to track down their order and sort out Ikea’s mistakes. This is not an acceptable way of doing business and I will never use them again and will warn others to be wary when placing an order.,0,1

When this didn't occur I called Ikea's customer support. The customer representative explained that the order didn't process correctly as it had been stuck in the system. She explained that she would re-order the item for delivery later in the week and assured me the gift would be with me in time for Christmas as the local store had almost 30 in stock.Two days later I was told the item had been cancelled and refunded as there was no stock available.It has now been 14 days since the product was cancelled and refunded and there's no sign of any refund in my account.

I contacted the customer service and was told my order will not be arriving until 4/12 which meant I placed my order in October and would have waited 2 months for it to arrive. The 4th comes and again no delivery I gave them the benefit of the doubt by allowing an extra day before I contact the customer service and again no delivery the 6th comes and I received two parts of my order (A shelf for the wardrobe I ordered) but no wardrobe which was the main part of my order. I contacted the customer service and was told the product I ordered was out of stock and this was the first I heard of this within the two months of which the order was placed, it also did not say out of stock on the website. The customer service employee had promised me I would get my order that coming Tuesday and to no surprise I did not get my product. I again called the customer service and was met with a rude and very helpless customer service team member who seemed they couldn’t care less about my situation and gave me no information about my order and wouldn’t refund me the product as I had “gotten some of the order”. This is not the first time I’ve shopped with IKEA but I can assure it will be the last as this has been the worst customer experience I’ve ever had with a company.

IKEA,Worse than MFI in the 1980s,"We purchased a large EKET combination, costing just under £800. The plastic locking pins on one of the double cupboards side panels were all broken off when we opened the box. Another had a broken back panel. The door fittings are appalling and it is virtually impossible to get the doors fitted evenly around all 4 sides. It’s only due to the fact that I am an able DIY enthusiast that I could repair the damage and managed after 3 days work to complete the project. Ikea customer service were impossible to engage with and no where to be seen. In short, equivalent to the worst phase of MFI in the 1980s.",0,1

Woke up this morning to 3 emails telling me that my ""order has successfully been cancelled"" and a refund will be issued shortly. Called customer service and had to wait over an hour to speak with a rep. She was honest and told me that they oversold many products and have been cancelling many orders. On top of that she said that there is no way to know when anything will come back in stock. When I initially made the order I had to change it many times due to things that were listed as unavailable once I went to checkout, but didn't show as such on the product page. I was working off the information that if I was able to order it, it would actually be available. Disappointing to know this is not the case, and severely weakens my trust in ordering off the website, knowing there's a good chance it will get cancelled. I have been waiting for many of the items to complete a renovation, but will now be shopping elsewhere as I am on a deadline. This is obviously bad business and is not a way to retain customers...",0,1

IKEA,Very poor customer service,"We had a large return order of unopened items with all of our receipts. We also went on a 'slow day' where there was hardly a line. We followed all the rules and the purchases were made less than a month from the return date. First of all, upon seeing the number of returns we had, every rep that glanced up suddenly had to pee to take a break. We finally ended up with a return customer service rep named Amanda who patiently helped us by going above and beyond to navigate a system that needs obscure information like a what register were you on and what day you bought this stuff. The Ikea computer system is really senseless and very hard to use I'm still not sure why she had to ""find"" all the receipts when we had them anyways but that is beyond the point. The thing that really struck me was how poor her coworkers treated Amanda and the situation. Not a one coworker came to help and IN FACT a neighboring coworker kept telling her to stop helping us out because now the line was backing up. She did this several times. Did I not matter as a customer? If things were taking too long for her, why did she not come over to help? OR why didn't any of the people literally standing around behind the swinging doors come help? Was the $15,000 I did spend at IKEA not important for the rep to help us through some returns that were responsibly handled and organized by us. Amanda thankfully ignored the selfish coworker and persevered. Amanda is a rare diamond of customer service skills in a generally large pool of apathetic, 'just here for the pay check and my manager is not watching' pool of employees found at IKEA. I have had several poor customer service experiences at IKEA that have made me really resent going there.",0,1

IKEA,That's a -1 star,"That's a -1 star, by the way. Same experience as many here in that today my ""alleged"" delivery disappeared and I received texts identical to those mentioned below ""we cannot fulfil..."". This leads me to believe that IKEA took my money, along with a delivery charge of £40, in November, knowing it was unable to deliver the goods. And then on the delivery day, faked a paper trail. That's a pretty serious offence. Here's hoping I'm wrong.",0,1

I’m on hold now for 2 3/4 hours and twice transferred - disconnected - what is going on at this company? I am absolutely so disappointed at the customer service - no one can answer why and just tell me to wait 4 - 6 weeks! Come on IKEABBB is my next step!,0,1
IKEA,IKEA Ireland - better shop online than going there,"I find IKEA has become a more pleasant online shopping experience than visiting the shop. It is worth to pay the 50-60 Euro shipping costs (for heavy stuff) than going there yourself. Customer support on the phone is decent and responsive (waited maybe 5 minutes maximum in the last 5 interactions I had to make). IKEA stands behind their warranty and replaced our Friheten sofa for free after 5 years with a brand new one. So although the product doesn't last as long as you'd expect, the warranty does.Due to COVID-19, It is unbelievably crazy how long are the lines. Don't go there, don't waste your life, better to order online and pay delivery. If you do decide to go, make sure to wait for COVID-19 to end. Then if you don't have a car use GoCar or Yuko.Generally, I don't like spending hours there. The Wifi is rubbish, can't really login. Cafeteria is dirty, and though there are vegan options they seem to be not great at all. Go there quickly focused on what you need for your home.",0,4
IKEA,BE WARNED!,"BE WARNED!This is the start of what may be a protracted complaint process with IKEA. A delivery by IKEA was twice not made. No contact or apology was made. The customer made changes to accommodate each delivery time. Trying to contact IKEA to resolve the matter was near impossible, with no telephone or email contact in place. Only through diligent searching on the internet were two telephone numbers found for IKEA. We have now found out that they are premium rate numbers and we were charged as soon as the number was dialled, not answered. One call took nearly 70 minutes to be answered. The call charges to us for pursuing a problem entirely of IKEA's making has been £97.38, including five calls, each of less than 30 seconds and costing £6.45 EACH. No information was provided to clarify that the numbers were premium rate and what charges were made. The conclusion that we have made is that there is no customer service, only an IKEA service.",0,1

IKEA,How not to have a returns service,"We recently purchased a wall mounted extractor hood for our cooker from IKEA. Unfortunately there was no indication in the product details that the ""chimney"" part was not compatible with ceilings that have a coving. We therefore need to return the the extractor hood. However, while the website says the IKEA returns policy is upto 365 days except for certain items, it is necessary to find a person in order to arrange this. IKEA provides two numbers for customer service and after sales. Neither number usually works and simply provides a message that this number is not available and when it is the wait is interminable with possibly the worst on-hold music I have ever heard. Most of the time you are directed to the IKEA Chatbot LATTJO. This does not help much and tends to take the harassed customer around in circles and usually back to the returns policy page. It might be preferable to return the goods to the nearest collect and service centre, but that is shut. IKEA may have some very nice products, but make sure you make a perfect choice and ensure you have checked all the dimensions provided. Make any sort of mistake and you are likely to have serious difficulty in sending to goods back for refund. As often happens this review is written while listening to execrable on-hold music on the phone which is really an insult to the intelligence. It was 62 minutes into the call when a service person picked up the phone. He was very helpful but suffering from computer malfunctions which meant that he could not complete the return but would have to send me an email with the return details.Very poor service even if the better stuff is value for money. probably not worth buying unless you live close to a store. The pandemic is given as excuse but this is no excuse really especially for on-line customers. With at least another 6 months of risk for shoppers regardless of vaccines being available, one would of thought IKEA might have taken on more people to answer the phone. If Amazon can manage it so could IKEA. I cannot help wondering how many customers will have given up waiting. This was on the evening of 07th December 2020.",0,1

Ask for the customer service email address and then given the wrong address (maybe on purpose, I don't know). Customer service at IKEA is a complete joke. I'm sure IKEA management are wondering why they are losing to the likes of Amazon. Two words customer service it's a big hint!",0,1

When I did get to speak to an adviser I asked if she could phone me back if we get cut off, if I could speak to a supervisor, if I could get an email address as calls were taking too long, I was given a flat no to all of my requests.

IKEA,2* level overall.,"The level of customer service you receive when ordering with Ikea is very poor, they don’t have much stock and will refuse to place an order if one component is out of stock however if an order is placed an item happens to be out of stock in can go on back order…. Go figure? In the past I made 6 unsuccessful trips to the Perth store to place an order (their website doesn’t recognise my address… turns out to be a fairly regular issue.) after calling and checking ALL items were in stock before driving the 50KM to the store. Customer service phone lines are clearly understaffed or overwhelmed as I have never got through to someone without 30-40 min wait (at best, one time spent 4 hours in the queue.) A refund took them 6 weeks to provide and almost 20 calls. We tried to place one last order with them (I am a mug for doing this) and took a day off work for the delivery….. no delivery and no answer on the phone (they also provide the wrong number in their automated SMS.) For a larger multinational business they provide a very poor level of service and I would think twice before using them for anything more than meatballs now. A 2* review has been given because when they do have stock it can be an ease process to buy a small item and its quality is average.",0,2

I don't have a car, but I'll manage somehow. I get to the store at 20:40 (store closes at 21). I find the carpet eventually, but it says to contact an employee and present them with a product number.

Desk was better quality than expected and perfectly adequate for my needs.",0,4
IKEA,Poor service,"Got a text yesterday saying that my item would be delivered today (Monday) between 9am and 1pm. It's now 4pm and nothing has arrived. Tried to call customer services and some automated message saying 'we're busy right now, come back some time later'.... yes, very helpful. Go onto webchat. and see that I'm number 30 or so in the queue.... then the page refreshed and then disappeared. Go back to main website... Webchat disabled. Very very poor customer service from a company that you'd expect better service from. So, now I have no idea when my item is being delivered.... apart from the 'tracking' bit which says my order is 'being prepared'.... Not a very happy customer right now.",0,1

I have been on hold for over 2 hours trying to sort this, was given a date 1.5 weeks away. IKEA wont do anything to move the date forward, just made a note of my complaint. I am now living in a flat with no sofa, and no wardrobe to unpack.I asked to speak to a manager, they wont put you through.Whilst they make note of a complaint, they do not do anything to try to actually resolve the issues they create.

IKEA,"Fabulous wardrobe, good service",I ordered a Hauga sliding door wardrobe from IKEA. Selected today (21.11) as my delivery day. Scheduled arrival was between 12pm and 5pm. IKEA sent tracking info and it was delivered at 1pm. Delivery people were great - helped me to get the huge packages in my house safely whilst maintaining social distancing. Delivery cost £40 but total cost of wardrobe was still less than £250 which is a bargain. Love the wardrobe - very easy to out together - done on my own which is not recommended but was really easy.,0,5

They told me that it was an oversell and to contact customer service. I called customer service and they were closed during working hours! I queued for an hour to collect the items, received appalling customer service and rudeness in the store and will have to battle to get a refund for the item I never received! How are they getting away with it in such a competitive world? Please don’t buy from them, they don’t deserve your custom.",0,1
IKEA,Terrible customer service!!!!,"I ordered a Malm desk to be delivered by IKEA but instead have received a Malm bed. I couldn’t even tell the delivery guy that it was the wrong item and ask him to take it back because by the time I got to the front door, the delivery guy was already back in his van and shouted to me ‘That’s for you’ as he pointed to the boxes he’d left and then drove off. Tried contacting IKEA to sort this as their website says to contact them as soon as possible to sort any issues out but cannot get through to them via webchat or phone. Also contacted via Twitter and still no response. I understand IKEA will be busy at the minute but what gets me is that they’re still happy for customers to order their products and happy to take your money, but when it comes to sorting any issues out and rectifying their mistakes they don’t want to know. If they can’t sort customers problems out then I suggest they close completely until they sort this mess out as I’m not the only one experiencing problems with their customer service at the moment. Sort it out IKEA!!",0,1

Tried to email the customer support email but the email link pasted an incorrect address into my mail and I received a reply email telling me my email was blocked by recipient...then discovered the wrong address when I compared it to the address written on their page.

Service issue & be more available. Not everyone lives near a store. Part numbers aren't all listed on the instructions either so this is another issue which could have made my problem. Easy. I see ikea doesn't even comment on this site... They need to really listen to their customers, esp. As there is so much competition now with online shopping, similar products, often cheaper with much cheaper or free delivery..... This is only good business sense!!! I bought a Hemnes 8 drawer unit from IKEA online, delivered in good time but one split in a panel. I messaged them as there's no other way to get HolD of ikea but got an automated reply. The unit is useless without a replacement panel. It's has a rob ot on customer service which says they can replace a part if you give a part no. But there is no number on. Either the part or the instructions. £215 and I have a pile of wood put together apart from the faulty part so I can't use it & have my clothes in plastic bags. Jaques Alston",0,1

One was fine and had all the appropriate hardware. the second item a Lilligan high cabinet was 1) missing some brackets and some wooden dowels. My son had some extra dowels from some furniture he had bought so we put the thing about 3/4's together when I realized the legs were missing. I called and called and called - 6x waited on customer service hold for 30+ minutes before finally hanging up. Emailed and no help. Finally, we got in the car and drove 35 minutes one way to the store. they said the feet were not included even though the picture when ordering same shows them. So I bought - for another $21 - the feet. Drove 35 minutes back home and found (1) 1 leg was missing the hole to attach the footer (2) the feet were not correct for my cabinet. I called Visa and contested it as I am NOT doing an hour and 10 minute drive again. I will NEVER buy or recommend IKEA again. Horrid customer service - in fact saying they have customer service is laughable. the 3rd product was a cutlery insert - size was over what it said and I returned it since I was in the store for the ""feet.""",0,1

When they arrived I’ve opened all the noses to start putting them together and I’ve noticed bits in every box are missing. 2 hours on the phone and finally got a delivery date for them and yet again it another 2 weeks off before they can be delivered. Adviser was very rude. Wouldn’t put Me on to a manager or supervisor, wouldn’t give me an address or anything to write to.

I can, however, see it and touch it. It is coming from the pipe to the dishwasher installed by Ikea. This I have told them, twice, one week ago, only to be met by silence, So much for urgency!I paid hugely more to have Ikea install the kitchen, rather than a third party.

Nobody delivered in the correct day, so I called them and a guy told me that because of the lockdown there was a delay, so I wait 3 days more and nothing, I called them again and a second guy explained to me that they didn't have the tabletop, so I asked a refund. 3 days after I called again to check if it was everything okay with the refund, this call was in the morning, a lady, Emma, told me that was everything, okay, but, after 2 hours a guy delivered the underframe at my house, WHAT WOULD I DO WITH ONLY THE UNDERFRAME WITHOUT THE TABLETOP? So I called them AGAIN, explained everything and a lady asked to hold on that she was going to check something and guess what HUNG UP the phone... I called AGAIN and explained everything AGAIN, and the guy said that someone is going to my house to collect the underframe and only after this collection they will do the refund (which I have to wait 7 to 14 days), which is not fair, I already did the request 4 days BEFORE, now they want to wait 1 week more to get my money back! UNBELIEVABLE! and thennnnn when I was telling that is not fair this guy HUNG UP THE PHONE on my face!!!Emma and Daniel from the customer service hung up the phone on my face!",0,1
IKEA,Absolutely the worst experience ever,Absolutely the worst experience ever! paid £660 pounds on a wardrobe was damaged wasn’t fully delivered I’m out of pocket as failed to deliver replacements and have had to pay again to have wardrobe doors fitted . Can’t get through to customer service when you do they are diabolical. have promised a couple of things when we finally took to Twitter But communication is still dire DO NOT BUY any big items from this store the task rabbit service told me all of they’re deliveries are wrong!!

IKEA,Ordered a new kitchen   Two cabinets…,Ordered a new kitchen Two cabinets placed on shopping list. Staff advises two cabinets in next week. Now 3 weeks and no base corner cabinet. Kitchen left with no sink or counter. Cabinet in edmonton store and halifax store. Rather than do the right thing and offering to get the missing necessary part to etobicoke ikea refuses to help and tells me to wait until whenever the cabinet arrives. First i was misled about timing of delivery of missing stock. Then i received absolutely no help considering that the kitchen is left half finished. Product great. Price great. After sales help useless. Chat line a waste of time. Phoning is a joke. So now i will be going to store and they will be getting the base cabinet delivered from halifax or i will be causing them a big problem. No one is going to mislead me. Then give me a line of bull while i wait wjth no kitchen if you order a kitchen do not accept anything unless all the cabinets are supplied. You can wait for doors but anyone knows you need the boxes.,0,1

IKEA,Website shopping experience is the WORST I've ever seen.,"The eCommerce experience is shockingly BAD, it's beyond embarrassing, a user experience disaster. I would give ZERO stars if that was possible. Which in this day and age, is completely unacceptable for a global multi-billion dollar PRIVATE company.They (clearly) don't care about customer or user experience, about limiting your frustration or wasting your time. You can't add multiple of one item to your cart, you have to do that in the cart, after. You can't order any item for click and collect at your local store, if there are no spaces available that day - GOD forbid you want to look at availability of upcoming days–like you are able to with any other business that moved quickly to add curb-side pick up options during a time of COVID...even companies that are a fraction of the size and resources of IKEA can get it right - guess what? YOU CAN'T! You have to go back to the site EVERY DAY, like a lottery and wish and hope you are able to find available spot - only THEN can you complete your order - but it's all secret, like they don't want to tell you that they can only work one day at a time, with no view into a calendar of upcoming days. Then if you are lucky enough to be able to complete your order, if any of the items in your cart are not available for click and collect OR delivery, they DELETE them from your cart - nope, they don't save it for future, give you the option to move it to a shopping list, so you can add them back in - they are just gone. Availability - Yes it's in stock: but no, you can't purchase it. Inventory shows in stock (over 35 items), but when you try and check out, it says they are not available, when clearly, even after checking their phone line, with the item number, they are in fact very much in stock.If their click and collect spaces are limited, why not have a message on the site, for customers to manage their expectations? Why not show more than 1 or 2 days availability for spaces available? Why not provide a message to your customers that are clearly having a terrible experience with your site? Why are you not looking to do things that will bring your customers back to you when this is all over. I realize this is a *RANT*. I have been a customer for 3 decades and this experience makes me want to never shop there again.",0,1

Same excruciating wait time.Was told by a rep ""well maybe you should have driven there to buy it"". Hours from my location. Smart mouth and hung up on me. Called back trying to reach someone. Finally when did they didnt care about case#. They canceled order and issued a new one with new delivery date. Never rcvd as of yet. No updates. Can't see order online. Same crap all over again. Will never order from IKEA again. Billed for product before it ships. Called credit card company to dispute. Will pay when rcvd. Have spent hours on phone. No other way to contact if you can ever get through. System even hangs up on you. Never again. Beware!!! Now Nov. 28th.. . Still no product and no updates. Can't contact. Call is terminated.

My compliant to Ikea goes back to April 2020 and we are still no further forward. Ikea sent out a man to inspect the sofa's and chair, he did not turn up as advised.

IKEA,Where to begin?,"Where to begin?! I used to spend thousands of dollars on IKEA products to furnish my entire home. Items were solid, quality, fairly inexpensive, and the end product looked good. Customer service USED to be reliable.Fast forward to 3 years of not shopping at IKEA and so much has changed - for the WORST. Like most people during the pandemic, I needed a desk and chair to work from home. Nothing expensive, just something to get me through the next few months. I bought a LINNMON desk (under 30 dollars), and a LOBERGET/BLYSKÄR swivel chair (under 30). I actually visited the store to see the products and they were just not great but okay for the price, but good enough for the purpose of short-term telecommuting. Or so I thought.I couldn't purchase the products in store, as they're basically out of everything during the pandemic, so I kept an eye on their stock, ordered the products online for in-person pick up (the website is a laggy and unintuitive MESS). One item in my order was confirmed, the second (table) never was, even on the scheduled pick up day.I drove an hour, again, to the store, had to chase staff down to find out why one order was still ""processing,"" got that sorted, then had drive to the garage to do a ""click and collect"" (which went easily enough). Got my items home, seemed simple enough to put together, at first sight.However, when I went to put the table together, which comes in several parts (including the metal base the legs screw into), I had to struggle to try to get the screws in, because the cheap table top holes are so shallow and barely there, compared to the size of the screws (and no tools were provided), that I developed 3 blisters on the palm of my hand and *still* wasn't able to get the screws into the table! It's the cheapest, worst product in the history of my lifetime, and I've bought a lot of furniture in my adult life!No luck trying to contact customer service. They haven't been answering their phones since July 2020! So, guess what? I'm returning both pieces, another hour's drive and an hour wait time to queue for the ""Return"" department, and I'm never shopping at IKEA again.I used to love IKEA but, like everyone else who sold out to C h i n a - where the flimsy and cheap table and chair are made, quality is definitely not what one would call this junk. Plus, their site doesn't even allow reviews - at least, not that I've found a way to do so, and I've looked! - so *buyer beware* and make sure to read the lowest ratings on their site, as those are the actual real reviews!AVOID at ALL costs!",0,1

When I asked them to take them to the right room they said that due to COVID it wasn't possible as all the windows need to be opened before they arrive. IKEA did not mention this in any communications!But can you get hold of IKEA to discuss? - after a 46-minute wait on the phone (IKEA provides no email contact) I got hold of someone who said the compliant had to go to someone else. So if IKEA really can't deliver to a room or my choice due to COVID they should not charge the £50 delivery charge for the service! Fake advertising, taking my money under a false pretense!",0,1

Therefore you cannot buy the couch, and some of them wanted me to buy the half parts and wait for the second missing parts, come back and purchase the rest of the missing parts and pay another delivery. Until, one guy, yes one guy from customer service name Alex, put an afford to schedule the parts available at Rhodes to be delivered, and open a case for the rest of missing parts and are available at Tempe.

Alex, is an excellent asset to IKEA. he was very passionate despite my frustration from previous members from couch dep section and customer service. Alex treated me very nice and kind.

IKEA,The worst experience,"This Ikea order and delivery has been one of the worst experiences of my life. Firstly, the order came damaged and we had to send it back and re-ordered it all again (63 packages - €4000). Secondly, some of the items that we first ordered, were not in stock anymore, and we had to chase them when they were back in stock, go and buy it ourselves as Ikea couldn't deliver them later (as it would have been normal because it was their mistake in the first place. We ordered the items when there were in stock). Then we had to chase for the refunds for weeks and call and stay on hold on the phone for hours.Thirdly, we designed a wordrobe in the Ikea Dublin store, and the guys there forgot to put all the items from the store design in the actual order and bill. We realised when we wanted to build the wordrobe that some shelfs were missing, and that we never paid for them as they were not put in the bill (just the design). Lastly, when the final order came, there were 63 packages - 459kg in total. I had to carry them all myself and another friend (some packages had 50kg and I have 50kg). I understand the covid rules, but it's insane that they didn't even bring them in front of the apart. door. What was I supposed to do? Make 5 orders and pay the delivery fee every time just so we could cary the 50kg items 4 floors?On top of all of these, the delivery guys delivered us 2 - 50kg packages that were not ours. We had to carry them all the way up, and then chase for the collect team to come one week after. The most horrible experience overall, and Ikea was not helpful at all even if we had a very large order. The contact support centre was ok, the people were nice, but for nothing if the delivery guys and people in the deposit messed up and damaged our delivery and then the wordrobe designer didn't export all the items in the actual order and bill....",0,1

Arrived and driver said he had been dreading coming to me as the night loaders had ""smashed it up"", advised me to refuse delivery. I did, now have no sofa and not a call or email from Ikea for past 24 hours. currently on hold with customer servives for past hour.Finally got through, he looked at the notes and said yes the delivery driver has said it was laoded damaged and should not have gone out. i asked what they were doing about it and said nothing they were waiting for me to contact them. arranged for a new delivery a week later, lets see what arrives. I asked about compensation as this was not an accident but a broken item was loaded wasting my time the delivery driver and now our time he said nothing but he would send me a £20 voucher in the next 7 days. I said i didnt feel this was addequate , he said thats the policy and there is nothing else he could do. I asked to speak to someone else he refused to put me through to anyone as this was also the polcy. One star may be one too many for this on customer service.Update.A week later. Covers arrived today via courier but sofas didn’t, contacted Ikea and they said they had changed the sofa delivery to two days later and if I had logged in I could have found this out myself. Silly me !!!.Oh and the £20 voucher hasn’t arrived.Update: Lorry arrived, delivery driver said you may want to check this before I unload it as it looks damaged. Went on the lorry and they had brought the same Broken one back ... couldn’t believe it. Need something to sit on so talked to customer service who said I could have it and they will send another when it comes back on stock. This time a promised £30 voucher. Been weeks and still haven’t got the first one. Wonder how many more calls it’s going to take..........well after the promised call waited a month and nothing so back to the phone.. on hold an hour and ten before answering, gave my reference number was told I’d be put on hold whole she looked it up... 20 minutes on hold and cut off. Called back under an hour this time and the chap said would I accept £60 and keep the broken one, said ok but still waiting for the other promised money, he said he would call me back. I doubt if I’ll ever get any money or a call. I have learned my lesson, do not buy from these people again. They really don’t care.",0,1

IKEA,Shockingly poor customer service at Ikea at the moment,"My friend Anna and I made an online Ikea order in September and was initially given a delivery date before the end of that month. At the last minute the date was put back to 1st October which was acceptable. We had of course paid for our items in full as normal (just under £110) and we had received a confirmation email of the payment and order, followed by a message confirming our order was complete and all was running to plan. Then nothing?! When we attempted to track our order the file simply says 'our order is being prepared' even though we had already been told everything had been compiled?! We can't seem to cancel the order or request a refund, we can't seem to reach anyone on the phone despite several attempts and the online chat link through the 'customer service' section of the website we found was extremely basic and very unhelpful. We are feeling very angry that on October 15th we are still waiting for our delivery and can get no further information about the delays or any idea about when we can expect to receive our purchases. We have been extremely patient and this experience has now deeply scarred our trust in Ikea. As online shopping is likely to be the main way in which purchases are made during the pandemic this will directly affect any decision we make about future shopping with Ikea. We are seeking a swift resolution to this shoddy and inconsiderate service if Ikea cares about customer experience at all.Update October 22nd - still no word at all from Ikea. Clearly they dont think customers matter at all - just in love with money, money, money! Taking my stars down to zero really but one is the lowest o the Trustpilot scale - not happy at all!",0,1

IKEA,DON'T BUY IKEA KITCHEN,"DON'T BUY IKEA KITCHENI ordered a kitchen - paid $5000 - Ikea recommended installation services were not even answering the phone or calling back to schedule an installation. I ended up finding another provider. I agreed on delivery date with Ikea. Ikea confimed by email the delivery date. NO ONE CAME ON THE DELIVERY DATE. We called Ikea customer service (1hour). They didn't know why the kitchen wasn't delivered but informed us that in any case, most items are out of stock in Montreal. We reminded them that the kitchen installer was coming in 7 days and we were facing $$ penalties if he wasn't able to do his job. They committed to find some stocks at boucherville. They told us that our issue would be raised as a top priority and someone from Boucherville will call us back the following day to schedule a delivery before end of week. NO ONE CALL US BACK THE FOLLOWING DAYWe called Ikea customer service back. One hour wait. They said they were not able to reschedule a delivery as the systems was saying the delivery already occured! They said that our file was ""being processed"" and there is nothing they can do to ensure a delivery before the installation date and most items are out of stock in Montreal. That's the kind of service you would get from Ikea. 1. You won't get your kitchen delivered,2. Tou won't recover your deposit from your Kitchen installer3. Your self employed kitchen installer who already had a hard financial time during COVID won't be able to complete his job and get paid (1 week worth of work). DON'T BUY IKEA KITCHEN.

IKEA,The delivery guy straight up lied about…,"The delivery guy straight up lied about ""trying"" to contact us besides phoning us according to the explanation of the customer service. I admit, it is my fault that I had bad phone signal while they tried to call me. But the guy also called me before the ""vereinbarte Lieferzeitraum"".Then I called the IKEA delivery guy, and he said things like: nicht mein Job, ich bin Beschaeftigt, rufen Sie die Kundenservice an. Lieferung jetzt? Nein! In ein Monat. Ich habe keine Zeit zum Liefern. Wir waren da. Auf wiedersehen! Lieferung nicht möglich. Wir sind beschäftigt. Ich gebe Ihnen meine Kollege (then he put the phone aside, not even listening).His German was just as broken as indicated by the 7-13 delivery feedback, then he hang up on me. I gave him a second chance to explain himself why he didn't ring the Intercom and why he didn't just go to the Reception of the building. There was a person sitting right at the entrance, whose job includes welcoming delivery staff, so at least he could have tried. DHL found us. Even DPD found us. Anyone on a 7-10EUR budget found us. IKEA on a 100EUR spedition budget couldn't find us. The Intercom instructions were in the address. We were all the time at home and no-one rang. I asked the receptioninst if anyone came during the indicated time, and no-one had been there.Yet, once I called the customer service, he saw a record that they had tried to reach me, they tried to ring, they even came in the building and didn't find my ""Briefkasten"" (hint: it's there, and before finding my Briefkasten, the Receptionist would have surely asked them if she could help). Therefore, I asked myself, why didn't the receptionist see anything and despite obvious Intercom numbers, why didn't we hear anything in the apartment? Either the spedition lied, or we are both deaf (hint: I can hear quite well) and the receptionist is blind (hint: she saw me quite well once I spoke to her). I also tested both the intercom and the doorbell. They worked. So then, the only conclusion I can find is that some lazy people want to avoid work by blaming failed delivery on some excuse. However, based on the above proof, the blame failed. In exchange for paying 100EUR delivery costs, I expect a higher quality of service. Obviously, I asked for a full refund including the spedition costs. To make sure it happens on time, I informed my credit card company requesting a chargeback having explained the situation. Furthermore, while speaking to customer service, I reported the delivery staff for the horrible service.In the unlikely case the 100% refund is disputed, I will continue voicing my opinion elsewhere, there are great forums.",0,1

They keep picking with us with quality, so that we cannot grow. The calls come in every 4 seconds, we have no voice or support and quality should ALWAYS be out-sourced, with people that have never worked onsite. Not a big ugly gorilla, that worked right in the building with all of us. So they work hand and hand with managers that want to pick with us, by giving bad scores. Please do an Audit as soon as possible and you can see what we mean.I know managers that are no longer with the company and have shared that they get people to call in to do prank calls, just to mess with certain people, so that they get bad scores. We think you should send a decoy to see what's going on. Also, we want Quality to be people who have Never seen us and don't know Any of the Management. Please understand, we are tired of having are jobs tested and toyed with. If you send someone in to look at the stats, you will see the people they keep messing with. It is so sad to work for a company that allows Management and quality to play with the co-workers livelihood. We also have not received ANY hazard pay for using our electricity and internet at home.

IKEA,"WORST customer service, FALSE information given to customer in person","We placed two in-store kitchen appliances (gas stove and refrigerator) for my elderly parents. Please note we would NOT have purchased it from Ikea if there's no delivery to the room of our choice due to these being heavy kitchen appliances, we would have gone elsewhere. In-store home delivery department associate Julia D as listed specifically told me ""these will be delivered to whichever room you would like."" I have also found the below screenshot from the Ikea website and highlighted in yellow on which items can be delivered to your room of choice due to COVID time.Delivery guys were extremely rude from the way they spoke and their actions. And neither one wore any face mask on or any PPE when approaching. My parents even provided PPE from face masks to shoe covers for them, they kept saying it's COVID (but not wearing PPE, that's very ironic).The delivery guys also dropped the refrigerator on purpose out of spite after my parents told them they will be calling to complain. Not being able to get these inside, we have no way of testing if these are in good condition and workable.The incident today really caused a massive amount of frustrations for my parents due to what they had to deal with today and now leaving two items currently sitting in the garage. Also, we felt that we have been lied to by the associate given out false information. This has by far the WORST customer service we have experienced, what if my parents didn't have a garage and it's currently raining season in Florida, are these heavy items supposed to be sitting out. These items are still sitting at the garage because no one can lift or move them, it's not really a garage decor.We need a solution on this issue ASAP as this is absolutely ridiculous: from being misinformed in store, getting unnecessary rudeness from the delivery people to unreachable customer service. Please think of the type of frustration my parents and I are going through after spending so much $$$ at IKEA, a place where we thought had the best products and service.",0,1

IKEA,Online & Customer service is the worst.,"IKEA’s online and phone customer service is the worst of any company I have ever had dealings with. If I could give only 1/2 star, I would! The first order I placed took over a month to deliver. Checking out was near impossible since I needed to ship to an order different than my billing address, their system would not allow it. I had to first buy a gift card, which took over a week to be emailed to me, and then use it instead of my credit card. Later, I tried placing a second order. (Big mistake!) When it needed to be cancelled, it took 2 phone calls, both of which I was on hold for over 45 minutes before anyone answered. Then, it took one month and 2 more hour long phone calls to get the refund for the canceled order. After the first phone call, I immediately received an email confirming the cancellation. But, weeks later I realized the customer service agent never processed the refund. When I tried to reorder, IKEA would not let me check out until I removed several items they decided were “limited quantity”. It is unfortunate that their online/website and customer service is so poor, because they have awesome products at fantastic prices - in their stores.",0,1

For two and a half months, they wouldn't refund my money for four chairs that I returned through the delivery guy. Took me hours of phone, speaking to representatives who tell you to wait for two weeks to get the refund, then you call after the two weeks had passed and they repeat the exact same thing and it goes on and on. Not to mention emails that go unanswered... Finally I called the American Express and told them what happened and emailed them the photo of the return order that the delivery guy signed as a proof of a return and the American Express refunded the money right away. I placed an order of a plastic table and two plastic chairs for kids on Sept. 11 and it gave me an estimate delivery date Sept. 27 Today is Sept 29 and no delivery update.

I was told the item would be replaced and was asked what day I'd like it delivered and was provided with a file number. I ended up receiving a refund notification the next day, with no explanation. I spent another hour waiting again on line again to speak to customer service and once again am transferred to someone else after explaining my situation. I am told the file number I was provided with for this case was incorrect and they have no more of the item in stock.

IKEA,Terrible experience with Ikea.,"Terrible experience with Ikea.I ordered a desk, bin, shelves and a jar on June 30th for a 19th August delivery date (it was the earliest they offered) - a slot that I paid for. It never showed up and the tracking didn't change from the day of dispatch.I tried to contact customer service via phone 3 times only to be thrown off the queue after 35+ minutes of waiting. I sent numerous emails, Twitter messages, tweets and Facebook messages with no response.When I finally got though on the phone, I was told that the desk was out of stock but the other items could still be delivered to me. I said no, I want the whole order cancelled and refunded.1. Why wasn't I contacted? I had booked a time slot on the 19th August and had no contact whatsoever from Ikea to say that the item wasn't available.2. Why weren't my other items delivered to me on the 19th August?Customer service worker was nice about it, she apologised. She had no explanation for why I wasn't contacted as there wasn't one - it's just neglectful. If a small business took a customers money and didn't deliver the products with no contact whatsoever they would be ruined, this isn't acceptable.They knew it was out of stock on the 30th June, they had just under an entire month to tell me this and didn't.

IKEA,1.5 months out atm and nothing has been delivered,"I first tried to place an order about 5 months ago and the computer program wasn't working properly, with availability varying from moment to moment, and so I called customer service directly. After 30+ minute I finally got through and spent the next hour with the rep who kept thinking they could get the items I requested, but every single attempt failed, and so in the end they recommended I try again in 2 weeks, which I kept on doing over the course of ~2 months.Finally, the items showed as available for delivery, and so I place the $1,700 order and scheduled the earliest delivery date that was 12 days out. I was informed that the delivery company would contact me and provide updates on the status of the delivery, which they did using an app that showed how the process was proceeding. I took off from work on the day of stated delivery, was given a 9am-9pm delivery window, and in the morning the app showed everything was set, but just not out for delivery, so I waited until 7pm and called the freight company and was informed that I needed to wait until 9pm. Well the delivery wasn’t made, so again I checked the app the next morning and it showed it was out for delivery, so I took another day off, but since I am here writing this highly negative review, you can surmise it never showed up. This was particularly upsetting as most of the items were for my 84 year old dad, who ended up sleeping on an air mattress for an evening as we dissembled his bed after we saw the order was out for delivery, and naturally he was quite disappointed it never showed up.What followed were hours of unproductive phone calls over days, where the freight company blamed IKEA for not releasing their “hard hold” on the merchandise, who then said I needed to contact IKEA and resolve this, and in return with IKEA claiming the freight company had lost the items in their own warehouse.It is important to realize that both parties expected me to be the intermediary on their behalf in repeated phone call over days, and that each time I had to again contact IKEA the process took hour for each call that did finally connect, with the majority of calls leading one through a voice menu maze, which would then flat out tell you they could not answer your call at this time. Also, they really need to change their on-hold messages, as repeatedly telling the customer how simple and efficient the online ordering process is, and prodding them to go online instead (which gives one no resolution options), is infuriating.After all was said and done I easily spent over 8 hours total between IKEA and their designated freight company, with each blaming the other, only to finally have IKEA admit that it was their fault, and they simply didn’t have the items after all. I said to one of their reps, “I am going to ask to a straightforward question, is there any system in place to inform the customer that their order isn’t actually going to be delivered?”, to which he flatly replied “No”, and I laughed saying, “Well at least that’s an honest answer”. A subsequent interaction was, far worse with a different rep attempting to assign blame on me stating that I should have known that their system sends out an email confirming the order has been successfully processed, to which I pointed out I was also told that the freight company would inform me of delivery status, which they did, resulting in 2 days of lost work. She then continued the cycle of blaming the freight company, without accepting any responsibility of IKEA who of course should be overseeing the entire process involved in making sure their products are actually in stock, and are being actually delivered when their designated freight provider informs the customer of the pending delivery. Also note that the one go to option the reps kept pushing was to just cancel the order, obviously to take this issue off of their plate.So 1.5 months out from the original scheduled delivery date, I have received nothing, not a single item from the order, I have received no notification of status or redelivery scheduling, and I am quite convinced that no one even knows my order exists in the computer system as I have been specifically informed that there is no system in place to inform customers on delivery delays.IKEA is undoubtedly the worst online shopping experience I have ever encountered, with representatives that are functionally incapable of resolution options other than simply canceling the order, who don’t take primary responsibility for their incompetence, and are at times aggressively argumentative.",0,1

IKEA,No customer service to help!,"Bought a food container in glass that exploded. Tried to contact customer service online but I'm forced to fill in date, receipt and such which I don't have. Then I'm not allowed to go through with it. So I thought I would call them but then a voice tells me they only help online! So I can not (!!!) contact them! Shame in you! The only way as I see it is a) visit their store again and bring it or b) put the exploded glass together with a handwritten letter and pay for stamps etc and send it to their headquarters????? Really!!!!! I'm really upset with their unavailable customer service! And what about old people who might not even know how to use internet?",0,1

I really don't want to spend 30 minutes in a queue to get in, a further 30 minutes meandering around behind groups of bored teenagers and to finally get to the location and there's something completely different there!IKEA should be avoided at present at its just a shambles.GET A GRIP IKEA!!!",0,1

Went to the Edinburgh store and ordered everything except 4 pieces which were out of stock. Paid and organised delivery and was told to keep looking online for the other pieces to come into stock. Did this and phoned to add on to order. After 2 very long calls (on hold for 45 minutes each) I thought it was all sorted. Last Thursday the 4 additional pieces arrived at the house. The rest was to be collected from Aberdeen on Sunday. Call received late Sunday morning to say nothing had arrived as there was some mix up. After another very long wait on the phone I had a very unhelpful call with customer services, only to be told by the very bored sounding Ikea employee that it was a stock issue and some of the pieces were now out of stock!!! How could this be.....they were in stock at the time of payment so surely they should have been aside with my name on it?? It wasn't my fault that they couldn't deliver to Aberdeen sooner and I certainly wouldn't have expected that they would just go ahead and resell the units. The bored guy on the phone said....could be November.....or maybe next year!! But basically he really couldn't care less. So I am now £1200 out of pocket and have no idea what's happening because no one has been in touch with me since the Case was raised (whatever that means!!) I am probably going to have to take a day off work to go down yet again to sort this out and get my money back.

While redoing my studio I put in a order online in the middle of August, to be delivered to my local pick up point September 9. I received a confirmation that my order was processed & so I waited to be notified when it was ready for me to pick it up. September 9 came & went, nothing, then September 10, I received an email containing a refund statement for the whole order. No explanation, apology or anything. So I phoned the one customer service number & waited an hour & 15 minutes before talking to a representative. He was pleasant enough but sounded very resigned to the whole situation without being able to give me any explanation for them completely dropping the ball. He quoted my return would be processed in 5-7 days on my visa, but gave me a case number to follow up with if that didn’t happen! So disappointed in this whole process, I waited weeks for a order that didn’t even leave the warehouse without any notice from IKEA at all. Poor, poor customer service. Such a shame I really do love their products but if I can’t get it to my city, what’s the point. I don’t live in the boonies, I live in the Capital city of Victoria, BC Canada.

I try the chat, takes nearly an hour, person needs me to transfer to sales. Takes almost 40 minutes. Sales on the other end tells me there was an unexpected delay and it needs to be rescheduled for four days later. I asked why there wasn't even a courtesy call to let me know at the start of the day and I had people hired to move and assemble this furniture (it was furniture for the whole house), and even a normal person cannot be expected to figure this out automatically. The agent took a very cavalier ""take it or leave it attitude"" - with no guarantee to meet the next date, unable to change it to click and collect, and the possible refund taking an approximately 15 business days (I had already explained to him this was ~3k of furniture and if I have to re order, I can't wait three weeks in an empty house). I lost my temper a few times and used colorful language (never directing them at the agent though). I have NEVER went to that level with ANY customer support, all my life.He would only offer me a ""negotiable"" amount of IKEA gift card and if IKEA fails again. I have had so many good memories from this location, but this one incident will always leave me bitter.",0,1

IKEA,When ordering online at IKEA,"My order was cancelled on their end the week it was to arrive. This is 6 weeks after I placed my order. I called and spoke to someone in “customer service”. She said I could go to the store near me and attempt to purchase my order on Wednesday before they sold out. I work and getting there early on a Wednesday is not an option for the average worker. I asked them if I could secure the item for pickup on Wednesday they said they could not and had no resolution they could assist with. But I would receive a refund after 14 days. I called today after more then 14 days. I was on the phone for an hour again. I was told it can take up to 3 weeks or longer. In the email I received it stated 14 days, the women told me it said business days, I assured her it did not and I would be happy to send her over the email. She declined but the same issue still remains. My refund has not been sent, my order was cancelled on their end and I have never received such poor customer service. I am over it IKEA and will never shop there again. I just want my $300.00 dollars back. To have my money for almost 3 months and to have a company be in no rush to give it back after I had to go out and repurchase the originally items is extremely irritating. So if you would like to have a store hold your money for 3+months interest free and waste hours on the phone then order online from IKEA!",0,1

As reported the queues were massive around the car park but this was well after stores were allowed to reopen. Waited early am for 1 hour and decided to leave the queue with the intention of coming back later only to find the same queue but longer late afternoon.

Asked for manager to say all we want is two small shelves which were actually an exchange and could we just get them but told no.

IKEA,Sent wrong color doors and have made it impossible to contact them.,"We have purchased (and assembled ourselves) 3 IKEA kitchens. I do really like their kitchen cabinets. However, their customer service is non existent. Our IKEA built-in microwave oven broke down so we ordered a different oven. We had to modify the IKEA cabinet that the oven is in, and needed different size doors. As the kitchen system (SEKTION) is still being produced and the color name was identical to the kitchen we had purchased (GRIMSLÖV), we thought this would be easy. We were warned that the doors would take a long time (took about 6 weeks). However, when we got the doors they were the wrong color. I still had an extra deco piece still in the box, so I'm positive I got the color correct. GRIMSLÖV is a medium reddish brown brown, but the doors we were sent were a dark chestnut brown. The two colors are not even close. I attempted to contact IKEA, but ""due to heavy call volume"" they hung up on me. I couldn't even leave my number for a call back. I thought, okay I'll email them. On their website they are only taking emails for canceled orders! So they are making it impossible to contact them. I sent an order cancelation anyway, but I don't hold out any hope that they'll respond. I tried to find another email or phone number where I could talk to a person but no luck so far.If you are near an IKEA store (i.e. don't have to rent a hotel), then perhaps the customer service may not be so bad as you can go in person.

That is terrible, terrible customer service that basically shows how little they care for the people trying to buy their products.",0,1

IKEA,"Very concerned, people not wearing masks","Very concerned about the amount of people not wearing face masks and staff not asking / reminding people they need to wear them at the Croydon store. Personally I don’t feel safe there, on a 30 minute trip I saw 20 customers or more not wearing masks and that does include children or people wearing the masks around their necks. That said a lot of people did wear masks (Well done) but the staff should be trained to tell people that they need to wear face masks. I won’t be going back as I can not justify the health risk.",0,2
IKEA,Rubbish service and worthless guarantee on Ikea kitchen,"I have had my kitchen for 9 years and although delivery was appalling and there were bits missing or broken, we put it together ourselves and were pleased with the result. However, three years ago I complained that some of the door and draw fronts were peeling. I expected them to be replaced as it came with 25 year guarantee. Not worth the paper it’s written on! Was told it was because there had been water near them. ITS A KITCHEN!!!! water does get used in a kitchen. I said I wasn’t expecting the whole kitchen to be replaced, just those with damage. Not only would they not do that free of charge, they wouldn’t let me buy them either even though they had spares which they said were for people with faulty doors/drawer fronts. THATS EXACTLY WHAT MINE IS but no joy from them at all. Furious and ☹️",0,1
IKEA,Still Haven't Received My Order,"There are no words to express how utterly disappointed I am in IKEA and your handling of your online orders. It is absolutely understandable that you have had to make logistical changes to your operation during a time like this; however, a lack in handling of proper customer service is not only damaging to your consumer and reputation but also to your employees who are trying to cope with all of this. I placed my order on May 4th, and I have been patiently waiting to receive it. I even tried to cancel the order because word had arrived that the stores would be reopening, and for that time frame, I could just make the purchase at the store. I was excited to receive a notification back in June that my order was shipping only for the tracking of the package to be stagnate in Lakeland, FL. I have had no communication at all nor been able to reach anyone from IKEA since placing or attempting to cancel my order. Yesterday, August 12th, I received a notification that my order had been delivered. Nothing was at my door and upon checking my package tracking, the same indication that my package has not left Lakeland, FL is in fact still there. I find it ironic that this survey has been sent for me to share my experience concerning a customer service conversation that I have not had with anyone. I would in the very least like a refund if you are not going to send my package. As an alternative, I'm willing to pick the items up from my local IKEA store in Atlanta. What I will not do is continue to wait for IKEA to decide that I, a consumer who used to advocate for IKEA and its products, am to be disregarded as nothing more than a money grab. By all means, share this with the individual(s) who are in charge of this mess.",0,1

Online I tried over 3 days to buy a Hafslo mattress. The first day it kept bugging out when trying to check out the item. The next day I managed to get to the checkout but the only checkout option was to collect from their Tottenham store - 50 miles away. Even though there are half a dozen stores closer, all with stock of the item. Yesterday, getting slightly impatient I drove to the store only to be faced with a 2 mile long queue. Today I have tried again to purchase the mattress only for the little revolving sofa animation to repeat itself endlessness in the checkout without actually doing anything. Hmm. Definitely think I will give their website a miss from now on.",0,1

IKEA,Unprofessional,"Bought a table of Ikea.com and it was supposed to arrive in a few days. After about a month of waiting, it still had not arrived. I wondered what the problem was and I looked up if they were having trouble mailing to my area. I found a social media post by them saying that they are having trouble and almost all the comments were from costumers saying Ikea had not delivered their items. I saw another social media post very similar on facebook. They claimed their issues delivering are due to the virus, but the first social media post was from 2 years ago. I finally got a refund after contacting the better business bureau about the problem. When I had contacted Ikea directly on the phone, a robot said the line was busy and then hung up. When I contacted them on social media, I never got a response. Ikea later sent me a $20 gift card as a way to make things better I guess, but It didn't even work. If they can not deliver items they should not be offering that as a part of their business. Very unprofessional. Also, if do accept payment with no intent on actually giving the buyer their item, they are no better than thieves.",0,1

Our local store said there were 18 in stock so my husband went to return only the bottom since I bought the lid and container separately. When he got there there were none available. When I have tried to reach out to get customer service on the phone I get a recording saying they are too overwhelmed and then get hung up on. This is not ok.

I never received a single phone call, or contact of any kind, to help sort the issue out.Finally after many calls (no answer due to Covid) and making 2 formal complaints threatening legal action by email (neither receiving any reply/contact) and after 4 months, the refund was paid. Again, without any notification or any contact whatsoever.Oh, and to help apologise and make amends... they simply closed my online account with them (They managed to send me an email confirming that!)Shockingly bad.",0,1

Here we are in August and they are still not replaced. I have boxes of doors which have just been left abandoned in my house since March 2020. They have not only been impossible to contact but ignore multiple emails. Now they are refusing to replace the doors. They have the 2nd worst customer service in the whole world. First being another company selling furniture up North. I will never ever buy anything ever from IKEA ever again. Please please please avoid buying a kitchen from them. Go to Howdens anyone else. If anything goes wrong they don't care. They are slow, inefficient and don't communicate with each other departments. You will likely end up like me with faulty shoddy kitchen doors, then get left in the limbo for months on end.",0,1

IKEA,I used to be a loyal customer but will…,"I used to be a loyal customer but will not be using Ikea ever again. We needed to exchange some wardrobes and processed the exchange on July 7th. On the date of exchange we have ZERO communication form Ikea and nothing turn up. So I waited in all day for nothing. When I got in contact with them they told me there was no stock. To clarify I had to wait an hour on the phone after waiting in all day to be told this. Rebooked the exchange. Called two days prior to check the delivery would take place. Again waited on the phone for over an hour - when I got through I was told there was no stock and the exchange wouldn't be taking place. If I hadn't of rung I would have spent all day waiting in again for no delivery. Rebooked the exchange again. I called Monday - waited an hour and a half on the phone to be told the exchange would take place. Called yesterday to double check, again confirmed it was taking place and to call back at tea time to get a delivery time. Used the web chat at tea time, waited an hour to connect to someone who told me there was no delivery date or time on our order and she then ended the chat. Called Ikea was on hold for 90mins with no answer. Called Ikea this morning at 7am - the exchange took place at 8.40am and guess what - the wrong items were exchanged based on what they had on their sheet. I've been offered as compensation a £20 E-Voucher to spend in store. No refund for the time I have taken off work to try and resolve this. Whilst I appreciate COVID has affected all businesses your communication strategy is diabolical. I will be taking this higher as this is genuinely the worst customer service I have ever received.

Tried to contact them again. No answer. Then I started to receive reminders with extra costs.After months and months of trying I finally got the products returned and received a confirmation that it was received and refunded. Klarna told me that the money was refunded but I never got the money.Ikea does not respond. Klarna can't help and Segoria (which is Klarna but says it isn't) claims money from me while I have never ordered it and I don't even poses the products anymore.

I asked for an exchange she said she was happy to do that and when I requested a refund for delivery as this mattress clearly was falsely advertised she turned round and said ""nah"". With that same employee she gave me a number to call to pay the difference for the exchange therefore I hung up after being on the phone for 75 minutes to realise she gave me the same number I was just calling on! Disaster strikes.. I had to spend my afternoon attempting to wrap my poorly advertised mattress in bin liners and upon finishing I'd wasted hours of my time. This is where it gets juicy, I FINALLY paid the difference which took me two days to do as first the payment system was down and the following day all phone lines were down. When I finally got through I paid and then received an email to say my payment was late which means the exchange has been delayed, delayed!!! through no fault of mine! their systems were down and now I'm paying the price.Overall, If you've got some change in your pocket save up a little longer and go somewhere decent and save yourself the pain and misery of talking to employees from IKEA.",0,1

Following the delivery issue directions to call leaves you with a message that ""we are experiencing high call volumes and cannot take your call"" with no option to get a callback, email or anything. If you try to email, only option is to cancel an order..oh and you have 48 hours to report an issue or they consider the order complete. hmmm So called back and chose the option to place an order..OH Wow, what a surprise, a human answers when you want to place an order but not when you have an issue. The customer service agent was very helpful and processed a replacement...but the ship date didn't get communicated until 2 days later and it is 3 weeks out. REALLY? So now sleeping on a mattress on the floor until they get around to delivering it. Can only hope it will be right. Also, no apology, no offer of a store coupon or credit against the order for the inconvenience. If they had showed one ounce of apology for the issue, I would not be nearly as upset.

IKEA,The stores are packed at weekends,The stores are packed at weekends - a mass of people and no social distancing in place. Lines of people waiting for food service again right on top of each other. I do understand how the stores can stay open under these dire health conditions! Restrictions in numbers - line markers and arrow following systems to abide by - more sanitisers as everyone touching the products - more needs to be done - shop online or don’t go!

IKEA,IKEA stole my money,"I am so frustrated. I placed my order back on May 6th 2020 and was expecting a delivery on May 25th. It never showed up. I tried calling for 6 weeks and I couldn’t reach anyone. I couldn’t even send them an email. Once I finally got through 6 weeks later, I was told that they were trying to locate my order but they themselves couldn’t get through and I had to call back (spent 50mins on phone). I called back a week later and they informed me that my order had been canceled on May 27th, 2020. I have no idea why they took it upon themselves to cancel my order and not send me any notice. The biggest problem is that they cancelled my order but NEVER refunded my money $185. I have since called twice was given a case number and been told I needed to wait 5-7 business days. It has now been 16 business days since my first phone call and they STILL have not refunded my money. I can’t even get through anymore. This is THEFT... they have stolen my money. I have never ever in my life dealt with a situation like this. I think they just hope that I will give up or forget.",0,1
IKEA,I like Ikea overall but not delivery,"I like Ikea overall. It is good if we buy and collect it on our own (self collection, self delivery etc) but not if we pay online and pay third party ie in my case Poslaju to deliver to my place which is the only reasonable option i have. The problem is if I am not at home, the Poslaju will not deliver the package again and asked me to self collect it from their office. It does not serve any purpose as I've paid delivery fees. Thus, it is best if Ikea would review their delivery options.",0,3

So they are “looking” into it. Not expecting much. Can’t get ahold of IKEA at all. No email, no phone or chat. I will probably never buy anything from this company again. I use to love this company but now I feel untrusting of them. I would just like to know if my order is somewhere out there. I paid a decent delivery fee too for this one patio table.",0,2

Finally get the stuff ordered and it’s delivered with 2 items missing. Called their customer services waited 35 minutes on hold, only to get cut off when I did get through. Phoned back - they’ve closed the call centre due to volume of calls. The webchat is also offline and there is no email option. So I now have no way to contact them and get the items that I’ve already paid for. Last time I buy from Ikea. You can see from the other reviews this isn’t an isolated incident, they just offer rubbish customer service.",0,1

IKEA,Insanely bad experience,"Insanely bad experience. Ikea was out of stock on several items in my cart and since they don't have any ability to order items and wait for them to come in stock, I waited almost 2 months to put the order in. I finally was able to order the full kitchen in early July. The delivery date from Ikea was set for July 24. Next thing I know, the delivery service (XPO Delivery) randomly showed up at my door with my order on July 22. ""Hello this is your Ikea delivery. We are at your house."" No one was home. ""Why are you there? The delivery is scheduled for July 24."" ""We are here now. Do you want us to leave everything in your driveway?"" ""No, it's going to rain.""""Ok, you will need to reschedule the delivery."" That night I got ""Your delivery was a success!"" confirmation emails from both Ikea and XPO. This entire time, due to Covid-19, Ikea was not taking any customer service calls or emails - only emails to cancel orders. I called XPO. They said only Ikea can reschedule the delivery and I need to wait. I wait for a week. Nothing. I call XPO back and the XPO rep says they have a new delivery date of August 7. I am annoyed but at least the delivery is set.On August 5, I get a ""Delivery rescheduled"" confirmation email for Sunday *August 9*. I call and ask what happened to August 7? XPO says they don't know but the delivery is definitely Sunday, August 9. ""The delivery is scheduled for some time between 9am and 9pm.""Today is August 9. I called XPO twice during the day to confirm the delivery was on its way. ""Yes, they are in transit.""After sitting at home all day waiting for the delivery (on a Sunday), at 8:35pm I called XPO to get a status. ""Oh yes, your order is not coming today.""""WHY NOT?!""""I have no more information. I will transfer you to Ikea to reschedule the delivery.""...""You're hold time for the next Ikea representative is...75 minutes.""So I am writing this as I wait on hold with Ikea. I fully expect to be disconnected before someone answers, or they are going to say ""XPO has your order. You must talk to them to reschedule.""Meanwhile, this has gone on so long, I have lost the contractor who was scheduled to install everything, as they had to move on to other jobs.I want to cut some slack to businesses in these difficult times, but screwing up the date 4 times, with absolutely no recourse and terrible/no communication is ridiculous. And to make someone sit at home on a weekend and wait for a delivery that never comes - after confirming multiple times it's on its way - is beyond maddening. If this ever gets resolved, it will be my last Ikea purchase for a loooong, loooong time.",0,1
IKEA,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service ever. Tried multiple times, and multiple ways, to purchase an ottoman.When I called customer service and was told it was out-of-stock, I was also told I would receive an email when it was in stock. I never received such an email even though I noted on the website it was back in stock. I went back to the store only to find it was mysteriously closed without any notification on the website. Returned home and decided to order online. Called numerous times to check status of order and each customer service rep told me something that contradicted the prior person. Finally received an email it would be delivered on a set date. Well, on that date, the doorbell did ring and a driver from Ikea was at the door. The driver had a small package. It was the fabric for the ottoman and not the ottaman! Spent three hours trying to reach customer service. Finally reached a human who said it was on backorder. Yet my email confirmation of the order I placed indicated the entire ottoman would be arriving. Not the fabric!!!! I did not spend $215 to buy a piece of fabric. Will NEVER shop with IKEA again.

IKEA,Ikea Order # 356488809,"Ikea Order # 356488809 - Customer service file #230 - 20529996 -My experience with Ikea is so heartless and so horrible! First off I ordered my items last June 8, 2020. And the delivery should have been on July 12 but until now we’re on July 30 and still the delivery company of Ikea which is XPO logistics is screwing up in delivering my items. They re-scheduled me for 2nd time on a Sunday afternoon, I received a call from delivery driver a day before to confirm and I thought it’s going to be successfully delivered this time , but then on that day , I waited again for nothing, wasting 4 hours of my time . I could have gone somewhere for my other errands. I called up the driver who called me a day before because their customer service in XPO is closed on a Sunday and now his reason was that the delivery truck got broken and so my parcel had to be transferred to another truck with a different driver! Why they didn’t inform me?! I really don’t understand why! And so the next business day , tried to reach Ikea Customer Service , they rescheduled me again for the 3rd time, again I waited and spent 4 hours of my time at home waiting in vain for the 3rd time . This time they couldn’t give me an answer. I’m literally losing my patience already of their false hopes and false reassurances. I reached them out in Social media fb and instagram but seems like they don’t care and don’t really read my concerns. They keep on asking for my order # and keep on saying apologies but the problem is not being fixed at all. And now still giving them a chance for the fourth time to re-schedule me for today Thursday July 30, I called up XPO an hour prior to my delivery time frame to make sure , the agent said my parcel is already loaded in the truck, it’s on its way and that they’re shouldn’t be any problem. So I got an alert at 1pm that they’re coming in 30 minutes , 2pm passed , still nothing arrives. 3 pm passed and I’m still waiting, I called up again , and the agent said just wait since driver still has 5pm to arrive. So as usual, 5 pm passed but none came. I called up again , and now this is the shocking answer of the agent , “I’m sorry but you’re parcel won’t be delivered today unfortunately because the driver didn’t able to find your order..”-What!!!? Are u kidding me?!Now they have two contrary statements from previous agent. I mean what kind of service is this?! It’s not easy to wait on queue to speak to someone who can help when no one actually wants to help. I have to wait for so long just to reach someone, I’m trying to ask for a Supervisor to call me back but no one did. They only want you to call their Customer Service hotline that’s gonna make you wait for years and they just put u on hold . I don’t understand why no one from any of them is calling me back when I already told them my availability which is 7pm onwards everyday. The worst part for today that’s making me mad right now is I took a day off from work! Just for this delivery that’s not happening, who is going to compensate me for the hours of work that I lost ??

Typically I prefer to praise positive experiences over pointing the finger at things that don't go as intended, and with everything that's taking place with COVID, this is even more the case. That said, after paying for expedited 3 day shipping on May 28th, having multiple customer service agents make commitments that weren't met, more than 10 hours on the phone between my partner and I continually being pushed to different departments without any resolution about where our items are or how we can address this problem this has been without a doubt, the worst customer experience I've ever had. I can appreciate and understand challenges with delivery, items being lost or life happening, but the utter disregard for customer experience in this case is very surprising for a company that I used to think took this type of experience seriously. While I don't imagine it means much to the organization, I genuinely hope that others choose to shop elsewhere instead of going through this.",0,1

After 12 minutes, I spoke to a representative who told me she had to redirect me to a colleague because her software was stuck and she abruptly did just that. She put me in the back of a queue of 23 minutes now without any warning. My phone bill keeps running in the mean time.Update: ended the call after being left on hold for over an hour.",0,1

I called NAL and IKEA and rescheduled it for July 22. I received an email today that I need to schedule it again with dates July 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. I called to state it had already been scheduled for July 22, Tuesday, and was told it had not been and that date was not available. I was also told that none of the above mentioned dates were available after I had just received the email one minute ago. I was told the earliest date was August 3. This is totally ridiculous. I spent a very long time on hold yesterday to schedule this delivery and was told by both NAL and IKEA that this date was available and my delivery had been scheduled. The person, I talked to, Brittany, was very condescending and not the least bit helpful in why this mix up has hapenned. Just to state ""we are a very busy company"". This is very poor customer service. Why would I be told my delivery was scheduled for July 22 by two people only to receive an email to schedule it for the above dates to only be told by Brittany that those dates were not available either????????One very unhappy customer!",0,1

The customer service was non existent. Retail is struggling at the minute and I know why!! Very disappointing.

IKEA,Shocking Delivery Service! No contact! No show!,"very unhappy with Ikea..went into store, ordered and paid for including delivery for Sunday..rang me that evening to confirm address but never turned up..I couldnt get through to an agent until Tuesday. They said they may have just picked the stuff for me late on Sunday which is why it was too late to then deliver on set time 1-7pm on that day. Agent changed delivery day/time with me to Thursday 7am-1pm..Again I wait all day and no one turns up. I got through to an agent yesterday afternoon who told me he directly rang the courrier himself, the courier said a delivery man hadnt turned up for work that morning so they were running late with my order and now it wouldnt be out till sometime before 6pm but that the courrier was enroute to me so I would definitely get it. Again it was a no show! Was on the phone to an agent in England this morning for 1 hour. She got in touch with the store and the customer service manager needs to go down to the warehouse and check this out for me and will ring me then. Hours have passed now and still no word. This is appalling service. I paid for the goods and the items to be picked and delivered on Sunday..I'm now waiting all week. This has been a complete waste of my time. I can't even use my phone as I'm constantly waiting for call backs which could be any hour of the day!",0,1

Otherwise you might see a ""request callback"" option which is sporadically available.

We got sick of eating rust from it, reported to Ikea Logan, but they denied to accept our complaint and didn’t let us exchange to other material. Complained to IKEA help line, but they were honestly rude. Honestly we were big fans of Ikea but now have no feeling to buy anything from ikea. Even had plans to buy full bath and kitchens (worthy $30,000) for our new home, but now will buy somewhere else. Idiot customer service and bad attitude staff.",0,1
IKEA,Seriously deteriorated products and services,"Used to like Ikea for all sorts of things but over the years have found quality deteriorating and the service is become just shocking. Most recently 2 terrible experiences that have left me an ex-customer 1) Wanted to replace an item we had that has just got past it used by date and has started to break apart - it was cheap so in itself not a drama. It becomes expensive though when you make the effort to go online and check stock levels and when the item is highlighted as green and in stock (not even yellow i.e. low stock) we drive the kms to the store only to find that they have none there - not 1…so from plenty of stock to none in 1 hour? Speaking to a ""Service"" person there we were told we should have CALLED the store before coming over - really!??? 2) I received a $10 voucher for having spent in January - March. Got a ""reminder"" (noting this was the FIRST notification I had received) a week before it expired. Tried to order the item online (that was not in stock at the store we had just been to) the online checkout said it was not valid. Tried to call the store - no answer. Tried to use their online form - and noted the timeline - only to get no answer. Tried again - noting the first enquiry to which I had no response…. (this is now after the voucher expired) - finally get an answer 19 days after I first tried to get help to be told ""We provide a voucher each quarter via email to your email address and you then have 3 months to use this voucher. Once this period has expired we can no longer honor this voucher.""Clearly they did not read my first, or even second contact ion any meaningful way so I respond to cancel my Ikea Family membership and have all my details removed from their system. Interestingly on this one got a response in less than 48 hours cancelling. Car factor in their response - zero!",0,1

BUT, given these COVID-19 times, what was most distressing was the fact that the tables were dirty. Not just one or two but many, many tables were dirty. Lots of other tables had dirty dishes piled high. No one whatsoever was seen cleaning the tables either and the venue was packed. I’m sure IKEA makes enough money that they can employ people to clean the tables. No one wants or expects to eat at a dirty table. I used anti bacterial wipes to clean our tables before eating.I won’t be eating at IKEA again.Get your act together IKEA. The dirty conditions of the food hall were unsatisfactory, unhygienic and a health disaster waiting to happen. I felt sick to the stomach.",0,1

I went on the 20 minute walk only to be told it was scheduled but never delivered. Called the spot the next day (today) and apparently it’s scheduled to be delivered tomorrow. I’m currently on hold, attempting to understand what kind of circus they’re running (an hour and 36 mins + counting).There’s honestly no excuse for this customer service.

Rang service, waited 40 mins on hold, eventually go on and they told me they would contact Toll and get back to me. That never happened. Parcel attempted delivery and marked as delivered.

We took different table pieces to the help desk to make sure they would fit together. The employee checked the compatability in the computer and told us the two pieces would work together to make a table. We got it home and the pieces do not work together. Their employees don't care and they don't do their jobs well. Do not trust anything that they tell you, take things out of the boxes and check them out yourself. Although I wouldn't recommend shopping there at all. The rest of the employees throughout the Denver store were equally inept and unwilling to help.",0,1

When we asked for the key, a member of staff from customer services, went to fetch it from the office. She returned saying the office was locked and I would have to use the other one on the other side of the store. Luckily, I could wait. Surely the key should be at customer services. At the checkout, my shopping was thrown across so I could pack my things. This was while she was chatting another member of staff and looking at photos on her phone. Then instead of telling me how much I needed to pay, she told my friend! I replied with, ""I'm here!""There was no smile or apology.I used my wheelchair as I can only walk with crutches at the moment and I knew I wouldn't be able to make it around the store otherwise.I have experienced the difficulties that people with a disability face and I am appalled at what they have to go",0,2
IKEA,"AWFUL ""Customer Service""","I ordered a Closet Unit and 3-tiered Cart on 5/22 and scheduled my delivery for 7/3 when I originally placed the order. I took a day off of work to ensure I was home for the deliver which is stated to be between 9AM - 9PM. I got 3 emails (1 the week before, and 2 the morning before) stating that my delivery would arrive on 7/3. On the morning of 7/3, I called the Delivery Company (Select Express & Logistics) to see if they had a more accurate time for my delivery (morning, afternoon, or evening). I was not told until that morning that my ordered had arrived from Ikea to their location the day before and DID NOT make it on the truck to be delivered on 7/3. I was immediately angry because I had gotten several reminder emails from Ikea saying everything was on track and to expect my delivery on 7/3. When I talked to the Delivery Company they said I wouldn't get it until Monday 7/6. I argued with them for a while and then asked who would be refunding my delivery fee, paying my lost wages for taking the day off because you have to be there to accept your delivery, or who they were going to pay OT to in order to ensure my delivery made it to my house either on 7/3 or 7/4. They wouldn't help and wouldn't let me speak to a Supervisor. They told me to call Ikea. So I called Ikea and got transferred to the ""after sales customer service team"". The woman was awful - wouldn't listen, wouldn't help and I asked her all of those same three questions above. She also wouldn't let me speak to a Supervisor. She said there was no way that they would refund my delivery fee or do anything else I asked. So basically they were going to do nothing for me - No Customer Service! She said I didn't have to take the day off of work because they call to give you a window time. Really? Because I had to call on that morning just to be told that my order wasn't even coming until Monday, July 6th! Why does Ikea allow you to pick your delivery date on their site when you order a product from them IF THEY AREN'T GOING TO DELIVER ON THAT DAY - AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE HOME THAT IS OVER 18! If there was a back up or any type of issue due to COVID then call me and let me know that you need to reschedule so that I don't lose wages! I shouldn't have to call you just to be told that they aren't delivering. I would've NEVER known they weren't coming on 7/3, had I not called that morning to find out when my delivery was supposed to arrive (morning, afternoon, or evening). It was the WORST ""Customer Solutions"" experience EVER! Seriously, rent a U-Haul and go to the store to pick it up yourself. It's not worth the large delivery fee and bs that you go through just to get the order on time after waiting OVER A MONTH! I could've gotten it MUCH SOONER and not went through all this bs!",0,1

IKEA,WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"If i could give zero stars or negative stars i would. I had a very similar experience as one of the other reviewers. Ordered almost $600 worth of outdoor tiles.

There was NO ONE on the calls for customer service. Finally two weeks ago (a month from when i ordered) they said it would be delivered July 11th. But nothing has been processed yet. I have no faith that it will be delievered by Saturday the 11th. I specifically ordered this for a few summer gatherings (including a graduation). IKEA fell off in the worst way.

Because it was before 10a EST she advised that I had to call back later to get more information or reschedule delivery. Ridiculous that this is their process. I phoned back at 10a and got an automated message advising that my call could not be completed. I tried again and received another message advising that due to high inquiry volumes they cannot take calls at this time. I tried five minutes later and was given the same message.

Anyway, I tried several times to contact IKEA on the customer service number and my call was refused when I used the menu directions for delivery problems. So I used the menu item for new orders and customer service immediately answered my call. I reported the problem to the representative and she transferred me and I was on hold for 30 minutes. Then someone picked up and I told them about the problem and they put me on hold for another 15 minutes. Finally they said they would send me 5 more sets of hinges.

What, does Ikea do; chop the tree and process the wood to make cardboard on site before they can make a box? Next, it has shipped, as of the 26th... yeah! Only when checking tracking as of the 4th, it still shows they are creating a label, so it hasn't shipped, and apparently they need to chop down another tree to make the paper for the label.

It makes no sense why they're forcing customers to go into the store to make a purchase, especially when they have had the months of April, May, June to make adjusts (+3 months if anyone is counting). More than 3 months and yet they can't get their act together. I was going to purchase 2 stefan chairs and chair pads ($70?). Honestly, I feel that is overpriced, but whatever. When trying to order on website it won't let me place the order for Click&Connect pickup at store, or for delivery. So, instead I went to my local Costco type warehouse store and got 2 chairs I like for $44. The only way this behavior on Ikea's part makes any sense logically is: they just don't care about us customers. They could of easily setup a store pickup system in 3 months and hired extra people for it. They just don't care about their customers, or our business. They are making the assumption that the people who are super loyal to Ikea will keep going there, no matter what.",0,1
IKEA,Avoid at all costs,Avoid at all costs! Having a terrible experience with online ordering with IKEA!! Ordered something estimated to be delivered May 25 it is now July and haven't even received an update on new delivery date. Also Placed an $800 order that was estimated to be delivered June 25th and haven't received any notification for delivery on these items either. Attempting to call or email is impossible IKEA Does not even give you the option to speak with someone directly over the phone and the only thing you can email about is canceling an order. So now we have no choice but to cancel our $800 order. Even considering the times IKEA should still have some way to get in contact with someone or keep you informed if your delivery will be delayed. Absolutely terrible - will never order from IKEA again.,0,1

IKEA,Abysmal in store customer experience,"Visited ikea southampton today to return a faulty bed frame, i have the receipt and the purchase is within the fabled 365 days NO NONSENSE return policy that they proudly display in the customer service area, so i was confident that as the bed frame was faulty this would be a smooth experience , i had planned to purchase other items on my visit and also enquire about a new kitchen suite as we are in the process of building an extension to ours.Since the lockdown lifted there seems to be new procedures in place understandably of course, however this doorman/schoolboy on the door (must be new) because he had no idea about there own return policies and kept getting lost for words, wouldn't even let me through the door, what a joke, i shall now be raising a formal complaint , Don't buy anything from ikea , the workmanship and quality is poor and you will have pot luck chance of returning it let alone speaking to someone qualified to do there job if there is a problem . The 365 day no nonsense return policy should be changed to 365 seconds return policy - meaning you goods can be returned up until you leave the car park . Zero star rating!!",0,1

Today having not received it we contacted them early in the morn. Today the excuse is orders are 24hrs behind ... obviously .... so where is my stuff ... they claimed it would be here today ... and now today is over, support is shut down refusing to take calls, web chat, etc. and our order is still in the wind.Companies listen upusing a pandemic as an excuse for crap business practice, lousy service and corner cutting is BS.

IKEA,AVOID IKEA Ireland online! Shocking delivery and customer service!,"I always thought IKEA was a reputable company, but will NEVER be ordering from them again after this. Waited at home all day for scheduled sofa delivery, then spent 3.5 hours (I am not joking) trying to get through to their customer support via phone and chat. When I get a response, they tell me it will probably come tomorrow and that they have delayed all deliveries by approx 24 hours (but have not told customers, despite having my correct email, phone, etc). I said I would like to make a complaint about not being informed of the delay and also about not being able to get through to customer service and they said that such a complaint would ""according to their strict matrix"" merit a 20 euro voucher but could not be further investigated. I told them to keep the voucher. No idea if and when the sofa will turn up, but the arrogance of this company has shocked me. I think they are perhaps using Covid as an excuse to lower standards/cut costs?",0,1

IKEA,Ikea's Customer Service Will Deter Me from Repurchasing,"One of the items in my delivery has a manufacturing defect (no pre-drilled holes for screws to be inserted into a table leg). I waited over 1.45 hours to be connected with Customer Service after having a very frustrating experience on the Ikea Chat. The Customer Service agent responded that a 1.45 hour wait was ""good these days."" I was told ""someone would call me to arrange delivery"" for a new table leg. Days passed however, no call. I had to wait over 50 minutes to be connected with someone on Ikea Chat who had a very delayed response time (almost 6-7 minutes each response) only to find out I had to be transferred to ""after sales"" department. There is no extensions to call specific departments within Ikea and they direct you to call the general number with very extensive wait-times. My issue remains unresolved. Very disappointing customer service experience overall.",0,1

At one time they’re going to send me shelves and doors for a wardrobes I will never receive-since they deleted them from my order.From late May, I started to receive the items, at the time of writing I have had four deliveries, two were of duplicate items and after all of that I’m still missing a shoe cabinet, this Includes today’s delivery, which I had to reject since I already told customer service that I have the items and I want to return the duplicate ones they sent. Of course, they have failed to inform the courier about the collection and my tiny place’s corridor is another IKEA store at the moment!My complaint is not about the delivery- we are going through a pandemic and totally understand that.Majority of the drivers we nice and helpful..it’s customer service that keep messing about in the backrooms, at one intense an agent told me my order was modified by a ‘ higher authority’ and he couldn’t undo that or go against management decisions. I clearly told them I don’t mind waiting as long I’m getting my items but receiving duplicates cluttering my limited space and no help from customer service is stressful and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to order form their until they get themselves together.After three hours wait.. I have been told by the agent I will be contacted to arrange the collection when the local store is open…it has been open since the beginning of the month, which he replied they don’t have permission to collect contradicting the statement from the last agent.Been horrible 3 months and counting .",0,1

IKEA,Conshohocken PA - you need a death wish to enter,"The Ikea in Conshohocken PA is now open, but do not enter unless you have a death wish. The store was way too crowded and at least 15% of the customer and one employee were either not wearing masks or had pulled down their mask so their nose was sticking out. One employee told me, ""what can we do if customers don't follow the rules?"" The answer is simple, kick them out of the store. Ikea's lack of oversight and enforcement has created a truly dangerous environment and I hope I survive the experience. I went from Ikea to Traders Joes. What a difference. In short, I went from one store which clearly does not care about the health of its customers to another which takes customer health seriously.

IKEA,Ridiculous service,"I have placed an online order on 7th of June with a promised delivery date of June 9th. I also booked an assembly service for 15th of June. This is what happened afterwards:- On June 9th, nothing arrived and nobody contacted me. I chatted with customer service and they said they could not do anything and I have to wait for Amsterdam IKEA to contact me! Since I had no idea when my order would arrive, obviously I had to re-book the assembly to a later date, which I did (27th of June)- My order arrived 1 week after the promised date. However, two items were missing, including a big working desk! Of course the delivery guys had no idea about it, it is not their fault so they couldn't help me.- I contacted customer service again. We booked the delivery of the remaining two items for Monday 22nd of June between 9.00 - 16.00- On Monday 22nd of June, around 15.30, I received a message saying that my order has been cancelled and they can not deliver that day. How the **** does my order get cancelled without me knowing, I have no idea!!!!!!- I kindly asked if I could add an item to my order (since it had arrived yet) and my request was rejected. I had to re-book the delivery for Wednesday 24th. Finally the two missing items arrived on that day.- The website states that I would have been contacted half an hour before the delivery of my orders but I was contracted in neither of the 2 orders I received. As you can guess, I am working from home and I had to step out of 2 different calls due to IKEA delivery!!!!! If I had known what time they would arrive, I would have arranged my schedule accordingly.- Now it's 27th of June, I was supposed to have assembly service today but I have no idea if they will come or at what time they will pop up. I can not reach customer service, I am tied to my house, having to wait for the slim chance that somebody shows up. This is ridiculous!

When the associate went to re-place the order, we were told the couch was now sold out. The associate told us our credit card would be credited for the $1,500 within a week of the call, which would have been June 5th. Here we are June 12th and I still have not received a credit. I've continued to call customer service and still receive dead ends. My tactic of trying to place a new order no longer works as well. Once I receive my credit, I do not plan on shopping at IKEA again.",0,1

IKEA,How does it make any sense that I have…,"How does it make any sense that I have to pay DKK 49 to pick up something from an IKEA warehouse? If I physically go to the warehouse and waste multiple employees' time and my own time waiting for the order to be ready for pickup, then it's for free.But if I waste noone's time and order the items online for pickup in an IKEA warehouse, then I have to pay extra?Where is the logic? How does it cost IKEA more that a customer orders and pays for the order online and then picks it up when the order is ready, rather than going there physically and having an employee order the item from the back shelves and then waiting in line?You could use these fees to make more effective use of your employees' time. No rather, it should be opposite: It should cost NOTHING to order a pickup form the IKEA website, but there should be a fee to order it in the warehouse. Both with Covid-19, but also generally, customers ought to be nudged into using self-service at ikea.com instead of wasting your own employees' precious time.",0,3

IKEA,Careless,"Bought a lovely lounge from Ikea yesterday from the As-Is section. There was damage on the underside but I was still happy with lounge and the discounted price, even after paying $69 fordelivery and an extra $25 for wrapping. The plastic bubble wrapping seemed perfect as the lounge would be stored under a carport for five days then transported for 90 minutes to its new home in the back of a Ute. I arrived from work this afternoon to find the lounge had been delivered completely unwrapped. The delivery guy knew nothing about it (he’s just a contractor) when my mother asked him why it wasn’t wrapped. I phoned IKEA with the given reference number and was on the phone for exactly 30 minutes, on hold for most of this time. The call centre guy spoke with IKEA and said that they could offer a refund and the mistake probably happened because they are very busy. Not good enough. Put on more staff- there are so many people wanting a job. He said someone would call me within the next 48 hours. Unbelievable. Wrapping is part of their policy if the item is not boxed! The docket would show I paid for wrapping. I am on my way home from my second shift and am holding my breath, hoping there is no damage when I check it tomorrow. Moving is stressful enough without this carelessness.",0,1

Till this day I have only received half my order and FedEx just notified me that they have lost my second package and for me to contact you all so you all can file a claim. How can I contact you all when you don’t even answer phone calls nor answer emails. I have emailed your Customer Relations department and issues with them are the same as with your regular customer service department. This is very unprofessional and displays a more serious showing that you all need to focus more on your customer service and response time with the customers that pays your checks. I feel like leading a protest against IKEA and tell everyone to shop Wayfair since they have exceptional customer service along with competitive pricing and they also care about their customers because they realize without the customer they are nothing. You, IKEA on the other hand have gotten too big for your own good and now need a reality check!

I asked why I had an order number had been created if no order had been placed, which he was also unable to advise me on.I asked that since they had caused many problems with my delivery date and the move into my new property, could they change the date of the second order to the original date I was given. They advised that I shouldn't place a second order in case the first one actually goes through. I advised Josh that this won't be an issue as the second order can be refused under the unsolicited goods act or canceled as per the consumer rights act. He wasn’t able to help me with this wish is an appalling display of customer service, since this causes me major issues with my move.I requested that I receive a copy of our chat (which I wasn't given the opportunity to do afterward) which was refused to do. He made a claim with their resolutions team and as per my rights, I requested a copy of this too, which he refused and then proceeded to send me some text that he had typed up but no copy of the claim.

Tried to make a homedelivery with the postal service but they wouldn't.Contacted IKEA again and then they told me since home delivery couldnt be made I should call them.So I called them and explained the situatioin for the third time and got offered a small gift card. Gift card at IKEA wont pay for the time wasted talking to their costumer service, gas for the car, road toll and parking to get the second half of my already delayed package.Usually been happy with IKEA but when you have to jump through hoops and in the end just recieve a useless gift card for something they messed up.",0,2

I have sent emails, requested call backs and joined web- chats all to no avail. The kitchen remains in my garage in boxes unable to be completed until I can resolve this.

There is no way of contacting them via email, phone or live chat, with their chatbot not able to come close to answering my questions. There seems to be a strategy of actively trying to distance themselves from their customers. Whoever came up with this concept (probably as a cost saving) should be fired given all the complaints on this site about their Customer Services.

Fordelaktic hob is brilliant for 6 weeks ( maybe 15 uses ) after that i cant comment. It's expensive at £1150 but the piece of mind of having a 5 year warranty is reduced when you realise it wasn't worth a 5 week one as there's no service agent in UK any more ( was Smeg but ran out on 18th May ) & as for ZERO customer service apart from a request call back form * normally takes a few goes every couple of hours to get a response, businesses shouldn't be able to operate with that level of customer service. wish i'd gone to AO ! who did brilliant job with 4 other appliances. * resolved 02.07.20 Hayley Bellamy in CS came to rescue.",0,5

IKEA,Speechless,"Wow. IKEA customer service was bad before pandemic, but it is nonexistent at this point. Spent nearly $7,000 on a kitchen (in-store purchase in Stoughton, MA). Kitchen installation finally happening (pandemic delays due to social distancing). I need two more cupboard doors and extra toe kick due to plan modification. Soonest delivery by truck was 1+ month out. Bit the bullet and ordered, then canceled immediately and placed partial order (no toe kick) to qualify for parcel delivery, which showed arriving within a week. My card has been charged for both orders. The order that was supposed to arrive on June 1 hasn't even shipped as of June 3. Cannot get a response to cancellation emails. After trying phone customer service for three days, finally reached a human who put me on hold and never came back (waited for a half hour). I love IKEAs products, but I will never buy IKEA again. Shocking that such a large international retailer is so utterly ill-equipped. Even on a good pre-pandemic day IKEA's prehistoric website functionality and ""Where's Waldo?"" customer service make it hard to spend your money at IKEA. Now, they apparently think it's OK to take your money but not actually provide the product. Up next: filing a dispute with Amex and the BBB.",0,1
IKEA,"Worst Experience Ever! If you value your money, do not shop there.","If you don't want to have money taken from you for a month, don't shop there. Ikea borrows your money for a month and returns it to you, with 0% interest, only after you wait hours to talk to them and ask for a refund. Zero respect for customers, absolutely horrendous customer service! I will NEVER shop there again.I placed an order on 29 April 2020 and got an email saying that it would be delivered 3 days later. 2 days later I get an SMS saying ""your order will be delivered tomorrow between 7am and 11am"". The following day at 2pm, nothing had arrived. I get in touch with Ikea through their web chat. They say the order will come. Still nothing.The following day I request a call back, and 30min later a man with an unintelligible accent rings me. He says my order didn't come because one item was not available. (But they couldn't have let me know the day before, of course not! Why let me know if they can make me sit and wait all day like a moron?). He then reschedules my order for the 25th of May - yes, 3 weeks later, and Ikea refunds me for that item 4 days later.On the 20th of May I get an email saying that my order had been cancelled. No explanation, no excuses, nothing. Just - your order has been cancelled. I try to get in touch with them but the buttons for the web chat and call back are inactive. Their website randomly activates these buttons, so you have to keep refreshing every 5 min until you hit lucky. I was finally able to request a call back on the 27th of May. They rang me and - surprise! - I pick up and they stay silent, then hang up on me. Hours later I was able to request another call back, and this time a lady rings me and I am able to explain the problem. She then says I will get my refund within 7 days and they would send me an SMS confirming that the refund had been authorised. I had to check the amount, because they were not refunding the delivery charge!! If I hadn't told them that I wanted the 49 euro back as well, they wouldn't have refunded me for it.So I have two tips:1) If you are thinking of shopping there, think again. We were able to buy everything we wanted from other shops and get everything delivered within 1 week after all this Ikea nonsense. Ikea basically borrowed our money for a month.2) If you have done the same mistake I have and are trying to get in touch with them but having difficulties, I have found a loop hole on their website. Using Safari on a Mac (I don't know whether this works for other browsers), you keep refreshing the contact page until you see the button for a call back activated. After you request a call back, simply hit ""back"" on your browser, and you will go again to the page where you can enter your phone number to request another call back. So no more refreshing-for-hours-like-an-idiot, just ask for another call back if they take more than say 20min to ring -- or if they hang up on you.",0,1

Got an update from IKEA with new delivery notification on May 31 2020. Without any transparency from their side and with close to ZERO possibility of reaching the customer support my intuition says that they don't want to go through their backlog trying to serve current customers first. First of all it would be MUCH better if IKEA charged you only when items are ready to be shipped.

All they had to do is not accept the order 6 weeks ago, instead they took my money for something they didn’t have to sell.",0,1
IKEA,Placed an order April 4th - May 29th still waiting for order to be processed!!,"Placed an order April 4th - showed waiting to be picked. After two weeks with no change in status - couldn't reach. I call and call some days told that the phones were down because of service issues.....sometimes don't even get to that stage. Told to use chat - what chat - no such thing on their website. Called numerous times every day finally one day after repeat calling and on hold for over an hour I talked to a person. Promised my order would arrive no later than yesterday - May 28th. Here it is the 29th and still showing order is processing and cannot reach IKEA. Stores with a lot less money are offering far more superior customer service. What a terrible experience dealing with this customer. Finally today asked PayPal to refund my money - IKEA has until June 18th to respond. I am so glad these people are not in charge of disaster services!! I suggest you contact Fossil or many, many other suppliers to find out how to provide customer service.",0,1

IKEA,I bought online some garden furniture…,"I bought online some garden furniture in Ikea. They didn't have all I wanted available for home delivery when you're shopping online. To get all I wanted to be delivered to my home I'd have to go to the store in Dublin and pay in there for the stuff. I leave in Cork though. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's true. I bought what was available online in Ireland and next day I went to Ikea Poland webside and bought another part (approx half of what I initially wanted) online in there. The parcel from Poland was sent to my polish home address, then picked up by national couriers and sent to international couriers depot and finally send to my home address in Ireland.I got it yesterday.I'm still waiting for the part bought in Ireland and it was supposed to be here 2 days ago. Unable to contact them as due to Covid19 all phone numbers are switched off.The is an option of contacting online but when I go there it says that it's not available at the moment and asking to contact Mon-Fri between 9am and 5.30 pm.It's 3pm on Thursday I'm writing this and I tried to contact them approx 30 minutes ago.I will rather make a furniture out of wooden pallets than ever buy anything from Ikea Ireland again.Happy customer.

IKEA,The experience itself is as low quality as the goods they sell.,"I placed my order with Ikea on 4/18/20 understanding that COVID-19 has vastly effect e-commerce. To be honest, I'd be fine with the delay if I didn't notice other retailers basically continuing business as usual. I ordered from another retailer and after reaching out they told me that delays in France where manufacturing has been halted was the reason for the delay which I fully understand. Ikea has closed down all of its communication with customers. I understand furloughing people, but I am certain this kind of work can be done from home -- responding to customers over email. Or better yet, a single mass email to all open orders explaining the situation. Instead, I waited 6 weeks before I got an update -- that my order had shipped. However, it's been 5 days since that email, and FedEx's portal says the label has been created but not sent out... WHY?!? Post memorial day, it should be shipped by now (Wednesday). All routes on the phone (1,2,3, etc) lead to being disconnected, the only kind of response you can submit online is to cancel your order, and that's been the experience thus far. All I ordered were some aluminum shelving for my cabinets and a pack of tea towels... I didn't even order large furniture. If I didn't already have some of those shelves I'd replace them with the container store which although delayed got my order to me in 4 weeks. This is the last time I'm ever buying anything from Ikea because it clearly isn't supporting jobs and the experience itself is as low quality as the goods they sell.",0,1

IKEA,IKEA has NO Customer Service. Beyond Frustrated!,"More then once now, I have tried to order a couple of items from the IKEA website. After I get all the way to the payment It finally tells me I can't order because they don't have any available and tell me to ""try Again Later"". Why don't tell me it was not available when I was looking at the item like other stores do? Why can't it just place my order ""on back order""? why do I have to try again_ waste my time_ instead of them filling my order when available? -- Not efficient. Not convenient. OK a week later I tried again. It had my items available. I placed the order. I was excited to finally finish my home office.... Well....hold your excitement!!~!! Because 1 week before I was to received my items -- it was canceled. ""It simply canceled the order period. no explanation,. was not available"" . Here is you money back and try again later!!! AGAIN! here goes more of my time--- Not Convenient!!! Also the other items were delayed 10 days!!! Now, I learned that I can order and pick it up at the local store in Colorado. I was all excited. I read I could order, pay and it would schedule a pick up for me. I can see they have my item but again only when i get to the payment part of the process it is telling me that the ""Location I need.... exceeded the amount of orders"" TRY TOMORROW. What is wrong with these people??? Why can't you just fill my order and let me know when it is available to pick up??? like it said it would?? why is this so inconvenient??? So I called.... and I get a machine who tells me ""Sorry but we are overwhelmed and can't take you call!"" Is this for real????My understanding is that IKEA is an European store and I can't believe that Europeans would put up with this bad of a service. Please fix it. There are plenty of e commerce websites who do a fantastic job at websites and delivery. Ordering through the internet is not a ""new thing"".

Even at 4:30 this morning when I tried to make the order just incase. Apparently ikea doesn't have a phone number for the store either. What a terrible experience.

We have been called back that day and the very helpful assistent let us know that actually the curtains were not on stock in your warehouse?!

We have reached out yesterday again, waited 1 hour in the phone queu, when finally the assistent told us that the Missing part of the order have been shipped but we were only going to get a number today ( working with a webshop I am aware, that at the moment of preparing and dispatching the package, a waybill number is generates, so I assume the package has not been sent...) Today we were still patient ( now it has been almost a month since we have ordered) but no sign of any tracking number or confirmation of shipping. We wrote everything down in their customer service chat telling all we got was false promises and what we got there in return was a general promise again.. finally after we've been sturdy, they asked for our bank account to refund the cost of the Collection, THE CHAT CLOSED DOWN!!!

The last email I received was on April 16th and they took full payment on that day, unlike other retailers that do not charge until your order ships. When I tried to call customer service to get a status on the delivery, I was not able to reach a human being, although I did spend a lot of time going round and round with an automated call menu. Worse yet, the only option they have for contact us on their site gives me only one drop down selection - ""Order Cancellation"", but the form that should show text fields for me to populate order number and other info does not populate. I tried tweeting. No answer. I tried Facebook Messenger. No response. So here I sit... products and customer service both missing in action.

How is this legal and how is this allowed in the United States. This company is sheltering millions of dollars on the shoulders of its customers just to whether its own economic storm. I have called this company 25 times in the past three weeks, and have never gotten a live representative. This has nothing to do with call volume, otherwise the odds of one person getting through over dozens of calls would be at the least possible. In fact, this company has no interest in talking to customers. I was a two-decade consumer of this company, but no more.

Ikea sent an email saying my item was on its way, the delivery company said they had no knowledge of my delivery. Ikea have no way of being contacted, no email, no online chat and certainly no number. So I have paid for my item, waited more than three weeks and now for all I know I may never receive my item and never be able to contact Ikea. So what do I have to do? Hire a solicitor and Take them to a small claims court to get my money back? No one has time for that. I feel that many companies are using the Covid 19 pandemic as an excuse for bad service.

IKEA is clearly just letting all its customers down from what I'm seeing. I mean first off, maybe you need to give customers a heads up when they order that they will be waiting 6+ weeks for delivery and maybe don't charge customers until you actually fill the order. IKEA's customer service right now, is NON-EXISTANT. Chat always full- can't even get in the queue and the call centre just disconnects you after you've been waiting.

Terrible and dangerous! But that's not all. After countless promises for call-backs and warehouse searches, no one ever followed up. Finally I was able to get a supervisor, who offered to refund the delivery fee and the part of the couch that wasn't delivered. Like that was making it right... I was told I could order it once it came back into stock. So I did (after getting the refund 3 weeks later). I ordered the couch, which said it would be delivered in a week. Four days later, after I called to double-check, they said my order was cancelled (no email/update online). Why? Because Ikea didn't receive my payment. Even though my bank account showed that had been pulled (the full delivery and all). After checking with a manager, they found out my CC was charged and that it was cancelled due to a ""technical glitch"". Kicker is, the couch is now out of stock! So I'll get a refund in 3 weeks and still half a couch! I will never ever shop at Ikea again. There is no sense of customer service at this company and their order system clearly doesn't work. Ikea never offered to make it right and none of the representatives/managers ever offered to make the situation right or follow up",0,1
IKEA,No delivery,"I ordered tables from Ikea on 29 March which was supposed to be delivered on 6 April.The order never came, got contacted by elite to give my shipping address and after that nothing, Ikea's only response to any kind of mail is ""we will get back to you in 72 hours"". Nobody response if you call them. Their Facebook page if full of angry customers, some have received who had ordered two week after us order, but most have not received their order. If they could just reply and give us a timeline of delivery date, we can make a decision to cancel or keep the order, but no response.I always hope that tomorrow it will arrive, but now it has been 1.5 months waiting and still nothing.",0,1

No delivery details/status provided, I cancelled the order given the lack of delivery details and as one of the items was urgently needed at that stage. Cancellation confirmation received without an issue. However, no refund of the amount which had been charged to my card 4-5 weeks prior. Requested a call back, and was provided with a case number and additional phone number to call. Called and was very abruptly advised 'it will be handled', the 'customer service' rep then hung up. One week later, no refund or update so I called again to be advised my case number is invalid... I'm now waiting on a new case number and told I'll be advised via email on 13MAY20. I'm not hopeful of getting the refund of 300euro+ any time soon. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE FROM IKEA - order elsewhere or wait until the stores reopen and you have your goods in-hand.Update 14MAY20 - promise of an email and next steps on the refund was yet another empty promise. Called yet again, to be given another run around - no record of ANY previous calls/emails. Ridiculous company.",0,1

IKEA,Cancelled an order without telling me and offered a ridiculous new delivery date.,"While I would not call going into the store to make purchases a bad experience, ordering from them online is not a good option. I have had 3 online delivery orders with them and one for in-store pick up. They deliver things open and unprotected, which the delivery people have even called crazy. The in-store pickup has some policies that are not consumer friendly. The main reason I'm writing this though is the 3rd online order from them, which will be my last. I ordered from them on April 11th for a May 11th delivery date. one item was out of stock, which they notified me about on May 8th. What they did not say is they canceled the order as a result and created a new one without a delivery date. The order was not showing up on the website so I called them. They offered a delivery on June 28th. I declined and they said they would have the refund to me in about 10 days (most place do a 2-3 maximum). Every other company I have worked with makes a point to make things right quickly. Offering a delivery over 6 weeks later after you have already waited 4 weeks is by no means reasonable, at least to me and my experience in customer service.",0,1
IKEA,Ikea bunch of Liars,"Ordered items, paid extortionate delivery cost and chose date of delivery. As all the reviews, my delivery also did not show up. As all Ikea phone lines are closed, i had to wait on a chat portal, which in total wasted nearly 6 hours of my time. 1st individual i spoke to Muhammed.Hadn't a clue what day of the week it was. Asked when my parcel would arrive, he left the conversation. Waited again to speak to someone. This time it was someone called Katie.She advised it should be delivered and gave me a telephone number to call. I called the number whilst chatting to her, and the recorded message stated we are unable to support you through this channel. Basically meaning the phone lines are closed, which is what it states on their website. When i advised Katie of this, she stated, the phone line is open and it stops taking calls because too many people are in the queue. What a lie. When pushed for confirmation of delivery and the complaints process and details, again she also ended the chat and left.Finally spoke to 3rd joker called Janet. Who again could not give a straight answer when i asked if she could provide me with the tracking number of my order. I stated, the ikea online tracker is inaccurate. She stated DPD are having tech issues, therefore their info is not coming through to ikea and they do not have any details. But she was able to confirm, the item is loaded on the truck and assured me if an item is loaded then this means it will be delivered on the day. I spoke to DPD, who can search if they have an item for you by name and address, confirmed they have no delivery or tech issues. You've guessed it, No Delivery and no apology or call or email to advise of delays from ikea. If you can't operate during this lockdown, then stop trading. Letting so many people down who are keeping themselves occupied by renovating/decorating their home and using ikea the Not So Wonderful Everyday! to do this. I have emailed their complaints team but no response. Even that on their website is hidden really well, you have to search like a mi6 agent to get those details. But here it is if anyone needs it: ikea.complaints.gb @ikea.comDon't bother ordering online. Even though they are rumoured to be opening soon, just spend your money elsewhere.",0,1

IKEA,Totally Crap Delivery System and Service,"Totally crap service! Three weeks ago I ordered a bed frame. It was supposed to arrive 5th May but didn't turn up. I called up to see what had happened and turns out the number was wrong on the order so the delivery company had called and because no one had answered, they just didn't turn up. Okay maybe fair enough, so I asked them to update the phone number on the order to my number and rescheduled the delivery for 8th May. Due to some system error, the delivery company didn't get the message, so again it didn't turn up. I then spoke to another person and arranged delivery directly with the delivery service for 11/05. I didn't get a call with a four hour window the day before so I call up today and turns out they called the wrong number AGAIN and cancelled the delivery because no one answered. Now the IKEA number to reschedule the order isn't working. Totally pathetic! Very frustrated an will definitely not be recommending to a friend.",0,1

Decided an hour later to cancel that order & add more similar items. New delivery date was 15th May! Serious problems getting refund for first order. Few days ago my second order was cancelled by Ikea without any reason. Will probably have same problem with refund. How are they getting away with taking payment immediately, giving delivery date weeks ahead & then cancelling order & holding refund for as long as they can. Absolutely disgraceful that they can do this. Something needs to be done since you can’t contact anyone at Ikea at any time. Never again will I buy anything from Ikea.",0,1

I decide to call and I was waiting for over 45 min before getting a hold of an agent, agent told me AGAIN she will need to transfer me but unfortunately now the agents are off I asked for a call back she said NO I WILL HAVE to call back and wait again if I wanna cancel my order.

IKEA,"Shady practices, borderline Ponzi scheme","Placed my pick up order a month ago, paid for it right away. It was never delivered to the pick up locations, customer service is so overwhelmed it's impossible to even get in line.That would probably be okay, but they now offer new pick up options, which means taking lots and lots of new orders, but what about the backlog? Read their instagram, there are people waiting for 8-10 weeks. All those money are in IKEA's hands now, and yet they accept new orders. This isn't just unethical, this is criminal. No one should be allowed to collect money for goods/services they don't intend to deliver.I understand the pandemic is affecting retailers all over the world, but every single retailer (from amazon to small local businesses) I dealt with in the past two months has been able to deliver the goods, albeit later than usual.

IKEA,Shocking service recovery,"My girlfriend made an online order for us. She drove out to the IKEA Taastrup where we ordered from and was told our order had been cancelled, recreated and cancelled again (I suspect a member of staff didn't fancy picking so many items) my partner asked how this was possible as the only information she had received was an order confirmation and instructions for us to go and collect our order.She came home empty handed. After chatting to web chat she was instructed to call customer services. Customer services told her after a lengthy call that they had agreed for our order to be picked with the store and we could collect it after the next day. We have a newborn baby and were in the middle of moving so our time is limited and we were counting quite heavily on getting the curtains from our order to help put the baby down to sleep in the dark.We also specifically chose online picking to avoid crowds (due to the virus) and to save time.Next it was my turn. I drove again to IKEA early on Sunday morning to collect our order and made sure I arrived early enough (09:40) to be the 2nd car waiting outside the collection point. IKEA staff came strolling out of the building around 10:15 and began dealing with the first car at least 20 mins after the supposed opening time. When it was my turn I was asked to wait in bay 1. I did so and after 10 minutes I was told very quickly through my car window that I needed to go to the returns section of the store to collect my order, and they had nothing to do with it (even though 10 minutes earlier they took the code customer services gave to my gf for our newly recreated order). At this point I was beginning to get very frustrated, it was weekend and the number of cars in the parking lot indicated there would be a lengthy queue.The returns section was cordoned off due to the virus and I could see that only 1 or 2 people were being allowed down into the returns section at a time. I explained to the member of staff on the door my situation. This was the only member of staff of the 10 that I, or my partner dealt with who showed any real empathy to my story and situation. He let me go down, avoiding a queue that looked like it would take at least 45 minutes to get through.Downstairs I spent 30-40 minutes with an angry, uninformative member of staff who made phone call after phone call. Always out of hearing distance for me and who told me multiple times ""it's busy""""you will have to pick your order yourself"" ""I don't know where your order is"". It was quite clear once I was asked to leave the collection point that my order had never been picked.When you pay for a service you expect it to be delivered and if not at least a satisfactory answer to why what should be a standard business practice of order picking could go so wrong. If you're staff had any proper training then a simple apology, explanation of the error and some form of compensation would have kept me a happy customer. Instead her and others lack of empathy and desire to take responsibility to do this only fuelled my frustration more. I can see now that I am not the only one who has received such a shocking level of service so it is clear IKEAs promise to pick and deliver orders for such a low fee clearly backfired and fatigue set in for staff.In the end I got a refund for the exact amount of our order, so I could go and pick my order myself and a measly 300 kr compensation for 2 wasted car trips and approx 8 hours of our time split over multiple days wasted not being able to collect the order as intended.Terrible service execution and even worse service recovery.",0,1

What is the sense in that? I checked the item online on the day I received the email about the delayed delivery and the item was actually available for delivery in my postcode. Yet, when I called their customer service, I was told that whoever was responsible for organising my items for delivery could not find the plant pot even if it says that it is available online.

Even with picture proof, they still insist on picking it up to verify the damage for themselves. In a normal world that fine, but during COVID they should make changes to their procedures to honor their own terms and conditions with the customer. They put the onus on the customer to keep the broken furniture until IKEA feels its okay to pick it up. They don't really care about following their own rules; their customer service agents just makeup stuff and try to placate you with tiny discounts. Do you want your full refund? I hope your able to play the long game.",0,1

Everything is ready to go, we just aren't allowed to buy.- Call them up next day, wait in line for over 50 minutes (all the while being told it's almost your turn and they value your time...). - Told that we have book another design your wardrobe meeting, you generally have to book well in advance to get one of these. - In next meeting, we're told that you have to book with your local advisor, otherwise they cannot send you your wares. We have to book yet another meeting. - We are now told they can't deliver for 12 days and some of the wares won't be available until 5 days from now. Unfortunately these won't be part of the order. Lots of confusion as to how many people we should be to receive the wares, since they apparently wont deliver into your apartment and which warehouses will have then missing pieces stocked at what time.I strongly encourage everyone to pay a little extra, so you avoid spending weeks getting your actual wares, several trips to the physical store, and not the least - get nicer looking furniture.",0,1

Long story short, I bought a mattress in 2015 with 25 year warranty, and when the bed started falling apart during regular use, they will not respond to my request for warranty claim. I have tried since 2018 and in 2020 had to just get a new mattress from someone else. I have proof that some of my attempts to contact them through the channel they recommended (using the online contact form) did reach them, as I have the ""No reply"" confirmation email telling me that they will get back to me. They never ever did get back to me. Their tactic with warranty claims seems to be to ignore until the customer goes away. I find it disgusting that they would bait customers with long warranties (25 years is the longest I've heard of for mattresses) and then just completely ignore their warranty duties. Anyone else having this issue with IKEA? If there are enough of us suffering this, perhaps we can get a class action suit against IKEA.",0,1

IKEA,Diabolical service,"Our bad experience with Ikea started pre coronavirus when they sent us the wrong item we had ordered online. We arranged for it to be collected and the right one delivered, however on the morning the delivery was due we had a phone call cancelling it due to the coronavirus measures. When I checked online it said they were still delivering and indeed they were tweeting people to say they were still fulfilling orders - clearly not the case! When I finally managed to get hold of someone they said my item had been cancelled because it wasn’t an online order. Of course it was an online order as I’d ordered it from the website, however apparently exchanges need to be done via a store. So even though it was their mistake in the first place they were unable to assist and said that the only option would be to wait until lockdown was over and they could deliver the correct item. This wasn’t acceptable to me, I needed the item for a nursery, there was no good them exchanging in a couple of months time when the baby is already here, meanwhile having space taken ho with the incorrect item.After a lot of arguing they agreed they would refund me the difference between the two items and I could just keep the original incorrect item. This wasn’t great as I’d already paid the extortionate £40 for delivery of the wrong item, but it seemed like that was the best we would get. Of course surprise surprise the money has never actually materialised. I was assured it would be refunded within two weeks. After three weeks I got in touch again and got told it was stuck in a queue but would be processed in 3-5 days. Fast forward another week, still no money. Get in touch again and told it would be another 3-5 days. Surprise surprise 3-5 days later and still no money!!! They have now messaged me on Twitter asking me to ring them so they can manually process the refund - god knows how long it will take to get through and again I probably still won’t actually receive the money. I appreciate companies are under pressure with coronavirus but it is still not acceptable to just keep hold of someone’s money when you are not able to deliver them the goods. Ironically I could quite easily order the correct item online and pay another £40 for delivery, yet they won’t deliver the correct item to me as they say they can’t currently collect the incorrect one.

This analyst cancelled my order without my permission and I received an email with a credit invoice that I will now not get for 10+ working days. I am livid. I waited 1 full month for my order for it to not arrive on the set date and then for it to be cancelled without my permission. Had to wait another 20 minutes to talk to another analyst to try revoke this cancellation to be told that they can do this but the 3 main items I ordered were now out of stock and delivery will not be until mid June for the other items so I had to keep my refund as the order was pointless.

We did this, but every time we submitted our order the system would say 'This item is not available'. We deleted the item and tried again, BUT another item is now no longer available. I stubbornly continued until there was literally NOTHING available. Tried calling, but that doesn't do anything. Tried emailing, but you can't.. This story could and should be much MUUUCH longer, but to keep it short- DON'T SHOP HERE!.. I'm also a contractor with 3 kitchen and 2 bath remodels scheduled for the summer and we will definitely not be going with IKEA. And because I'm so unbelievably annoyed (and stubborn) with his company, I'll be sure to inform all my friends to do the same... This is now my life mission.",0,1
IKEA,disgusting after sales,I will never go near this company again. I ordered from them around the beginning of April and cancelled a few hours later. They sent me an online report saying I would get a refund. Instead they asked me to claim a gift voucher for the same price. How dare they! This was never mentioned as an option in their cancellation policy. I can’t make contact at all. I’m so angry! What a dreadful company they are.,0,1
IKEA,IKEA is the worst customer service…,"IKEA is the worst customer service company ever. After more than a month I am still expecting my refund, my own money, based on their mistake. The delivery process is unbelievable. They send you an email with the estimate day and when I called to confirm, the same day, they told me that I will receive another email in 7-10 days. Now I’m without sink in my bathroom for more than a week. And for apologize they offered me $20 gift card after I spent $700. The worst, I will never recommend this brand to anyone",0,1

IKEA,IKEA - Feels Like a Scam,"LONG STORY SHORT: IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and ""respectable"" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam. DETAILS:This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the ""Picking"" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks. So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was ""currently unavailable"". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available. I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the ""queue"" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take ""7-12 business days"" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either. In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to ""user inactivity"". So now I'm back at square one. Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour. I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an ""email"" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful. Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy?At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation.",0,1
IKEA,Never again,"I ordered some items almost 2 weeks ago and scheduled the delivery for the 11th of April. Of course the order didn't arrive so 1 hour before the deadline I opened a chat. I never ever experienced such a bad customer service. Odienne (the first agent I talked to) wasn't able to provide me a solution, moreover she made be late at work and I got deducted for that. She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job. I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.I would attach the screenshots of the chats to show everybody what 'great' customer service means. This will follow up with a complaint at the complaints book so that the authorities are aware of how the customers are getting screwed up and stolen by these kind of companies.",0,1
IKEA,"Late delivery, lost goods","I made an order on the site on the 16th of March, the delivery was scheduled for the 24th of March. They called me on the 21st of March to say that a part of the delivery will arrive on the 7th of April. Another part arrived on the 2nd of April instead of the 24th of March and there wasn't one of two pillows there.I filled the form on their site to report the missed position on the same day but since then nobody has contacted me.COVID-19 is a good cover for bad service, right guys?",0,1
IKEA,If I could give zero stars I would.,If I could give zero stars I would.I placed an order for a loft bed and mattress almost a month ago. On the first of delivery attempt the drivers gave me one box out of the three items that I ordered. Two boxes that belong to an us another customer and was told that I was supposed to get three boxes here is three boxes if they’re not correct we can’t take them back you have to call customer service. That was three weeks ago I have had another customers order sitting in my house for three weeks my daughter who is five years old has been without a bed for three weeks waiting on this to be delivered. I am now being told that to the mattress that I had ordered and paid for is now out of stock which it wasn’t when I ordered it. The delivery company keeps trying to deliver the frame itself or to pick up the other customers order no attempts to get my order correct have been made. IKEAs customer service has been incredibly awful to say the least. They seem to be more prone to just throw money at the situation instead of trying to fix it. I don’t need money thrown out the situation I need my order I’m at the point where I’m going to just cancel my order in order with somebody else. If you have the option to order with anybody other than IKEA do it worst experience ever will not be shopping with them again,0,1

The least they can do is to communicate by email. I see ikea is giving away free furniture to needy families. Doing one publicity stunt is not going to make up for neglecting paying customers.,0,1

Support hung up in the middle of conversation and support manager not responding to follow up email. They said there is nothing they can do and to wait another 2 weeks for delivery. Offered no alternative or compensation. Probably the worst shopping experience I have ever had. Another week goes by, support not responding on follow up email. No communication.

IKEA,Chaotic online experience.,(Reviewing Ikea UK) Chaotic online experience. Order placed several weeks ago with a long delivery lead time.

A couple of days later it arrived. Fortunately I hadn't got round to ordering from elsewhere.,0,3

Not next day or the day after.There was email option only for IKEA business customer so I called IKEA customer service, only to be told ""there are usual number of calls and we cannot take your call"" and a hang up x four consecutive days.I finally managed to find a page to request refund. I gave them reason for seeking refund and submitted this form. No confirmation of receipt of this request.What kind of business are they running? Do they not care about their customers? Their reputation? Are they so well off they don't need business from little guys? If there's no one working, how about telling us that they plan to halt operation so we don't waste an entire week waiting for that doorbell? It really doesn't take that much effort.",0,1

IKEA,Expensive delivery in times of  COVID-19 a bust! Don't bother.,"So disappointed with their COVID-19 delivery service response. I placed an online order 17 days ago. The day I placed my order I received a message saying my order was being handpicked. Then nothing..... When I contacted Ikea today 17 days later, all I get is 'sorry, fed-ex is behind'. I can understand that, but what I do not comprehend is how I can be told Ikea has no idea when it will be delivered. April, May, June? My order is still with the store. Ikea's shipping fees are some of the highest in the industry, yet there is no accountability for giving me any information as to an estimated delivery date on their part. Ikea you need to negotiate a better delivery contract. You need to lower your delivery fees, especially in an age when Amazon does much faster and for free. You need to up your game if you wish to stay in the long run. And, you need to better equip your employees with information so that they can communicate effectively with the customer.",0,1

Eventually I chatted to them and found out that they only deliver items under 25kg. I then tried to cancel the items above 25kg. This wouldn't be possible. I had to cancel the entire order worth well over £4,000. I was then told that I should simply call the refund department to speed up the refund. Customer Services are closed! Excuse me?

IKEA,You know those bad reviews that you wonder if they can't be all true... ha haha hahahaha *cries*,"I have never had a bad enough experience that I've had to share with my entire circle of family and friends just how bad a company can be and to avoid them. I order a sofa the FRIHETEN. I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes. I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for ""choosing the wrong date"" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA ""we never got the couch from you"". A slightly different story. I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the ""final stages"" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.I asked IKEA if they would offer anything to maybe convince me to buy the couch (small discount at least) and prove that they aren't all bad.

IKEA,Ikea's leadership strategy,"With the news about the furniture lawsuit in the papers about faulty dressers, it may be helpful to revive Ikea's value. Mistakes happen, and its how a company reacts to make the change. --Ikea is focusing on the value its products bring to their consumers, not with just an affordable pricing structure. They've precisely pinpointed their cost structure in the sweet-spots of wallets. And to supplement that pricing, they give consumers a community to belong to with their open floorplans and a unique buying experience. It almost gives me a vision as to what a success story looks like, with seeing open housing concepts and being able to capture my own independence when I buy a home or condo, and begin to liven it up; just by walking around. Ikea supplies just that right amount of ""gunpowder"" to make an idea explode into action. Cheap, but not discount store quality. What other furnishing company can pull that off?",0,4

They keep you waiting for more then 3 hours due to their complete incompetence as how they say: they have no personnel who speaks English.., so instead of informing people like me about that, they keep letting other people to design their own kitchen while (English speakers, wait in the IKEA like morons). More disturbing part was, that I was speaking with them in English and they have replied without any problem. While people were waiting to be served, personnel were having fun, fooling around, laughing, joking and acting totally unprofessional and inadequate. On top of that, when you request to speak with whoever is in charge at that department, some of their personnel are completely dishonest saying that they mentioned that this takes more then two hours, while to me they claimed it is ""up to 2 hours"" (huge difference)... To IKEA folk: Do you really think that wasting 3.5 hours of customers time is a normal thing..., shifting our plans and agendas, while in parallel you don't even consider that it is important to inform people prior,t you have issues with your own personnel/man power, and/or that you cannot serve English speaking folk?

IKEA,Avoid this toxic company who hold their customers in contempt,"IKEA Manchester overcharged us by £21.00. I only discovered this once we got home. I called customer service and was told we'd have to return to the store within 14 days to get a refund and that they'd have to check the CCTV. This was not welcome news as it meant a 1-hour round trip on a work evening which was highly inconvenient. I couldn't believe that they didn't have a better and more sophisticated system in place than looking on CCTV. Despite the frustration, we turned up to the store yesterday evening only to be told that they didn't gave any staff available to check the CCTV so couldn't issue a refund! I was furious and demanded to see the manager. The manager was devoid of any charm or pleasantness and told me it was their policy to check cctv first and that I wouldn't get a refund until the next day. We were given a case number and told we woukd receive a call once the refund was done. I made my frustration known and said I intended to complain. The manager looked totally unconcerned, and reading comments here I can see why. They basically couldn't care less because no one's going to do anything or take any action. I checked their website for their complaints procedure and there isn't even a complaints category included as far as I could see. Again, another clear signal of just how little they care about their customers. After searching via Google I found an email address for Javier Quinones at IKEA and emailed about my situation. Not even an automated response came back telling me how long before I'd receive a reply. By 2.40 pm today, no one had called back so I contacted customer service again. After almost 40 minutes on the phone of stalling and being put on hold for ages several times, I put my foot down and finally got to speak to the manager. I was told he'd contact the store to get them to resolve it but there were all sorts of excuses given for their useless response. I told him I expected the refund to be sorted within the next hour as it was their error and I'd spent so long trying to get this resolved. I tweeted about their useless service on IKEA Support and got a quick public response asking me to DM them. I did this but they did nothing in response except give me another pointless reason for why they couldn't sort it out. So, merely a face-saving exercise in public, which is sheer hypocrisy. We are still awaiting the refund so the only route for us now is via our credit card company. I see that IKEA don't bother to respond to any of the many complaints on here which again just shows their contempt for their customers. With all their millions of profit, they still refuse to give us our £21 back that they took in error. It beggars belief. Truly, I never want to deal with this vile organisation again. It's a toxic company staffed by management who couldn't care less. Avoid at all costs if you want to keep your sanity and money.",0,1

Aventually after 2 days 2 „ experts” came to me... their cross my door step and look at the unfolded bed and said..” is it from ikea”??? , w.t.f ... no, from media markt... yes i said its ikea, vimle, kind of popular model... the „experts” first time have seen a bed from ikea... i had to show them how to open it, how to close it, their was looking on manual 20 minutes, their was touching the joints like it was a rocket science.. finally their said „ we dont know why its like this” one said , that i can put 2 books under this hanging in the air legs...! WT£I said no! Lisa said, you are comming here, and u bring a new bed and new back rest , where is it? ...yyy, „we dont know nothing about it..” we dont have it.. i immediatly called ikea, i was on the phone 20 minutes and the girl couldnt do anything, she said basicly, its ikea Breda, you have to contact them, i can only arrange exchange for next week!i said NO, i ve been told by Lisa, their will brong me pieces TODAY, as im waiting to use this couche since ive paid for it 1.200e already 9 days to be able to sleep on it or use it, i want this today! Noone couldnt do anything, i was left with this rommel alone... writing to ikea on messenger, was like .. one operator asking again for my order number, then another operator also ask me to fill some form, then another one is totally not aware of nothing. I wasted tons of my time, energy, nerves for nothing. Then their said the „ experts said their couldnt judge the problrm cause the couche was not fully assembly by me! It does not matter! The bed mechanism works the same when is assembled or not, the danage on ecoleather wont heal itself when I MEAN W.TF PEOPLE, is it some joke? Ikea sell you SH! T and wash hands, noone can help u, noone can do anything. U just left with a bunch of „collegues” who just reflecting the problem one to the other making a jerk out of you. And noone is responsible. Their lie to u, their misslead You like Lisa did to me. And thats it. You waist your 2 weeks of your precious time for this . I paid 1.200e for the couche, im ashamed i didnt go to any other shop, could buy much better couche, much better design,much higher quality, and for product for 1.200e some help if needed or some respect. Also the back rest pillows of the couch has a huge diference in hardness... one pillow is around 1.5x thicker/harder / more dens, than 2 others which makes it not comfortable thete where is a “hard” pillow. Judge yourself if u wanna go tru all this problems.",0,1
IKEA,"Delivery Never Showed, Ikea wants $50 more to deliver items","Bought $400 of stuff online. I’m sure it would have been great stuff, but we never received it. My husband and I were both home anxiously waiting the day it was supposed to be delivered. Nobody ever knocked. The whole day passes by. Still no ikea. I get an email from IKEA saying they want us to pay $50 more to deliver it. Why are they charging me twice for a service they never provided? I called ikea support, and they said that apparently nobody will come to deliver the items unless you answer a call from an unknown number a couple hours beforehand. I never answer calls from unknown numbers. It should be illegal to charge people for services you did not provide. I will not be paying for redelivery, and ikea is refusing to refund the $50 I already paid for delivery. Unfortunately, I paid with a debit card, so there is no way to dispute the transaction. We will never purchase from ikea again.",0,1

IKEA,Pricey but overall good products,"I have two rooms full of Ikea products and so far I am pleased with them. Indeed they are pricey sometimes, but you can wait for the sales or at least choose only small furniture like desks, tables, beds etc. if you don’t want to pay too much. You have to be careful with the furniture as it can easily get scratched and of course because it’s made of wood splinters you can’t expect it to last for 10 years. But who knows if you take really good care of it, maybe you’ll be surprised. So far I am happy with my products and I didn’t have any bad experiences with them. I usually go there and buy them myself, but when I bought the bed, mattress and wardrobe I had to choose for them to be delivered. The guys were really nice and the furniture was in perfect condition. (I also have mirrors on the wardrobe and they came intact)",0,5

IKEA,We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a…,"We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a mirror weeks ago and opted for home delivery. On the day it was meant to arrive, the delivery was towards the end of the window they gave us (we received no notice until they were almost at our door and thought they had missed our order). Some items were delivered damaged, including a smashed mirror and a broken PAX frame. The frame was ""dented"" in the sense that the laminate tore and the inside looked completely hollow. The delivery guy said our items were at the bottom of the truck, so that combined with it being late implied we were the last delivery of the day. They made a note of the damaged items and told us to wait for a call from IKEA. (A somewhat odd note was they refused to take the smashed mirror back, and just propped it against a wall by the kitchen, even though we had a cat who could get himself hurt with the exposed pieces.)The call never came and several days later we decided to call IKEA ourselves. They don't tell you the wait-time would take hours. The agent told us they were low on stock and would have to call us back on Wednesday (which is a week later). That call never came either, and on Thursday we called IKEA again, got put on hold for hours, only to be told by the agent that our case needs to be transferred to the after-sales department, which is unavailable currently due to ""high call volumes"". We called once again on Friday, got put on hold again, got told by an agent again that he'd need to transfer us to the after-sales department, to which by the way there's no direct line, so you have to remain connected through two transfers and two queues or else your enquiries won't even reach a human being.So after waiting another several hours and 29 other callers ahead of us, we got hold of an agent who, to add insult to injury, tried to offer us 20% discount to keep the broken wardrobe. When we told him no, he said he'd put through a replacement delivery scheduled next Sunday for 1-5pm.Sunday 5pm passed as well, and on our final call to IKEA we were told the replacement order was never even processed by the system. The after-sales agent implied it took two days to process an order in their esoteric system, and they didn't even offer a way to notify us in the event of an order-processing failure, or somehow guarantee a delivery after everything.We're left to wait another few days with now little confidence the delivery will ever actually arrive.At this point I'm at a loss for words.",0,1

This delay cost the builder three days of lost work, for which he invoiced me £600.I told IKEA this and they invited me to send them his invoice indicating that they do offer reimbursements. But while they accepted the legitimacy of the builder's company, his tax status, and of the claim, they refused to pay the invoice on the grounds that his company is not VAT registered - a factor which is of course irrelevant to the claim. It is of course perfectly legitimate for a company not to be VAT registered, but IKEA tell me it is against their own regulations.So I am left with a bill for £600 from my builder for lost time through no fault of my own, which IKEA refuses to refund on a technicality of their own invention (nothing to do with UK consumer law) which I cannot get around.",0,1

IKEA customer service kept me holding and arguing with them for 4 hours 6:00pm till 10:00pm and be faced with these scammers on the counter that didn't want to return the sofa. why? because they said its used and i don't have the original packaging stating that they only take it if it is with the packaging to ""PUT BACK ON SHELF & SELL IT TO OTHER PEOLE"". Customer service on the phone says something which is not inline with the store customer service. IKEA staff has misunderstanding between them, this shouldn't be reflected on the customers.3 issues here:1. customer service on the phone says one thing, Customer service in store says another and argue with you and their manager just disappears for not wanting to Meet the customer, which she was employed to deal with.2. IKEA wants to put the furniture back on the shelf?? really?? then did i buy a used sofa before and paid the full price of it? are they selling used furniture with the price of a new one?3. 365 days return policy!! hahahahahahahha tell this to someone that has no common sense. there will always be something that you will pull off not to return.If anyone has a sense of mind, don't go to IKEA to buy anything. they will only make you lose your money and its value.",0,1

The back board wasn’t much stronger than cardboard and the rest was very poor quality. When i phoned I got a very rude customer service manager who basically told us we had built it wrong. Not sure how she could know that with no evidence at all. I then spoke to someone else over email who looked at pictures and said we had built it wrong. He said this is a very common problem with this wardrobe and therefore he knew we had built it wrong. Problem: if this is a regular problem perhaps maybe there is an issue with this wardrobe?? however they refuse to give us a refund! I will never buy another thing from IKEA. I am absolutely disgusted! My problem with this is that IKEA are a massive corporation and I am me! Customers should not feel like this. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.,0,1

IKEA,"IKEA.se scammed me into paying double delivery fee, then hijacked the furniture I already paid for","I ordered furniture for +8000 SEK for my house in Sweden from Ikea.se. The order was scheduled for delivery today. Nobody called me about the delivery and hours later I got an email saying the delivery could not be done and to call customer service.From customer service I learned that - according to IKEA - the delivery driver had tried to call me once and I had not picked up. And they cancelled the delivery. If want a new delivery, I had to pay for deliver again. First of all, I did not receive this call, despite the fact that Ikea confirmed that my number was correct. I was literally waiting for the phone to call and I can see in my call history that NO ONE tried to call me.And now the very rude customer service representative requires me to pay again. I told her that wasn't fair since I didn't get the phone call and everything was ready for delivery. She finally told me that I wouldn't get delivery without paying for it again. And hung up on me without rescheduling another delivery, thus effectively hijacking my paid for furniture until I pay up. Now I have the option to either 1) NOT get the furniture I've already paid for, or 2) pay double fee for delivery, without any guarantee that I'll actually get my furniture - because, as I learned from the customer representative, if the driver can't reach me again, they'll also cancel the second delivery. And so on. I'm very surprised anyone choses to run a business this way in this day and age. The customer representative thought she was very generous and said Ikea could perhaps pay half the delivery fee, but it's not about the money, it's about what's right and fair. And so far, I've already paid 8000 SEK for nothing.",0,1

IKEA,Very unhappy with their customer service,"With my first order, everything went well. Delivery in time, good quality items for a good price. So I ordered something else. Shouldn't have done that... I paid over £100, delivery was promised for last Sunday. No delivery, just a message from the delivery company about a delay, with an update promised within 24 hours. No update. I raised an issue, the delivery company promised an investigation, since the parcel had kind of disappeared, result due within 3-5 working days, communicated to the sender, not me. But I was at least promised an 'initial update' within 24 hours. Then I contacted Ikea. They told me I just had to wait. I wanted to cancel the order, but was told this wasn't possible anymore since the items had been sent. Today, no 'initial update', nothing from Ikea either. They just leave me dangling. A good customer service would mean they either send the items again immediately, with me having to promise to send the first parcel back, in case it appeared again miraculously, and them sorting out the problem with the delivery company which, after all, they have chosen, or cancelling the order with a full refund. Instead, I have to wait a week, with no idea what will happen after that. I freely admit that I am a bit spoilt, being so impatient. But a customer-friendly company today simply delivers when promised or tries their utmost to remedy the situation if this does not happen and not just lets their customers wait. I have come to expect such a good service since most companies with online business offer it. Not Ikea, though. This will probably have been my last order with them, whatever happens with this package.P.S. I finally got Ikea to send a replacement. But, lo and behold - the next day the lost parcel was obviously found again and finally delivered, after a short additional delay. DPD apologized repeatedly for the delay, Ikea didn't. So even the fact that the package finally arrived does not merit more than one additional star. The customer service could have been a lot better.",0,3
IKEA,Ikea Barendrecht - really bad,This is a specific review to IKEA Barendrecht. They made a mistake with a delivery date and they are not even accessible to the customers. Like people don't have jobs or other things to do and to have a delivery on time they have to spend hours of their time trying to figure out Ikea Barendrecht's mistakes. Very very annoying.,0,1

IKEA,"Terrible delivery service, bad customer service","Not a great experience. I ordered a table from Ikea to be delivered on a Saturday as I work Sunday to Friday. I ordered some other things with it and the delivery service brought the smaller things but not the table. I then re-scheduled it for my next day off, the following Saturday, when it did arrive. Then Christmas happened, so the next available Saturday, I was ready to put it together. However, it was completely damaged on every corner. I called customer services who said that they would send somebody to get it, on the next Saturday. I gave up 4 Saturdays for a table that I couldn't put up! No compensation offer, nothing. And still no table!",0,1
IKEA,UPDATE:  IKEA came through!,"Ikea is great to shop for affordable furniture and their furniture is durable. I own a few pieces and have recommended some to friends. When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting over Thanksgiving I took them to the Columbus, OH store where they purchased a table top and 4 table legs. They were moving to a new apartment in January - 6 hours away in Michigan. When they moved in to their apartment, they attempted to assemble their table but one of the legs had a manufacturing defect and would not thread. We called the Columbus store and at first were told that we could return the $4.00 leg and get a replacement. My son explained they were 6 hours away from where they purchased it. He was told there was a store in Canton MI, but of course that was a mere 4 hours away. It would be highly inconvenient for them to make the 4 hour trip for a $4.00 leg, could they please send a new one? He said he was willing to pay for a new leg, he just didn't want to pay the shipping. I could return the defective one if necessary when I returned to Ohio. The CS representative told him she could not do that, so he asked for a supervisor. After some discussion, the supervisor appeared to understand the dilemma and appeared to want to help. He said he would send one out, he said he would send a shipping notice to my sons email when it was shipped, etc. When I first wrote this review I gave IKEA a one star because after all the talk, my son didn't receive a notification or anything and I really didn't think IKEA was going to send the leg, but I was on my way back to OH and my daughter-in-law called and said the leg had come! Thanks, IKEA. You came through! I can fully recommend even distance travelers!",0,5

I had to spend another 2 plus hours and they apologized and had to re submit a new order. They re -submitted my order and said they could deliver on the 20th of Jan. I cancelled my order.

Call customer support and get transferred around to different reps who leave no notes or have any idea of whats going on in a different department.

Ripping off.The website says for ordering the online items: ""Dit product is alleen online te bestellen OF VIA EEN MEDEWERKER IN DE WINKEL"": now this last one you can forget. In the shop they said it is a different system, they could not order it.And, when you finally decided to order it online, you go to your basket, the item is ""op voorraad"", and when you hit the Order button: ""Het spijt ons, de gekozen artikelen zijn nit op voorraad.

No issues with the packaging at all, all in tact and very very secure. All items were well packaged and were as expected.

It is a lot of money for a cheap particleboard that breaks when you try to put a screw in it correctly. Please don’t throw your money away like I did.

IKEA,@ikeawinnipeg WORST RETURN POLICY!!!,"@ikeawinnipegI tried to return a LACK coffee table that’s still inside the package unopened with a slight tear in plastic packaging. I lost my receipt and I am fully aware of the policy of having a receipt. However, I figured since the item was still unopened, I should at least get a store credit on the item. But they flat out said NO because there’s a tear in the plastic. I had to argue with the customer rep and told them that plastic is meant to tear and they don’t normally stay intact especially if it accidentally rubs onto something. But she still wouldn’t take it because they won’t be able to resell the product even though the item is obviously intact, no damage except for the little plastic tear...UNBELIEVABLE!!!! The WORST return policy I have ever heard and the WORST customer service ever😡",0,1

IKEA,IKEA two sofas and a rather uncaring attitutde,"We had two order numbers to buy a sofa from IKEA and had all kinds of problems. After we bought the 1st order on a ""click and collect"" basis, we went to the store to pick it up and found out that it had been cancelled by a staff member. We finally got the refund on November 28 after spending countless calls and time waiting on the IKEA customer service line. Since the store is far away from us we had to return home to order (we could not reorder at IKEA) it online. We arranged for delivery to our house. On the day of delivery, the driver did not have an important piece with him. For the inconvenience, we were given a $30 gift card (which we don't even want to use at this point). As we tried to assemble the sofa, we discovered that the pieces were completely wrong so the sofa had to be returned. The shipping charges were waived. While I was building the replacement sofa however, I was using the IKEA wrench that came with the sofa and due to a small sliver of metal that was protruding I badly cut my finger. It took me quite some time to staunch the bleeding. IKEA was quite concerned and when they called back to get the lot no. of the wrench, I had to lift the sofa (alone) from one side to the other until I finally found the number that they sought. You would think that they would have appreciated that but no. They offered (another) gift certificate which I refused saying that after injuring myself, helping them discover this production issue and having to move a heavy sofa alone, I would have expected more. Thereafter I was called by an IKEA manager saying that they did not credit any money for injury because there was ""no loss of money in a transaction"". I found this to be rather surprising. I was close to having to get stitches and after all of the time spent on the phone trying to call (they must have asked me to call back about 10 times with average wait times of 45 minutes), cutting myself and trying to help them by locating required information, I was astonished. I would have expected more. But alas, IKEA has changed.",0,1

IKEA,Blatant scam artists! Cannot believe such a big company can get away with this.,"Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed ""oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is"". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service. This returns policy means we are essentially stuck with the product and cannot get our money back.",0,1
IKEA,Fake return policy,"Fake return policy. Recent change to their return policy as of Nov 1, 2019. You have to have a receipt or card for them to return the item. They will not accept even if the product is damaged and refused to give you a store credit. Hang onto those receipts. Not happy!! We traveled two hours to return them and then had to donate it to ikea as we had no room in the car. Definitely not a 365 return policy.",0,1

IKEA,BEWARE OF THEIR SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE!,"BEWARE - IKEA removes bad review for their products from their website citing ""policy violation"" and refuses to explain which exactly policy does it violation when you talk to their customer service. This practice is as bad as quality of their products. So I'll post my experience with their product here for everyone to read.I know IKEA makes cheap furniture, I do not expect much believe me. But I was horrified how degraded IKEA quality over the years. I have a bookcase that I have purchased from IKEA about 10 years ago and it's a solid piece of wood, it's heavy constructed, still holding up fine. I wanted to replace it with two of these bookcases thinking that I'll be getting similar build level. I was so wrong. I guess IKEA cut all possible corners in 10 years to make it as cheap as it can be to manufacture. It's so flimsy and unstable, the sides are not solid pieces but just a frame with think inserts. The bookcase is constructed in a such way that it can not be put flush against a wall if you have baseboard because the read ""legs"" do not have a cutout for it. Quality of woodwork is horrible - it's uneven, unrefined and plain bad. Two of my side boards are not even glued properly and sliding back and forth in slots. I'm not going to talk about the design because it's non-existent. Paint is as cheap as everything else and while it's called dark-brown it's in reality simply black probably for the purpose of hiding bad wood quality. I will repeat again, I was extremely disappointed when I have unpacked the bookcase, this whole thing just screams in your face - CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Now I'm not sure if it's worth wasting my time to try to put it together or I can just throw it away immediately. I wouldn't complain if it would cost you $50 but for $150 this is just a robbery in a daylight. I will never recommend to anyone to buy anything in IKEA from now on, IKEA quality went too downhill in the last years.",0,1

IKEA,Do not buy a mattress from Ikea!,We went into store to buy a mattress for our granddaughter. We chose the hyllestad pocket sprung mattress after trying in store and with advice from the staff. We purchased a medium mattress and were reassured by the staff who said that we had 365 days to return it if it wasn’t suitable. We put the mattress in place however the mattress is rock hard with a ridge in it. We telephoned customer services who said that the 365 day return policy did not apply to mattresses as stated online. We were not told this in store. We have been advised that we can only exchange it for an alternative however Ikea acknowledge that the next mattress up isn’t available in a single. When we said it was not the same as the in store model that we had trialled customer services said that the store mattresses weren’t like the ones sold as people had tried them?? and they advised us to sleep on it until it became comfortable. Our granddaughter is only four and weighs just over 2 stones therefore her altering the mattress would be an impossibility! The mattress has been removed and is standing in our hallway as we have no use for it. We tried to write this review on the Ikea Website however Ikea have censored the review and have prevented us from submitting it. We have wasted a significant amount of time and money and will not purchase from Ikea again. We are shocked by the way Ikea have dealt with this problem and by the fact that they would not publish a truthful review. Shame on you Ikea!.,0,1

Apparently explaining that the drill bit is responsible for the hole in the wall not the picture frame is patronising..I raised a formal complaint by phone in early Oct and it emerges NOW that it was never processed as it wasn't written or typed. So I was deceived and wasted my time. They say I have to write and post the complaint to head office, having wasted two months of my time. Shockingly rude and rubbish products.",0,1
IKEA,IKEA customer service is awful!,"IKEA customer service is awful if you need to have them pull furniture. so, expect to wait over 30 minutes when they aren’t even busy. Next, you really can’t exchange - you can only return and then go through the incredibly long line again as they help can’t go get one and let you exchange. So, after waiting over 35 minutes to get a desk - i couldn’t exchange something. Poor customer service - especially as the pullers and return people were just standing around. Crazy!",0,1
IKEA,Disgustingly greedy store and people,"Trying to charge someone £40 for delivery when the item itself is £35 is greedy and disgusting.

Really expensive and extremely bad quality",0,1
IKEA,Not happy with Ikea,"I use ikea often. I buy bulbs from them because the bulbs have great life guarantees At least that's what I thought. 2 x E27 600 lm I bought last year went faulty. Both flash off and on and make crackling sounds so I brought them back to the store yesterday. I had no receipt but was certain they would replace the bulbs, but NO. They said they couldn't see on their system where I had ever bought bulbs on my family card and refused my request. I know my card wasnt recognised by their scanner a couple of times and they replaced my faulty card but this was rejected by the returns department. I'm very disappointed by this matter because the bottom line here is that these bulbs are obviously not as good as the IKEA staff member told me they were when he said they had a lifetime guarantee. He said if they go faulty, just return them and IKEA will replace them. Not true.",0,1

IKEA,We had the worst experience with the…,"We had the worst experience with the third party delivery company (XPO) IKEA uses in NY City. Their staff were incompetent, rude and aggressive with my husband and our building manager / concierge. XPO made several mistakes in delivering our furniture and we spent multiple hours on the phone for days trying to rectify that. The XPO staff also refused to deliver large items to our apartment but instead dumped them in the lobby of the building. The building has a service elevator so delivery to a particular floor is not a problem. My advice would be to avoid deliveries from IKEA in NY City. The time you would spend resolving problems with the delivery company would cost you a lot more than just buying your furniture elsewhere.",0,1
IKEA,IKEA MUST HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,Ikea has got to be the worst company I have ever dealt with Bought a dressing table/desk a few days ago started assembling then noticed a side panel was damaged so tried ringing my local Gateshead store would of been quicker walking the 15 mile trip to speak to customer services. Rang the helpline about 6 times to be put in a 20 to 30 minute wait and even after waiting the time they said still no answer so gave up without resolving my problem so another trip to the store at my time & expense. And they have the complaints procedure non existent so you are going round in circles to contact them AVOID AT ALL COST CHEAP COMPANY WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,0,1
IKEA,Terrible Customer Service! They just want your money.,Every single time I call to try to get help for my order I keep getting the same message - We did not receive your selection. Goodbye.Then it just automatically drops my calls.I was finally able to find some contact email to get through to them.So basically I put in a huge order almost 2 weeks ago and they were missing an entire couch I ordered. I've been trying to get them to send me my couch but so far no luck and one basic email saying how sorry they are. So far worst customer service ever. Not sure what to do. I really expect better for such a huge company.,0,1
IKEA,NIGHTMARE PURCHASE WITH IKEA,"Horrific, third party delivery company employed by IKEA. If you cant pick it up at the store and take it with you BEWARE! Let me just tell you that if you do not heed this advice and you trust them to deliver something to you in a manner that you will find pleasing and excellent....YOU ARE TAKING A HUGE RISK! I had to reschedule a delivery for some stand up mirrors (that I ordered online and spent over $500.00 + dollars for. I was challenged by uncaring, incapable and at worse, ignorant service personnel at every turn. To be fair, the employees of the third party deliver service that IKEA contracts with in the San Diego County area were the ones that I would corral into the ignorant and uncaring category. However, some of the staff at IKEA's 800 number fell into this category as well. It got to a point where they were mad at me for being frustrated. As if I didn't have a right after 3 failed delivery attempts (and broken promises by them) and me taking 2 days off from work to be there to receive my product and no delivery people showing up....and not even having the courtesy to call me and tell me that they weren't coming? The service failures are so egregious it nearly borders on conspiracy theory material. To this day, I have still never received my shipment nor gotten a refund. I even responded to several of their automated follow up messages and gave them a 1 star.....I still never heard anything from whomever was supposed to be monitoring the customer review process! It defies logic. I have never wished ill upon any company other than the perhaps say, the IRS. However, I do sadly hope that IKEA goes the way of the dodo bird and becomes extinct. This is because I truly feel they don't care about me/us enough to step up and listen when their clients are asking for their help. P.S. I noticed when looking for review sites for IKEA, that the independent review sites that IKEA does not control have VERY low scores from customers. However, IKEA's own client feedback site seems to contradict that with much higher aggregate reviews???? Um, who's review site do you trust? Pretty safe to say that the independent review sites like this one with an average customer review score of just over 2 is probably a lot closer to the truth. I hope this review has been helpful. Thank for taking the time to feel my pain. Trust me, I have much better things to do with my time :-( ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for nothing IKEA",0,1

You are pretty much on your own. Their recorded message for the After Sale Team is ""We have a higher than normal call volume please call back later"". If you speak to customer service they Transfer you to the After Sale Team. Where you will receive the same message again and again and again. A continuous irritating loop resulting in zero progress. No wonder why their call volume is higher than normal. I wouldn't do this again",0,2

IKEA,Ikea Germany,"Ikea Germany: total disaster! Absolutely not recommend.I have been an Ikea's customer since late 90's. In general I have been always satisfied with their products - design, quality vs price, etc. I had never problems with Ikea in Poland and Denmark. Never.In Germany things look different. I had huge problem with delivery. Delivery was delayed - and it wasn't my fault. I took a day off, stayed home to be sure everything will go smoothly. Unfortunately it didn't.Finally, after 12 days since I completed and paid for my order, I got my furniture. Everything at once. In a small apartment. Top 3 problems with Ikea Germany that make my really angry:1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to contact Ikea's tel. customer service. I tried more than 20 times. Different days. Different hours. The line was continuously busy. The line is unattended and it's even not possible to wait in a queue. Automated ""support"" inform you the line is busy, recommends you visit Ikea.de website and disconnects you! So good luck.2. Customer service via email works extremely slowly. You have to wait minimum 24 hours for an answer. Minimum.3. It's very difficult to find someone who can help you in English, but let's say that's my problem. On the other hand, Ikea is a global company and they hire a lot of people who speak English. In Denmark it's not a problem.I am truly disappointed by Ikea. My attitude to the company has changed dramatically. I just have a feeling that Ikea Germany doesn't care so much about its customers.With Ikea everything is seems to be ok when you come to the store. Pick up your stuff, pay and leave. If you expect additional service prepare for problems and ignorance.That's all.",0,2

IKEA,"Absolutely FUMING - Never, Ever, Ever Order from Ikea Online","Genuinely never had a worse retail experience in my life. This whole ordeal has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I made an online order of a mirror, a shoe rack, 4 glasses, a small ironing board and some reusable bags. Not one item was delivered in one piece or undamaged.For some reason my order was split into two deliveries. In the first was the mirror, which arrived completely smashed to pieces and my nice cream net bags and ironing board were covered in black dirt. The mirror was rescheduled for another delivery, fine. My other delivery with the shoe rack and glasses took a total of 2 weeks, 4 non-attempts to deliver by my driver (despite my partner staying home from work to take these deliveries in, the driver couldn't be bothered to ring the doorbell or call us). The delivery was finally made after 2 phone calls and 2 online chats (one with an insanely rude and unhelpful staff member called Matt - unbelievable, this guy should be sacked), but two of the glasses were smashed into tiny pieces and the shoe rack was really badly damaged (very deep scratches on top and one of the corners completely worn off). I called to complain last week, and was told the replacement delivery would be made today. I needed to change the delivery date so tried to call up, I was told to call DPD which cost me £6, even though I was told the replacement items would be delivered by Ikea themselves. I was told to just await my text concerning delivery and then I could make amends. There was also a possibility of it being delivered in the morning which would suit me but I was sent no text or email or anything concerning my delivery. I got onto the website chat service, was put into contact with who I think is the same rude Matt from before, who tells me they are actually out of stock and they were to re-access the stock and contact me on the 13th, two days from now.All of this wonderful delivery service cost me a whopping £39. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone with this entire experience. What on earth?? Please take my advice, and never order from Ikea online under any circumstance, it's not worth the stress or colossal amount of time you'll waste.UPDATE: I asked for a refund and I've only been refunded for the items and not the £39 delivery charge. I'm absolutely furious, never experienced anything close to this terrible experience before.",0,1
IKEA,"Don’t trust IKEA PAX Drawing program, it will cost you!","We designed our wardrobe (PAX) in their program. Everything seemed great until we got our delivery. Somehow An additional wardrobe was added to our order which we paid for as well. The wardrobe was nowhere to be found in the drawing we made. Further investigation showed that somehow an additional wardrobe was added outside the drawing area. Ikea agreed it was a technical bug that shouldn’t have happened but refused to help with picking up the additional wardrobe. It would cost me 800 to have them pick it up, which is equal to the price of the wardrobe. I am not able to return the product myself since the package is 220cm long and doesn’t fit in my car. IKEA’s customer service failed hard today. Acknowledging a problem but refusing the help out by offering a simple solution, to help their customer with a pick up. I used to be an IKEA fan, bought my kitchen there for +100.000 SEK but no more IKEA for me after this dreadful service.",0,1
IKEA,Where do I start,"Where do I start. I purchased a desk on the 29 Oct and exactly 1 year and 1 day later the drawer facia fell apart along the grain. When contacting both the store and customer services it was explained that because it was out of the 1 year warranty there was nothing they could do. This I can accept, however, there is no way of getting a new facia which means I either buy a new desk just to obtain the facia or as suggested by Cutomer Services, I look on eBay. Then I ask if there is any further way of complaining I am told no. I cannot even contact the manufacturer to get a replacement part. Great Customer at the heart process, I don't think so.",0,1

The email said nothing like I have 24 hours to pick up the items or they’re being returned. The things I bought were on sale and they are not honoring the sale price of me having to go back and buy them again. They also never communicated that the items are being refunded and returned. I still have not been refunded on my credit card, they said they will process the transaction eventually. They need way better communication and customer service.

IKEA,"Won't process return to an ""American"" CC!","I bought 500 USD worth of furniture in Japan. Eight months later, I had to return to the US and sent back all furniture new, unused, with the packaging not even opened. IKEA Japan has a 365-day return policy and I have several emails acknowledging I was owed a full refund. And then, because of an error on their end, they could not process a refund to my American credit card! I didn't understand - it was a MasterCard that can be used internationally. It was the same MasterCard they had no trouble charging 500 USD in the first place. For four months I've been arguing back and forth with IKEA. They will only mail a check to a Japanese address; I asked them multiple times to contact IKEA US for me, so that my American CC could be refunded. They refused. I reached out to IKEA US for help - they also refused. This is a total scam.",0,1

I was taking care of by Sandy that was able to return and then ship out a new one to the office that was in Chicago. She was great and they are lucky to have such a good employee.,0,5

Other items are now out-of-stock and another 4 week wait!!! Some other items would allegedly be delivered the following week. Sure, I trust you IKEA.

They charged my card when the order was placed, and it took them 5 days to ship it. Most online retailers charge you when they ship. So, they keep my money for 3-4 weeks from charge (order date) to refund. In addition to making it almost impossible for you to get customer service, to change an order, or to cancel an order.If they hold thousands or hundreds of dollar from customer like this, that sounds like a financial fraud.",0,1

I have 4 mangled PAX units and a Besta in my bedroom not attached to walls ( and I have an infant) for the last 3 1/2 weeks. If you have a problem you get sent to a different phone number or online for everything and you never get a person. Last night, I went to the planning center in Manhattan to ask about my pick up which I was emailed by someone would be today. The manager was kind enough to make a few calls and told me that my pick up had been rescheduled until Monday. He was emailing or texting with someone else. I was told they would take the damaged units as is if they fit through the door. Today, at 4:30 I had an IKEA delivery person in front of my building for a pick up. I live in Manhattan you can’t just show up at buildings whenever you want. There are delivery hours and COIs. The pick up delivery/guy refused to take the units. Frustrated I then took a cab back across town to speak with the manager who had sworn to me that no one was coming today when I went yesterday. Also, that I would not have to disassemble the units. If they fit through the door they would be taken. I will say, the delivery guy said that there had been a lot of complaints with IKEA recently. I do not doubt it. I think the people I encountered working there were very nice but the company is very big and there are HUGE management and communication issues.",0,1

The queen mattress appears not to be brand new but hope I would be wrong. The table was punctured before delivery and returned by delivery driver. I never received an explanation or any call from ikea customer service to understand what is going on and their plan to address the above deficiencies.

We purchased a KALLAK desk online on 30/08/2019 at 20:47 through the store in Wednesbury-Birmingham and paid for delivery at the store because we were advised that it was not available for store purchase and collection. We were unsure whether it would be right for our house and asked the store representative if we could cancel it after payment. The store representative specified that if we were to notify in time before the order is processed then that's fine. I went and cancelled in store within 24 hours. Sounds simple!However, the store couldn't get the refund done because it was an online order. How bizzare! That's the first time I've come across an online refund that couldt be carried out immediately without the order being processed because of the order being placed online in the store. Anyway, the store representative then raised a case (Case ID 32201051) and notified me that it will be refunded in 5 Working days. For reassurance he gave me a contact number 020 3645 0000 to ring and track the refund.I rang IKEA explaining the situation and they made it clear that I would receive the refund in 5 working days. I've tracked my online credit card and there has been no refund, even my statement does not show it. Its been almost 1 Month!I keep ringing but can't get through. This is wasting my time and money. I would advise not purchasing from IKEA unless you are 100% sure with your purchase.

I had a scheduled booking fail three times over almost a month, and they seem to have really no idea about what is going on. The service people are kind enough, but on some organizational level, IKEA fails immensely. That is why I will never recommend doing online deals with IKEA, what I have been through just truly sucks, and is a WASTE OF ENERGY.

Go to a store if you need to buy a product from them. I never received my purchase and when you call they ""transfer"" the call to someone who can do a refund, except that the call gets dropped EVERY TIME. They say they don't have ""space in the cue"" for all the calls. I've tried calling in the morning, afternoon, and night though. They never ""have spaced in the cue.""

(Job commitments mean there was no way I'd be present during normal hours)Delivery date and time arranged and I even made special arrangements to leave early to ensure I'd be back well ahead of the delivery window.I then get a text to tell me that the delivery has been moved TO THE FOLLOWING DAY! I've now wasted a lot of time having to ring up and speak to customer services to explain the situation, wasted my phone credit, wasted my time, put myself in the spot light for arranging to leave early at work all because the delivery agent couldn't do his job correctly.

Then another hour on a different day - there is no attempt to inform you how many people are ahead of you as every other major company does while you're waiting on the line. We emailed them on a Wednesday and no attempt was made to connect with us for upwards of 6 business days until we ONCE AGAIN, called.

You'd think that kind of money would make a business want to provide reasonable customer service or at least SOME customer service.The online system is a joke. The chat says I am number 1 in line with 0 minutes wait, then makes me wait for 10 minutes with no updates. After a rep finally joins the chat, they are very unprofessional: type like a drunk (missing letters or whole words, weiRd caPitaliZation, etc), ignore every single question I ask, and are obviously working multiple customers at the same time so I am left hanging for 5 minutes in between every tiny interaction. It took 30 minutes to schedule this simple appointment! While waiting for the agent, I called the local store. After making me punch in endless options, they announce that ""call volume is unusually high"" and then simply hang up! Not even an option to leave my name and number for someone to call me back.By now I received the confirmation of my order but the time was not the time I picked. I tried calling the customer service number on the order form twice only to have them hang up on me both times. I tried fixing it through chat but it said ""we are unavailable to chat with you at this time. Please try again during chat hours."" but I was chatting during normal business hours. I did finally re-schedule via email only to receive a phone call on the day that the technician was waiting for me at the house at the wrong time.

IKEA,2 days waiting for a truck that never came,"IKEA : no company has ever treated me as poorly as Ikea has. I'm furnishing a new apartment, and I ordered several hundreds of dollars worth of items from Ikea's website. This was 3 weeks ago, and I still haven't received anything. I had a delivery scheduled for 09/08. I received a confirmation that the delivery would be made between 12 and 4pm, so I stayed home from work waiting for the delivery. It didn't arrive and no one bothered to let me know that it won't be happening (the online tracking system kept saying it's on the way), so I've wasted an entire day waiting for a truck that never came. The following day, after several hours on the phone later I have rescheduled the delivery for today, 09/14. The delivery never arrived, but the driver marked it as 'delivered' (someone at XPO told me in a matter-of-fact tone that drivers sometimes do that so that they can get paid without going through the trouble of actually making the delivery. I now took two days off of work and still have no clue what's going on. I've also spent easily over 5 hours on the phone with Ikea / XPO and I'm disgusted with the service I've received. The prevalent attitude seems to be 'not my problem'. I've had people hang up on me, managers promise to call me within an hour with an update (whether they learn something or not) and never actually call, all mixed with the usual 10-20 minutes on hold. Not one person knows where my order is and it seems like no one cares either. Ikea graciously offered to refund the 40 dollars I've paid for the delivery, valuing a day of my work at 20$. According to people in the resolution department Ikea has done nothing wrong and apparently doesn't care to make even the slightest gesture of making up for me losing two days of work, several hours on the phone, and an extra week of not even having kitchen utensils.

So far these jokers have stolen 9 hours of my life from me! If/When the new sofa arrives, it will be the last thing I ever buy from Ikea, which is presumably Swedish for NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!",0,1
IKEA,Horrible horrible customer service,"Horrible horrible customer service. First no one ever answer the phone.. you listen to a whole bunch of recordings and then get cut off. I purchased an item in which the glass was broken and drive all the way from the city to Long Island to exchange. I was told that for exchanges you return your defective product and staff will bring you a new one. After waiting for 2 hrs for the next exchange representative, she treated it as return and add us go back inside to get it our selves. We wanted to open the package to see if the new product didn't have any defects. I was given a run around which took more time and finally they couldn't even supply me with scissors and tape to check a newly purchased item. I'm sorry but customer service is almost nonexistent and hopeless.",0,5

IKEA,My first visit to ikea after my friend…,"My first visit to ikea after my friend recommended it to me to buy wardrobe was really disappointing and racist. I was waiting 15 minutes to get served and was told the woman was on break and to continue waiting. So I did, and then 15 minutes passed and another couple just came and waited in line at the wardrobe area. The woman finished her break and went straight to help the white couple. I informed her I was waiting for a while and was there before them and requested her to help me first as I was searching for her throughout the entire store, I even asked her coworkers where she was. The couple even knew I was there first and we’re more than happy for her to serve me first. So she did, although she was EXTREMELY rude and was not even helping me, instead she was rushing to get back to the couple because apparently they had an appointment. So I told her to go help them and to please return to assist me afterwards. She asked if they had an appointment and they did not. Instead, they had the exact same question as I did about the exact same lights. I was waiting at the same area as the couple and the woman and over heard her being the nicest person I have ever seen. Then when she was done with them, she turned to me and started yelling at me and telling me I was rude for requesting to be served first even though I was there first and the couple did NOT have an appointment with her. I was so baffled that she treated me the way she did all due to my hijab. She told me off and told me to wait where I was and sent me Isiah D. who was MORE than helpful and continued apologizing for the actions of this woman. I just do not understand why I was treated with such disrespect from this woman, and it was not isiahs job to apologize for her actions and hurtful words. Because of isiah’s help I was able to buy three thousand dollars worth of housing equipment. Although isiah was able to make my experience better, it was still extremely upsetting and racist the way I was treated and I will not be returning to IKEA. It’s upsetting to see that racism is still a huge issue in our world, especially in an area where you are a customer service representative and should be treating people with the upmost respect.",0,1

They are inaccessible, and even when you finally can reach a person, they are unhelpful and often unresponsive. I've had significant serious issues with deliveries, parts needed after the fact, and general questions, and in no instance have I gotten a satisfactory resolution to the issue. It's really hard to buy their larger items, as I'm aways worried what will happen if I need some kind of help. It's really a shame.For example...I’m trying to buy a somewhat custom drain/trap for an IKEA sink. You can’t. You actually have to buy the whole sink. Just for the drain/trap. True story.",0,1

I contacted IKEA, when I finally attempted an outdated browser and was able to complete the form. Actually got a quick response and was promised a replacement part. Sadly, they opted to use a courier for delivery and didn't pass on my phone number, so a week later they still hadn't delivered and I called IKEA. They didn't want to take responsibility, and basically left it for me to sort out. I work. I'm not at home between 9am and 5pm. That's why my original delivery was on a Sunday. Several other calls to IKEA and an escalation to a supervisor who is yet to follow up, I finally received the replacement part. And you know what? All 4 corners are damaged! This is beyond ridiculous, and extremely poor customer service. Never again! I'd offer 0 stars if that was an option.",0,1

IKEA,"Ugh, going to have to divorce Ikea now","Ugh. I used to love Ikea. Ordered furniture online from Ikea, had confirmed delivery date and 4 hour window from their logistics Co. XPO. No-call no-showed. I called Ikea the next day and after much back and forth between Ikea and XPO was told the XPO truck ""broke down"". Rescheduled for later in the week. Had a confirmed delivery date and 4 hour window. No-call no-showed. Another call into Ikea and XPO, no excuse given this time, just that they were ""unable to make the delivery ontime"". My reply was to ask them to ensure that the delivery would be made early the next morning, like any other company would do when they failed to fulfill a simple service. The best they could offer was redelivery in 3 days. Unacceptable, but what could I do, they were holding my furniture hostage at that point. Third confirmed delivery date, with 4 hour window. Again, no-call no show. This time we DROVE out to the local Ikea and tried to get an explanation, which they had none since it was ""in XPO's hands"". Later that night I got a robocall from XPO explaining that ""the truck broke down"". Was given a FOURTH confirmed delivery date with a 4 hour window. Again, a no-call no-show. Four wasted days waiting for a delivery that never arrived, with poor customer service from both Ikea and XPO to boot. We canceled the order with Ikea (we will miss shopping your store, but this online experience was just oh-so frustrating), placed an order with Wayfair for a nearly identical item that was delivered in two days via Fedex. 8 days later, still waiting for my refund from Ikea, I guess I'll dip my toes into the water and call customer service, AGAIN.",0,1

IKEA,Ikea assemble team,"This rating is not for our experience in IKEA Dublin but for the attitude and end product we got from the assemble team (One member in particular) who came to our home and put together our wardrobe.We spent almost 2 thousand euro (400 euro approx. on labour) on a wardrobe which was tailored in store to fit our dimension requirements. All panels arrived by Ikea's courier on the Friday and the 2 man assemble team arrived on the Monday. When they arrived, the senior assembler was angry that the panels weren't in the bedroom with all of the wrapping removed. When trying to explain that there was only a pregnant woman present at home when the courier delivered the panels and that there was no way she could've brought them upstairs, he didn't seem bothered and gave my partner attitude because 'she should've had this done before they arrived'. He had a poor attitude throughout the duration they were here. They came without a blueprint of any description of what we ordered. Expecting us to provide photos of what we ordered. This, in my opinion should be prepared by IKEA and provided to the assemble team as it was built using a virtual program in store. As there was no blueprint, they ended up building a wardrobe that was not in the arrangement which we agreed on in store.After paying 400 euro for labour I expected a better service.",0,1

They never contacted us and no parcel ever arrived. They have stolen 110 euros from us and wasted so much of our time. I have written a complaint email but they have not responded. We have informed the credit card company who are now looking into it. IKEA act in a negligent and criminal way. How can a company this size to that?

IKEA,No Delivery and No on the Spot Refund?,"Until this week, was a great believer in Ikea, being a regular customer in Australia and Europe over years. However a refusal of an immediate refund of around $140 for an online order that was not delivered by Toll as promised, has left me gobsmacked.I have cctv footage of the truck arriving and 2 different drivers on 2 different days putting a missed delivery card under my door without any attempt at ringing doorbell. Ikea are stating the parcel shows as ""delivered"" by Toll. I also rang Toll for the second time today and finally was put through to someone in Australia so I could raise a complaint and she said the parcel is sitting at Tullamarine. I am very unhappy as my contract is with Ikea and not with Toll. I said I had over 3 days attempted to manage this delivery on line and on phone with Toll and I was done. Asked Ikea to intervene and was told I had to go back to Toll. I said I would no longer do that as I had no confidence in them and I would not waste another day hoping for someone to ring my doorbell. So then I demanded a refund. Seems I have to raise a dispute because Ikea will not guarantee a refund or when I will get it. Lose a loyal customer over $140....and I have all the video evidence.So far spent more than 1 hour on phone with toll, 3 times on line managing delivery all with conflicting information, 2 calls to Ikea wasting at least another 2 hours. Come on. Put yourself in my shoes. I only asked for a refund because your agent said they would not make arrangements with Toll on my behalf, I had to do it again. This time I refused as I have no confidence in them. Now I have a driver complaint raised with Toll and I hope to be able to submit my video evidence of the drivers not ringing my bell. I have confirmed the parcel is on the Toll system as sitting at Tullamarine. The Toll agent said that Ikea staff were reading their information wrongly to say the parcel was showing as delivered. I told Toll the parcel would be returned to sender as I had no faith in their drivers to do the right thing. Now I have to wait for Ikea to investigate and get around to giving me a refund of around $140. Tomorrow I will waste more time on the phone with my bank, raising a disputed charge with them as well as now I no longer trust Ikea after sales service to put the customer first.",0,1

I have tried calling multiple times (the reps are too busy and I need to call back at another time) and emailing as well however I haven’t gotten any response and my account was charged $320 even though the items were never picked up. I am extremely frustrated with IKEA as the Click & Collect terms say that orders not picked up w/in 24 hours will be cancelled, the order was processed although the items were never received and I was unable to cancel the order online. Ikea will not respond I have been charged for $320 and have not received any service or goods.",0,1
IKEA,Delivery is awful.,"Delivery is shockingly awful. How dare they charge £39 for delivery and get it wrong without trying to solve the problem or with no explanation! We ordered a wardrobe on the Monday evening and expected the delivery the next day within the slot 12:00 - 18:00. We had waited in all day for the delivery and didn’t get notified that our delivery couldn’t be delivered that day as we payed 1 minute past 10pm! We had wait an hour on the phone to find out where our delivery was. They then explained they will deliver on the Wednesday (the following day) when they turned up with our product, there was only half of it there. They had left the other half behind. We explained there is 11 boxes missing to the drivers and said they will get the store to call us and re deliver the following day. We was then waiting for a call and didn’t get one so we had to wait another hour on the phone to ikea explaining our situation and it turns out the drivers had lied and said we received all our packages! They then said they will get it re delivered on the Sunday. Again we’ve been waiting all day and nothing turns up! They couldn’t get our products to us that day ... AGAIN! And said they will TRY to deliver on Tuesday! This is a joke. How on earth do they take your money plus £39 for delivery and mess everything up without any care in the world. This is disgusting ! Won’t be ordering again.",0,1
IKEA,Totally let down by Ikea home delivery…,"Totally let down by Ikea home delivery leaving 2 holiday guests with beds. We paid for a bunk bed and two mattresses to be delivered 7 days after purchase. On the morning of agreed delivery I received a message to say that could not delivery as scheduled, Ikea customer service had no idea why and ask me to phone them again later in the day! meanwhile I had a text message from their delivery logistics company telling me the goods where loaded and they would meet their delivery slot times between 0900 and 1300. 14.00 hrs came and I phoned Ikea customer service and put on hold for 10 minutes, they came back and said the lorry was too full and we would have to have to agree a new date for delivery, the earliest they could offer was in a further 10 days...no options no possibilities and no offer to find a solution. It happens often and we are expected to put trust in a new date. Needless to say with guests arriving that day we were well and truly let down and Ikea would offer no customer service solution...very disappointing.",0,1

IKEA,Satisfied with my experience with IKEA,"It was easy to trade with IKEA. The package arrived a few days after I placed the order. That was really nice, thank you.

IKEA,Horrible online shopping experience,"My husband ordered a bed worth over $600 online on 04 July 2019 at 10.26pm . He got confirmation that it would be delivered on 09 July 2019 by Fedex. The next day, 05 July, he called to cancel the order and it was all good with Ikea. Nevertheless, Fedex came and dumped the items outside our condo in Old Montreal on the same day (09 July 2019) unsigned for and unguarded. My husband got home from work and saw the items outside and took them upstairs (to 4th floor without elevator. Mind you IKEA claims that they deliver without elevator up to 3rd floor). After this, our ordeal with Ikea began. Calls after calls, we spoke to several managers after 50 minutes wait on the phone on average to speak to someone in after sales. They'd promise someone would come the next day and no one would show. We even spoke to a manager who had the guts to suggest we put it in a car and drive it over to them even after I told him we didn't have a car and that we placed the order online and paid for delivery. He promised he'd arrange a truck himself to come and pick it up. Another day lost and nothing. So, at that stage we decided to call the bank and request that the payment made by credit card be reversed since Ikea was holding our money and refused to give us a refund. The bank initiated the reverse process and it was then that Ikea decided to come and collect their bed. They promised a $75 dollar voucher which we still haven't seen. The whole ordeal took 3 weeks to settle. We decided to give Ikea a second chance given their gesture of goodwill ($75 voucher) and ordered items worth over $500 online again. I paid for express delivery (next day). I got confirmation once the payment went through on IKEA.com that the items would be delivered today, 04 August between 9am and 1pm. I get two missed calls from Ikea at around 9.49am. I tried to call the number and couldn't get through to anyone so I called the 800 number. The guy could not find the order number I gave him, which I had received from Ikea.com (and I never got an email confirmation). Then he used my phone number and other verifications to find the order. It had a completely different number. He thought I had got it wrong but I told him I had made a screenshot of the confirmation and read it to him twice. Then he tells me that there must have been a mistake because the order was made in-store. I was shocked. I never went to the store to make the order. He could not explain what happened. They have a glitch in their system and no one has the bleakest idea they did? It turns out my delivery was scheduled between 5pm and 9pm, therefore I had lost my morning, and now I was going to lose the entire afternoon/evening. So, I spent my entire Montreal Summer Sunday waiting for Ikea. Past 9pm, nothing! I call again and again. Wait time of course 30-50mins on average, only to be told that nobody knows why my order has not arrived so some delivery dept. person would call me on Monday. I guess I will have to reverse the payment again and they should do what they wish with their stuff!DO NOT SHOP ON IKEA.COM! YOU WILL NEVER GET WHAT YOU ORDERED!!

So I called ikea, and they said they would sent me a new one, not to mention getting ahold of them is almost impossible. So a week later, when it was supposed to have arrived, once again it didn’t, because the same thing had happened AGAIN. I was AGAIN never notified, and when I try to call them it says they are too busy to take my call. This is ridiculous. I just want my package.

Alas, I can't get hold of anyone. Their phone system doesn't even put you on hold, it just says they're too busy to take your call and hangs up. Emails aren't returned.

I have to say that this order was planned with Ikea team for hours, all the measurement were known to them when we made the order.Now, we have to chase them for the refund because the order is listed as delivered although it was with them all along.Plus, we will move to the house without the closets and it will take us about 2 month to get new one since its summer.If you want to buy from ikea, I suggest to buy small things only.I will not come near it in the near future if ever.",0,1

IKEA,Missing items .. no bed for baby . 4 day wait,"So, I’ve got to say IKEA customer service is the worst I’ve ever encountered. Got the items delivered but after building the first item, the second (a wardrobe) had parts missing. Rang IKEA to ask them to arrange for delivery of the missing parts and got told I’d have to wait until Saturday! Now, because I needed to build the wardrobe before the bed (due to space in the room), this meant my 19 month old would have no bed until Saturday, and IKEA were quite happy with this. Not good enough, after going round in circles for over 30 mins I said I would drive to IKEA, about 100 mile round trip! IKEA could not guarantee to cover my fuel and refused to refund the delivery, they offered only a £10 voucher for me to spend in store! I refused this as got told I couldn’t have both voucher and fuel (if they agreed to cover this in-store). After going round in circles on the phone the call operator refused to pass the issue up the chain and to give me any details of where to complain to and ask for any type of refund. When in-store they agreed to cover fuel cost (not sure it covered the fuel but they have a basic rate per mile that is non-negotiable). Gets even better, as when leaving IKEA, I saw loads of vans and also hire vans that they could have used to deliver my goods that they didn’t pack. I have just finished building the items at 23.25 so at least my little girl has somewhere to sleep, not that IKEA could care! Going to post on all sites I know but hold little hope of getting any kind of apology or refund as they seem to have unlinked themselves from IKEA on trust pilot! They obviously enjoy taking your money but when things go wrong and they are at fault they cannot accept it and actually make it more stressful. Like I said, the worst customer care I’ve ever had. IKEA won’t be seeing any more of my money!",0,1

IKEA,"Order delayed for 14 days, no real solution given ...","I've been shopping with IKEA for a while but had a bad experience when an order went wrong ...On July 2nd I made my order online for several items. They were scheduled for delivery on July 10th. I received an email back with a summary of my order, and a message saying i would receive a confirmation of the order within 48 hours. After three days I didn’t receive any confirmation and so I sent a Facebook message (July 5th) asking about my order. I got a response quickly, and the representative told me someone would look into it to see if the order / payment went through or not, and that they would be happy to book or rebook for me. I was also told that I would get an email within a few days if they were able to book/rebook. So it sounded fine ...But I didn’t receive any emails. I checked in again when I got no response, and the representative told me to check in again in two days.Then, the second time I checked in I was told the department was away and that I would have to wait longer ... Then FINALLY, 11 days after asking, on 14 July I was told that the payment didn’t go through and I would need to rebook the whole thing. (And of course, you often have to wait a few days to a week for a delivery to be scheduled and to arrive.) My delivery was supposed to arrive more than a week ago, now it will probably be another week or two ...Here's what I'm not happy about. If I’d known from the beginning my didn’t go through, I would have simply rebooked and not had to experience such a delay. It was very confusing I got an automated email that summarized my order but that the order didn't go through. Also strange that the department was ""away"" and nobody knew the status of the order until 11 days after I asked about it. And of course annoying that I had to check in a few times only to get nowhere ...For all of that I thought it was reasonable to ask for some sort of discount on my rebooking. They said it was not possible but that they would offer me two free lunches to visit their store ... I don't really see that as a good solution though since I was never planning to go to the store in person and would need to spend money to drive or take transportation there. I told the rep that, and the rep said ""I cannot offer you anything of more value."" The customer service team was trying to be helpful I think, but unfortunately it seems they can't offer anything of real value to upset customers or provide much assistance when problems come up. The good thing is that the customer service reps were pretty quick to respond. So I don't blame the people I spoke to -- but the system, policies, and how it's set up which doesn't make much sense to me.",0,2

I tried phoning IKEA at 888-888-4532 multiple times to report the missing part. Every time the recorded message said the phone lines were busy and hung up. I then submitted the ""Missing/Damaged Merchandize"" form online, reporting the missing part. Instead, I was informed that a replacement for the entire sleeper sofa would be shipped and that I would have to disassemble the first sleeper sofa for return to IKEA. I refused the second shippment and replaced the missing part at my local lumber company at my expense. An attempt to write a review on the IKEA site failed because the review button was inoperative.

During this period, we have received several promises, none of them were fulfilled. We were not able to use the kitchen for any function during this period.

It's impossible for their to be any other excuse.Delivery due this morning between 9 and 1.Update sent at 10.05 advising tracking showing order will be with me between 10.37 and 11.37.Checked update at 11.20 advised me that delivery expected between 11.31 and 12.31. It also states that the driver has 2 visits to complete before he comes to me.Therefore the original delivery time of 10.37 to 11.37 is a LIE an d made up.I've run logistics teams for over 10 years you cant have this level of movement if the original time was genuine and based on anything.Its not IT IS A TOTAL LIE.I for one will never use IKEA again.I REALLY DO HATE BEING LIED TO,0,1

While the shopping experience is rather excellent, and so is the price - the actual quality of the products can vary by a lot depending on what you buy.

Alternatively, the shoe rack and hamper are still in fine condition and costed next to nothing - so just choose your products carefully.",0,3

Took the day off to sign for it and only one of the beds was delivered! After 4 1/2 hours on the phone with IKEA ( what professional with kids has time to spend 4 1/2 hours holding for customer service when they are at fault ??!) because I had to call back three times from being disconnected, she was rude told me it wasn’t even available even though they charged me and that it could take 10 days to get my refund even though they are at fault. Barbara in their customer service department should not be working customer service! I even asked for her identification number so I could let management know and she said they don’t do that they only give their first name. Snotty and rude, that completely their fault! It’s not supposed to be billed until the item is shipped. Yet they billed me for two beds yet only one was shipped and yet I have to wait 10 days for a refund?

They ""misplaced"" the order first, and it took three weeks to ship to us, even though the item was in stock at the very location we ordered in from, which was only 20 minutes from our home. Then, the delivery men arrived during a rain storm, and asked ""can we come back another time? It's raining hard out there..."" all passive-aggressive-like. Sorry that your job sucks, dude, but it's still your job. They grumbled and bumped and scratched it all the way up, no doubt on purpose, then we find out that they sent us the wrong product! Then, when we try to have it shipped back, IKEA has the gall to refuse to pay shipping, and tried to make US pay for THEIR mistake!

I called the phone number given for customer service 5 different times and got the message that they were experiencing a ""high volume of calls"" and was directed to go to their website. These calls were placed both morning, evening and afternoon! I went to their website and explained the problems online, and received NO response from this as well. The phone number is the ONLY number you can call. There is no number direct to the store where I purchased the items. My receipt says I must report this claim within 48 hours! I guess I will drive to the store today with the damaged pieces - but I am very concerned that they will not help me. I am not only disappointed but very frustrated. What has happened to IKEA? I have purchased items before - many times- though several years ago. I never had any problem with any products nor customer service before. There is something very wrong.",0,1

(1) to take another day off work and wait for their potential delivery as a “gesture of goodwill”(2) make my way to a store on the other side of London to pick up the order at my own expense.

It was glass and wasn't even packed properly! No bubble wrap and was in a box 2 times larger than the box the product was in. I called IKEA's customer service number (which is a joke). For damaged items, the recording said they were not taking any calls at this time. So.... I called back to speak with someone in sales, *since I knew they would answer). They rerouted me to the correct dept., and I waited close to a half hour for someone to pick up, but no one ever did.So....went on line and submitted a complaint about my broken item. Normally, when you deal with a decent company, they send you a courtesy letter that someone is checking into the issue and will be in touch within a certain amount of time. I've heard nothing from IKEA. Actually, they have lost a customer due to their horrible customer service. I don't even care about the broken pedestal anymore. I will never, ever order anything from this company again. I hope this will deter other's from dealing with this unresponsive company. Shame on them!",0,1

Now I have a useless credit card that I can't close so I don't hurt my credit score and $25 off I can't use. Customer service was no help AT ALL.

IKEA,This is my worst eCommerce experience,"This is my worst eCommerce experience, bar none. If you want to buy something from Ikea, drive to the store even if it's 4 hours away, it will be less work than trying to convince someone to deliver it to you.I do like Ikea's designs but fulfillment is not their bag, do yourself a favor and go get it yourself.Their customer service is nonexistent. You feel like you've slipped somewhere between a CIA behavior control experiment and the 8th circle of hell.I've never had the pleasure being on hold for 2 hours. Not only that, it was to the wrong department and when they're transferred me the system dropped the call. Truly a singular experience!The way the system is supposed to work:1. you place an order2. you get a phone call with a delivery window (robot, use a cell phone, don't use your business line)3. After you confirm they'll deliver.What actually happens:1. you place an order2. you never get a phone call3. they send an email stating that they missed the delivery and they might cancel the order / charge you for re-delivery and you need to call them4. you call them, wait on hold for 2 hours. When you finally get a person they say you've reached the wrong department and they need to transfer you. When they transfer you the system tells you the call volume is too high and hangs up.5. repeat6. you call at 6AM to reach them at opening time on the east coast and reach a person. They reschedule the delivery and tell you you should get a phone call from the delivery company the day before.7. You don't get a phone call.8. You call the delivery company (T Force) and they tell you they have no record of your order. You ask them to talk to Ikea, and after being pushier than you should have to be they finally find your order with Ikea. (quick tip: T Force can skip the Ikea phone call queue) They tell you that Ikea has rescheduled your delivery and it will arrive Monday.10. You get another email promising a Monday delivery11. You don't get a confirmation call (again)12. You call T-Force back and again they can't find your order. (again) They talk to Ikea again. Hang up on you at least once. Call back. And you're told they're positive your order is cancelled and the only way to get a delivery is to place the order again.In all I have 6 delivery dates that Ikea promised. Spent more time on hold than the round trip would have been to Ikea's store. My wife I and I both called T Force and Ikea countless times. Never once did we get a confirmation phone call. (we had them check the phone number, in case, and it was fine) So at this point I'm going to certify myself insane if I try this again.So I looked online and saw that sensible people where calling their credit card company to have the charges reversed. After only a few minutes on the phone, that was done.Good riddance to bad rubbish.I have the sneaking suspicion that T Force shares a large part of this responsibility. It was their system that never called me. I live in Santa Maria, California which may be way outside their normal delivery radius. I wouldn't be surprised that they simply couldn't make money making my delivery and their system simply kicked me out logistically as irrelevant. Then Ikea points figures at T Force and T Force points fingers at Ikea and they both hope you just go away.",0,1

I should look again tomorrow and call back if not delivered then. No help from Ikea and I've never heard of a shipping company claiming delivery when it's on the truck still. I called FedEx and they were very concerned about a missed delivery. They found the package the next day and delivered it. Ikea could care less.

IKEA,Oh no! Ikea,"I ordered Ikea's play kitchen for my niece on the 20th May for delivery 22nd - to arrive in time for her birthday on the 25th. Instead of being given my one hour delivery slot on the 22nd I was sent a text saying my parcel had been delayed due to an unexpected issue, then the day after another text with the same message but preceeded by an 'oh no!', which was a bit bizarre. (Glad they find it so ironic) Rang DPD the delivery firm and got litttle information - call handler reading from a script promised delivery by ten that evening - but, it's now the 25th and still no delivery and no update. (Some of the calls to DPD are charged at a premium rate, so you can potentially pay six pounds to NOT discover why your order hasn't arrived) Ikea were polite and tried to be helpful but have no access to DPD's system and can't advise but can only apologise. So this is an ongoing review as to how bad DPD and therefore Ikea can actually manage to be - a week late with their delivery? Two maybe? Who knows - definitely not me - meanwhile i'm the awful aunt without a birthday present.It turns out that DPD and Ikea CAN better their awful record to date. My play kitchen wasn't delayed it was lost in DPD's system and they should have known at the beginning because if their records show a parcel hasn't been scanned it should throw up a 'red flag'. But in this case no red flag. (Tellingly, when ringing DPD, customers are forced to listen to a recording of the 'director of customer experience' urging them to be nice even if they're annoyed or want to let off steam.) So I return to to Ikea who issue gushing apologies and re-order the play kitchen to arrive on the 31st May. And, I'm gobsmacked to find, it's another no show on this date. DPD say they have no record of my re-order so back to Ikea who issue more gushing apologies because they've pushed my delivery date back to June 2nd and, despite having my mobile number and email, didn't bother to tell me. The customer service adviser agrees with every word I say, for example, your customer service is awful, your customer service is a farce and quite possibly a pantomime too, treating customers like this is inexcusable etc etc. (She doesn't seem to mind a bit of annoyance and letting off steam. perhaps desensitized after receiving so many complaints). So I'm still waiting to discover, twelve days past my original delivery date, will the play kitchen arrive!!June 2nd - still no delivery. Ikea now tell me that my re-order has been blocked due to the way the re-order was re-ordered! Assurances that everything will be successfully unblocked, authorised and ready to go some time in the future. Yawn, yawn. Can't even be bothered getting annoyed or letting off steam anymore. If you want anything from Ikea, GO TO THE STORE TO GET IT.My order finally arrived two weeks late. Woo hoo Ikea. Now all I have to do is assemble it!I emailed my complaint to Ikea over two weeks ago cataloguing each painful and frustrating step in the process of securing a delivery from them.

IKEA,"Horrible customer service, ignorant store","We drove 128 miles to the IKEA Conshohocken store and we purchased 3 sofas and other items total over 2500 dollars and the store informed us they can deliver 2 sofas but they don't have the third one in their warehouse so they basically told us we either have to take it today with us they can't deliver it which wasn't right since we paid for the flat rate delivery anyway and they didn't make any exception or compensation even though this wasn't our fault. We wanted everything delivered. We agreed to take one sofa home and they said they will help us with the order. They gave us the sofa and the sofa cover and we paid for everything and drove back home. We got home and put the sofa together only to find that they gave us a cover for a chair, not a sofa. I contacted the customer service and spoke to Tiffany who was very rude and unprofessional. She informed me I have to drive back to the store to return that one and get the right one and that is the only option. I explained that this wasn't our fault, they did us wrong from the beginning and she didn't care. I was on hold for 55 minutes then she told me there is nothing they can do I asked to speak to a supervisor, she put me on hold for another 15 minutes then she told me there is no supervisor available and I requested a call back and documenting this incident then she said there is a supervisor available now. She asked me to hold and I did for another 10 minutes then they hanged up. I am ready to give birth in 10 days and I explained to her this is a 50 dollar problem and we paid 2500 they should be able to deliver the correct item for us as a courtesy. I was treated badly and felt like crab. This is not customer service and the store, the customer service and their supervisor should be held liable for their unprofessional action. This is my first time buying from Ikea and will be my last.",0,1
IKEA,I went to Ikea based on the website…,I went to Ikea based on the website telling me product was in I also called before I went and got the same I information. When I arrived with a friend we couldn't find product. We ask help from sale person. She too could not find and saw that the computer system said that there was product in stock. As ager CE she saw the same thing. She called to see when new product was coming I told say May 4. She took my phone number and email and said if problem someone would call. I went in day as no call and voila no product. If I lived on Toronto and could take public transit not an issue.but I live in Oshawa. The sale person and manager were really nice and frustrated as o was. There inventory system sucks. There head office trying to spin it as if my fault. Dah. When one is told they would get a call if problem one expects a call. Since it was not only me but some one else with me. I believe Ikea is wrong and should compensate me for my gas. Terrible.,0,1
IKEA,Not worth the hassle,"Ordered a bed in store last month (can’t purchase assembly online - another gripe) with delivery and assembly date of 7th May. That same day got a phone call saying 7th wouldn’t work and it would have to be the 14th (apparently they only deliver to my area - an hour outside Edinburgh - on Tuesdays). Called today as I need to postpone it - was told that delivery was still for 7th - which is today. When that didn’t happen, I called AGAIN only to find the delivery date can’t be changed to 21st May only 4th June. Soooo fiddly and frustrating and experience varies hugely between call handlers. Some of them are just awful. Don’t bother. Also, keep your receipt, the staff on phones won’t talk to you if you don’t have your order number.",0,1

IKEA,WARNING about IKEA assembly  services…,"WARNING about IKEA assembly services through Task Rabbit (a company that IKEA apparently acquired, so Task Rabbit Canada =IKEA Canada but IKEA customer service tries to tell you otherwise ). Read very carefully Task Rabbit’s terms and conditions for using YOUR personal information — if you read that you might not want to do any business with them! I bought a bed with drawers on Easter weekend and was told I could book assembly quickly via a link online (through Task Rabbit). Tried to book assembly only to get stuck on Task Rabbit platform because they ask for “postal code” but don’t mean where you want the assembly done but mean your credit card billing address postal code. So I entered the postal code for where I wanted the goods that I had delivered assembled (and my credit card information including code on back) just to have the link not work (but was able to find out through my credit c co. that Task Rabbit apparently did a check of my credit c billing address! So their online platform tells you nothing about where your credit card info went and you just get a link that doesn’t work to get you to the next step of connecting with an installer — but someone has that info to be calling my credit c company. Task Rabbit customer service useless - you get different replies from different people (just like at IKEA). you get automatic reponsr saying your email may be answered in “days”. To top it all off a Google search of Task R reveals they were the subject of a data breach! So this company now has my credit card information and was unable to use it for he purposes intended (assembly) but has it while the customer wonders why the screen is not advancing to the next step. IKEA does not care about a customer’s post purchase experience — instead trying to blame it on a totally independent company TAsk Rabbit (which is really IKEA). Their “customer service” agents are rude and try a lot of doubletalk! Think twice before dealing with IKEA on any items requiring delivery and especially assembly through Task Rabbit (and check that you really agree to Task Rabbit’s privacy policy and terms and conditions for doing business with you. Is this what you want with a company that had a major data breach?? Also be prepared to get spam emails from Task Rabbit offering many services - even if they can’t do the job you are trying to arrange! Buyer beware.",0,1

The customer service agent called and called but the driver didn’t answer, so she left a voicemail and assured me this wouldn’t be an issue. Later in the day, I receive a voicemail (no call, just voicemail) that I missed my allotted (4-hour long) appointment time and that they would need to reschedule and I would need to re-pay the delivering fee. They later informed me that drivers can only deliver to the address registered, so why didn’t the customer service agent I spent over a half hour on the phone with that morning inform me of that policy? They also only deliver to my area on Thursday’s, which meant we would have to wait another week for our furniture. End of story, I received a refund and will just get my furniture elsewhere.

To get it repaired one needs to go through IKEA and than through their subcontractors. Subcontractor cannot be contacted once they leave your home. They came 3 times now to fix and failed every time. Finally it was replaced and broke again after 5 days. Customer experience of dealing with IKEA and their subcontractors has been terrible. We still don’t have the working dishwasher and all the kitchen elements where the machine was fitted are not as they used to be (ie doors cannot be closed , one kitchen door is broken as a result of removal and installation of a new appliance). All in all , terrible customer experience which is really disappointing as we spent so much money with IKEA over so many years. we asked for a store credit (no amount specified) as a matter of showing respect to us as loyal customers who suffered tremendous inconvenience as a result of this especially as we have a newborn so without working kitchen it has bee really challenging. IKEA did Bit want to hear about that. Therefore we need to raise awareness about poor products and poor customer service and overall experience with IKEA. Good news is there is a lot more choice on the market at affordable prices so we have a lot more options than IKEA. We advise against IKEA kitchens.",0,1
IKEA,Absolutely useless,"Absolutely useless. I applied for an Ikea credit card on the evening, and may I say, late evening of Thursday 3 - 7 - 19. I was excited and I already had in mind what I wanted to buy and had been looking it up on their website.The next day, I was then told some 18 hours later that I was supposed to of used my card that I very evening to have gotten my $25 off my first purchase, 'even though I had no physical card in my hand.'So within those few hours before midnight on that Thursday evening I should have used this card to have gotten $25 off my first purchase. One of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard of in my whole life, and so poorly explained on the credit card application. When I called the following day some 18 hours later I was told by 2 Ikea employees, (Ben being the second,) that I could never get this $25 again to use. I cancelled the credit card instantly via Ben. I've already posted a blog about my experience on Facebook about this and I will be filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau, anywhere that has reviews on Ikea and also consumer affairs. People need to understand how ridiculous Ikea is and the bank that supports them.UPDATE:As time went on a complaint was filed with the Washington DC branch of the Better Business Bureau. Richard S in the corporate office at IKEA promised to send an e-card with $25 on it to an email address that I've used for almost 22 years and I check daily. Never once did these number ever appear in my spam folder or my inbox. Then my other email address was given to him which I've had for 14 years and check mane times daily. Once again no $25 numbers ever appeared. Finally Christine called from Ikea's Corporate office and left a message on my voicemail after I had talked to this particular lady the day before. At the time of this writing she said in a voice mail which was 17 days ago now, that a physical card would be mailed to me and would arrive in 7 to 10 days. Of course, no card has ever arrivedI've recently filed a complaint with the attorney General of Washington DC and Mrs Carter there has forwarded my complaint to the appropriate attorney General of the state that the Ikea is in. I've come across a few other companies that are this awful with their constant lies about sending things to the customer. Let's be honest here, if Ikea were true to their word they would have spent a few extra cents and had this so called physical card sent to me with a tracking number. Even more simple, they would have called me on the phone and just given me the numbers.I'm NOT surprised in the slightest that this company has a got a 1star review.",0,1

IKEA,I have had an appalling,"I have had an appalling, unacceptable service with Ikea. I purchased some kitchen units on 17th April 2019 (Order ID 1027803844) and they were delivered on Good Friday however there was one item missing - a galvanised suspension rail to hang the kitchen units on the wheel which is a vital component.After eventually finding the telephone number for Customer Services I got through to a lady called Cheryl and I was asked if I minded holding while she contacted the driver. On coming back to me I was told the driver had a look on his truck but could not find anything but would have a more thorough look at their next delivery and if they found it drop it around to me. In the meantime she said she would place an order for it and get it out to me asap, however, because of the Easter weekend could not get it delivered to me until Tuesday morning, this mucked up my planned DIY weekend.On 22nd April (Easter Monday) I just had a gut feeling that something was going to go wrong with my delivery today as this is not the first time I have had a bad experience with IKEA, and sure enough I was right. I was told by a lady called Ketsya there had been a system error and the order had been blocked, and that they now would not be able to get this to me until Wednesday morning. I demanded to speak to a Supervisor and after 15-20 minutes arguing I was eventually put through to the floor supervisor Kelly who I proceeded to complain to. All she could do was offer me apologies and say that she would send ne a £20.00 gift voucher, which I believe is rubbing salt into the wounds as it just giving me a voucher to plough funds back into their company. I was assured by her and her colleague that I would definitely receive my missing item on Wednesday 24th April between 7:00am-1:00pm.I was sent an acknowledgement email confirming this and given a new Order ID - 1027110192. I have taken more time off work to receive the delivery.My tale of woe does not end there - At 7:58 this evening (23rd April 2019) I got an email with the new invoice and saying that the delivery date is 25th April (Thursday) - As you can imagine I have had no other notice to say the date has changed and was extremely angry.Again I got on to Customer Services and spoke to an advisor who said there was nothing they could do. I demanded to speak to a Manager and eventually after much reluctance was put through to a Mr Paul Taylor - Again I proceeded to complain, and he apologised but said he could not do anything or get the item to me tomorrow, I again said this was unacceptable and although it may seem petty that it was for a strip of metal that hangs the kitchen units, firstly it was an essential item and secondly I keep getting promised that I am going to receive it and it never happens. He said he was just going to see if there was anything he could do and put me on hold. On coming back to me, he then proceeded to say that the only way I could get it earlier is if I went to Croydon store and picked it up - I explained that this was not good enough and that as a Manager he should be doing everything he can to get the item to me tomorrow even if it means sending the strip in an estate cab or on a van from the store. The Croydon store is a 30 minute drive from Bromley South. I have now told him that I either want him or someone on his behalf to get in touch with Croydon and arrange for a delivery of my missing item by tomorrow and if this cannot be done I want to know why but I expect a call back from both his department and Croydon Store and if I do not receive this call by 11:00am tomorrow will not only be taking it up with the British Head Office but will be writing to the CEO in Sweden Mr Jesper Brodin . I wonder what his department would have to say about how the UK Customers are treated.My advice to everybody reading this - Go to B&Q or Homebase - I wish I had doneMark Potter",0,1

IKEA,"IKEA ""missing assembly"" unfair charge","I will omit the details that it was difficult enough to negotiate with the IKEA service. Was everything described by other users - not possible to reach by phone, ignoring emails, cutting calls, etc. Finally, the kitchen assembly was scheduled for me on March 15th. Despite the fact that on the 15th I needed to be in the office, I asked for a leave to wait for the kitchen assambling. The time in the letter was indicated from 7 am to 9 pm, so I woke up at 7 am and began to wait. I was sitting literally next to the door, checked the doorbell in advance. The fact that I was at home can be checked with CCTV cameras. Unfortunately, after waiting for a whole day, noone came. In the evening, I went downstairs to check my mailbox I was very surprised to see the letter that they were coming, but they did not find me at home! This is an absolute lie. The saddest thing is that IKEA invoiced me for 75% of the assembly (371 euros without VAT), which I have to pay before April 15th. This is a cheating and fraud. Obviously, this is an established IKEA service scheme, to receive money without providing services: the situation repeated afterwards,with the next assambling service. On the day of delivery I got a call from the contact center by phone and and they said that the assembly workers could not reach me. I said a second, I will now go down and open the door. And a minute later a miracle happened - the workers finally managed to press the doorbell! And, finally, everything worked, I opened them and I did not have to go down. It is very strange, why they could not press the doorbell before someone called me from the contact center? I want to clarify that the house where I live is absolutely new, everything is in excellent condition and perfectly works. And on the dorbell downstairs my surname is written, as well as on the doorbell on my floor. Going to protect my rights - want to withstand this conscienceless scheme.",0,1

My dad was there to sign for the order on March 21, but the delivery driver dropped off someone else’s order and not mine. I contacted IKEA and the customer service rep told me they would have someone pick it up and drop off the right order. She asked if I wanted to change the address for delivery and I said yes, change it to my apartment. So I wait a few days and receive a call it’s going to be delivered March 25. Then on March 25, I get a text from the delivery driver with a picture of the furniture dropped off at the original address, not the one I had changed it to. I went over to my parents address to pick it up, and only 3 of the 4 boxes were there. When I spoke to the delivery driver, they said they were only given 3 boxes from Ikea in round rock. But clearly on each box it says 2 of 4, 3 of 4, and 4 of 4. I didn’t get box 1 of 4. The delivery driver said he would still come to my apartment to pick up the ORIGINAL wrong persons furniture from the very first drop off, which he did. I called IKEA to tell them I am missing box 1 of 4, plus explained all of the problems I have had with this delivery, and the lady said they would be shipping me an entirely new dresser with all 4 parts. I told her I only needed box 1 of 4 but she insisted they resend everything, and the delivery driver would pick up the other 3 boxes when they drop the 4 boxes off. She gave me the delivery fee back, but when I asked for a manager or supervisor to explain this and get some sort of discount or anything really for all of the trouble, she said the manager would only give the delivery fee back. So I said okay and verified with her the dresser would be coming to my APARTMENT address. She said yes and they would call me when it’s being delivered. Now it is April 1 and I am still waiting for the dresser and have not received one call saying it will be delivered soon. This has been such a terrible experience. I won’t be buying from IKEA again and highly recommend not using their delivery services simply based on my own experience. When I spoke to customer service the second time, the lady was nice but made it seem like errors are quite common. If I don’t get the dresser by this Friday I will be asking for a refund and will take it as a lesson to simply never order from there again.

IKEA,IKEA PLATSA,"IKEA PLATSA I recently purchased a wardrobe combination in the PLATSA range. The first frame to be assembled (80 cm) was faulty. The hardboard back would not slide to the top and frustratingly became jammed, would not move forward or backwards, about 3 inches from the top. In our effort to remove it it broke. Ikea replaced this a few days later at no extra cost, the replacement frame and other 80 cm frame were easy to assemble. However the exact same thing happened with the 60 cm frame. The only solution offered is that I disassemble the second faulty product and get another exchange. So two out of four faulty units. Not impressed. I have guests this weekend, have run out of time and a spare room full of half assembled wardrobes, and a bed piled high with its the future contents. I would be wary of this product",0,2

Lastly, they'll try to wiggle away with not refunding you a service fee for providing partially-done service, like how you'd pay an electrician or plumber to drive out to your house, look around, but not fix what needs to be fixed.. the logic. Add to it the fact that their general service line is always busy with no-waiting and their very NOT customer-first attitude, you have nothing but one of the worst company to buy from here.",0,1

IKEA,Great Chest of Drawers,"Can't believe the negative reviews.Found a chest of drawers I liked and which had the required dimensions and ordered it (only available online, though there's no way I'd have gone into a store to pick it up - too many members of the public desperate to leave negative reviews to contend with).It came exactly on time, with lots of text messages to say when.Assembly was a doddle. Discovered ONE screw missing at the end (should have been 24, but there were 23). Contacted IKEA via webchat, and they arranged to send out a spare immediately (7 day delivery time).They sent 10 spare screws a few days later.Cabinet looks nice, is strong, and the drawers are silky-smooth with loads of space.The simple moral to be gleaned from many of the negative reviews is that if you can't assemble flatpack, don't buy it in the first place.",0,5

I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars at Ikea, their return policy is horrendous. They seem almost intentionally drastically understaffed, there's always a huge wait, they even have a number system if that tells you anything about how long the wait is. I've only tried to return a single item in my entire consumer live at Ikea, a $299 carpet that had a tiny hardened spot probably one centimeter big that they claimed was a paint stain, the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, it was the exact same color as the carpet fabric was probably there from the time that I purchased it.

IKEA,IKEA Bucharest fails on paying back the money they owe their customers,Good evening. I am struggling to get my money back in my account since 1st November 2018. I have ordered some products from IKEA Bucharest for my mother in Romania. I have paid using a credit card and as I didn't receive the payment confirmation I have paid with my debit card too. I wasn't aware that I have paid twice. I have acknowledged the double payment after few days after checking my account. I had to cancel the order as one item wasn't in store. Only one payment was returned in my account and I struggle since then with the Romanian Customer Service. I have claimed the reimbursement of the second payment . The last conversation and email I had with them was received on the 28th of December when I was informed that the payment will be done within 14 days. I know that the 14 days of waiting are not over yet but I am not sure that they will pay me the money back as I was already told the the money were send in my account few time since I have submitted the complaint. I fell like Don Quijote fighting the wind mills. Can IKEA Bucharest answer the question: When my money will be in my account?,0,1
IKEA,Put off IKEA forever.,"Put off IKEA forever.Purchased an £850 Pax wardrobe with sliding doors. We had no problem putting the unit together, but the trying to hang the doors was a nightmare. There were some grommets that kept falling off, we had to take the doors off and remove the shoe racks to put them back on. They wouldn't stay on, the door was screeching and one of the doors got scratched. We called IKEA, they sent ecomaster out. They guy came and said it was a manufacturing fault, he didn't even attempt to put the grommets back or stop the door from screeching, he said that he would recommend a replacement door and IKEA would be in touch. Two weeks later I contacted IKEA only to find out that ecomaster logged it as a customer fault, he said that we didn't put it together properly and he noted that both doors were on the same track. (that's not even possible, they are sliding doors, the rail isn't long enough to have both doors on the same track) complete lie! So after much fuss IKEA agreed to send ecomaster out again, this guy asked us for some felt strips, which were not in the box, he said this is why the door got scratched. Again he's going to refer this back to IKEA, and again I wait to hear from IKEA and ended up calling them. They again told me that the case was closed, ecomaster logged it as a customer fault, completely opposite to what he told us. Fortunately this time we recorded the whole visit. I'll be contacting trading standards. I will never shop at IKEA again, in fact I purchased a number of things for this room, and I returned all of it. There are plenty of other places that sell similar and better products.",0,1

We dismantled them immediately for safety reasons.I contacted customer care who wanted us to rebuild them for inspection at my house. I refused & said they were more than welcome to build them if they wanted to look at them. They refused & after much back and forth, it was agreed that if I returned them to my nearest store, over an hour away, they would be refunded or replaced.Drove 50 odd miles to Warrington, only to be told that they weren't going to do as promised, but instead wanted to rebuild the beds first. We had to leave them there & they would let us know the next step. This was Monday. I finally got a call back THURSDAY (after leaving at least 10 messages) telling me the beds aren't faulty. The ray of sunshine on the phone obviously watched Liitle Britain ""computer says no"" sketches to pick up tips on how to annoy customers. She refused point blank to give me the name of the head of customer service, the store manager & was basically as rude as she could get away with. I got straight off the phone, Googled the CEO of IKEA to get an email address. Within 5 minutes, an email was winging its way to Javier Quinones. Less than 12 hours later I had a response & after a couple of emails exchanged over the course of the day, a refund was offered & accepted.Without a doubt the most inept & frustrating customer service experience in my entire life. I would suggest going straight to Javier Quinones, if he gets enough complaints, he'll realise how truly awful some of his staff are.",0,1

My family and I waited for three hours. Beyond ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I finally couldn't take it anymore so I went up to the desk and asked what is the hold-up because our number was in the ""red zone"" for all this time. The rep. told me that our merchandise requires a forklift so that's why it's taking so long and to give them another 15 minutes. 15 minutes turned into 45 and still nothing.

Then I was told it was all ok. Then I get an email from Ikea, I must contact them immediately.

IKEA,IKEA: Southampton,"What! IKEA's average rating is a one. That's strange.IKEA is one of the best constructed stores on the plant. The neatness they have to withstand for their furniture shop to keep running is incredible. If IKEA would not have any order then the shop would never exist.Firstly, their quality is sublime..... cannot really put it into words. Anything you buy from IKEA will never break. Desks, chairs, pillow cases whatever..... they are all fantastic. Secondly, their prices which in my opinion are overpriced. But then again IKEA make up for that with the quality and extraordinary quality. £600 for a 2 seat chair is not ideal to be honest and you could probably get a sofa at a 'sofa specialist' for half the price. Saying that though IKEA quality is superb.Thirdly, their co-ordination is excellent and once you have gone to the store four or five times you will fully understand it. Little tip for everyone who goes to IKEA in Southampton: park on the top floor as the entrance is on the top floor. So the lower you park, the more time you have to waste on a escalator. Showrooms and the look at items in a full glimpse are on the first floors and then all the items in wooden packaging are at the bottom which you can pick up and pay.Fourthly, their food is not too shabby either. For a company which is Swedish which specialises in DIY Furniture their food is pretty good. They sell relatively Swedish food (of course). Most of their meals contain meats (meatballs as well as hot dogs). It's not bad and its relatively cheap.Sublime this shop..... really is!",0,5

I did not receive a notification nor any kind of heads up. THIS PROCESS REPEATED 3 TIMES.

After two days i was then told that one of item i ordered is not available and they cancelled my order.It resulted in waste of my time and my money being tied up as the refund process takes 1-3 weeks.The problem is that the IKEA website is still showing items i ordered available online but in reality those items are not in stock and customers only get to know this after they have made the payment resulting in waste of customer's time and their money being tied up.The inventory management of IKEA is sub standard and online purchase from IKEA is a total waste of time.,0,1

On contacting IKEA (with a 15 min wait on the phone) they said the the order had not gone through processing despite the website still saying the original delivery date. The order was cancelled and reordered over the phone but again the delivery date passed. I contacted IKEA again and was told that due to high volume of orders it would not now be delivered until nine days later. Not taking the chance I cancelled the order and will go for alternatives via Amazon. I never understand how a company like IKEA can do mail order/online sales so badly and they really need to get a tie in with someone like Amazon and get delivery with 'Prime' for next day delivery (at least on the smaller items).",0,1
IKEA,Non existent customer service - or a constant 30 min wait on the phone.,"So far my experience of IKEA customer service is about as bad as it gets! Part of my order wasn't delivered a week ago (Order ID: 1003656942) - the van driver couldn't care less. I called for a replacement and that was due for delivery. Unfortunately it seems the lady put the wrong details on the paperwork (from a previous delivery to the same address) instead of using the details from my original order - so this never arrived either. My email complaint bounced - they seem to only have a call centre with a constant 30 minute wait! No other way to get in touch. At this rate it'll be easier to go to a store, but I have no trust that they'll even help because I placed the order online.... TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. do not consider buying from IKEA online.",0,1

Ikea don't even tell you it's not arriving or that they don't have stock anymore (bizzarely) or that it's on hold?!?

IKEA,"""Computer Says No""","Having purchased wardrobes for one bedroom had them delivered and a damaged item replaced, which the delivery driver noticed when dropping off and experienced a tremendous fitting service I was ready to use the whole products and services again for a second bedroom. Just an observation to start, when a company buries its customer service telephone number deep in its website the company is not really concerned about customer service. Also you really find out the approach of an organisation to customer service when something goes wrong. Having purchased the wardrobes and them being delivered I noticed there was another Pax Wardrobe which had been left incorrectly. By the way I live in a small flat and two Pax wardrobe boxes take up a lot of space and cause considerable inconvenience. After 48 hours I had not heard from IKEA regarding their Pax wardrobe I eventually found their telephone number and called them. My expectation would be that we would simply agree a date and time for pick and that would be it. The response from the operator was abysmal, the tone, the amount of information requested, the lack of any apology and the inability to offer a date and time when the wardrobe could be collected. Absolutely appalling. I had to put the phone down. All I heard was a 10.00am to 4.00pm window and an hour slot from another company. I paid my money to IKEA I am an IKEA customer, IKEA should resole the huge problem of an unwanted Pax Wardrobe. Having put the phone down. I emailed IKEA giving them 3 dates when it would be convenient from my standpoint to collect the wardrobe. I got a response in over 24 hours, "" Unfortunately we cannot give a smaller timeslot than 10am - 4pm as this is set by the delivery company. We also use an automated routing system which plans our routes based on how much stock we have to deliver and where - we cannot override this"". So I am being told a human being cannot override a computer system. I am not bothered about IKEA's inflexible approach and their deliveries, I have a wardrobe of theirs which I have stored for nearly 5 days and is very inconvenient and will be even more so tomorrow when the fitters come to install my wardrobe. My questions to readers is; am being unreasonable to expect a slot from IKEA which means I am not sitting waiting 10.00am to 4.00pm for some other organisation to contact me. Am I an IKEA customer or have I missed something. Please beware folks, a good product does not equal a good customer service.",0,1

This review is not against the shop or products, its against the customer service and delivery. We spent over £600 on wardobes and a chest of drawers, we have just had to arrange our 5th delivery attempt. Reasons for this have been that the delivery company lied about attempting to deliver, then the goods were damaged, then we have had two cases of not all the items being in the van so we are still waiting on two items. I have spent hours on the phone to customer service where one guy hung up on me after explaining the issues in detail, having to recall and re-explain...I am heavily pregnant and we are desperatly trying to get our house ready for the babies arrival, we have had no apology other than 4 lots of £30 'waste of day' compensation - which is not good enough...

Arranged for delivery of whole new item and return of the now faulty one at the same time. Later that day on assembling a desk that had to be purchased in two parts, I saw that we'd picked up one in the wrong colour.Back on the phone and once again great service and arranged for correct colour unit to be delivered/wrong one returned. No charge for either. Both the deliveries within 3 days of phone call. Even though both instances were our mistakes, and were purchased in store (and generally would need to be returned to store) they really went above and beyond to help. Actually, best customer service I've received from a large company in a long time.",0,5

I think it would be decent that IKEA give me a really good compensation for this crazy delay and the poor customer service.IKEA, SAT 12:50Good news!

You should be able to sort this out here and now.IKEA, SAT 15:11There, you'll be able to fill a complain form that will be checked by the managers of customer service. After that, you will receive a letter with the answer. Because it has to be signed, we cannot manage it by this way.Me, SAT 16:32What do you mean? Because it has to be signed. That’s just to make it difficult for us customers. IKEA knows perfectly well what has happened.

In relation to your query, we inform you that in order to file an official complaint it is necessary to go to the Customer Service desk at your nearest IKEA store: A complaint is an official document that must be written and signed by the customer, so it is not possible to carry out this type of action by telephone or through our social media. Thank you.Me, SUN 12:18I don't agree.YOU say that a complaint has to be signed at the Customer Service desk in an IKEA store. All decent companies realize when they have caused an unreasonable amount of inconveniance to a customer (check your logs if you want).Waiting for deliveries (that did not happened) in the house for 5 times, 4 hours each time. 20 hours waistedSpend approximately 3 hours in phone with IKEA.Final delivery, 50 days after the promised 6 weeks delivery time.Therefore, you should offer a compensation without me asking for it.Instead you say to me: Get in your car, drive 50 minutes, 62 km. Go to Customer Service desk and write a complaint, no idea about waiting time, so I put 20 minutes (to little). Drive back, same time and distance.

IKEA,Appalling Customer Service,"I have to say that customer service for something on line is appalling at the least! We have been very good customers of yours over years and this might be the final straw. I ordered something that had to be delivered down to us in the Southwest, making arrangements and waiting the time for the delivery down here. Only to find when it was delivered that an item the Main item was omitted. After waiting on line for over a half hour it was told to me that the order for the Ivar piece #892-482-05 I had ordered your fulfilment department had made a mistake on and deleted the order and credited my card back! NO messages to this until I called you! The item was NOT out of stock and still is IN stock! But the only solution was to inconvenience me more by issuing me a gift card for the £35 additional delivery fee with a delay of up to 10 days before the card would arrive before I could again make arrangements to order it and then set up for another delivery down here! In this day and age you would think you could take the order and omit the delivery charge and I would have been with the item by now. But no such luck. Chris who I just spoke to in your after order department could not have been less helpful! Only giving me the normal guidelines to what has already been told to me. I am still waiting this gift card and most likely will chuck it in the bin! Having a family card and valued customers does not seem to reign in with IKEA! Very unsatisfactory and would suggest you take a look at Trust Pilot to see how many Thousands say the same thing! Over all a 1 star rating!",0,1

IKEA,Huge Ikea fan,"After seeing all the bad reviews, I figured I'd share my opinion, I only ever go to the shop to buy, I never opt for delivery, but I've rarely had a problem buying in store. The stock check is for the most part correct, although the 'it may be in store' status means it probably isn't.The items are inexpensive, great quality and if you're not a complete idiot they're easy to install.I use Ikea 90% of the time for myself, I've decked out several apartments in Ikea gear, I'm a high end interior designer who specs luxury homes but I always trust ikea to sort my place out!",0,5

After 2 weeks they just didn’t deliver in the 8-12 interval that they said they would and they called me at 14:50 to tell me my order has been canceled. This is just super frustrating.

It takes an average of 10 minutes to get through to the customer service agent, who doesn't think twice about just dropping the call. Agents named Amouna and Faiza - they were just ineffective and unhelpful. I understand there can be logistics issues, but a responsible business will atleast keep the customer in the loop!

IKEA,IKEA is the home of intelligence,"I have been a huge Scandi Modernist when it comes to home shopping. I love IKEA for its fantastic ideas, minimalistic designs and economical pricing. For furniture and home décor which is inherent to change over time, I find IKEA a cool and creative place to buy things to make your home beautiful and a hub of creativity. My local store is GATESHEAD and I have received fantastic service that's includes knowledge from staff, ideas, and at the checkouts. I love their restaurant because we can spend time with kids during shopping and it is not expensive either. I have ordered for home delivery and in all fairness, the delivery is expensive which is only downside about IKEA but has been okay and on time. I bundled up a big order so it was economical as compared to other providers. We recently bought a sofa bed which was not expensive (£350) with storage and cushions and its the best thing I have had lately compared to a leather sofa from Barker and Stonehouse which costed over £2000 and never came with fire tags and I had to pay £20 to remove it because no one would buy or take in for charity without the tags plus was so uncomfortable apart from looking slick. Some of the kitchenware in IKEA is so creative especially for space saving in your house. I visit IKEA for their ideas more than anything. In this age of trends, IKEA is my go to place.",0,5

Since the package was NOT delivered, I contacted The Delivery Company again and the attendant told me that the driver truck was sick, they don't have anyone available to deliver the package and there isn't an estimated date to be delivered.

I spent over 10 hours on the phone with them in total, and at some point, they started giving other excuses such as not having products in stock. By the end, my order has been postponed to be delivered about a month after the original date. When I decided to cancel, I had to stay on the line for 3 hours while they transferred me and made me wait and wait. AWFUL experience that left me with no furniture in my new apartment for over a month.",0,1
IKEA,By far the worst shopping experience I've had,"EVERY step of the way has had issues, from ongoing delayed deliveries, missing items, lack of updates from IKEA on delays and missing items, difficulty in reaching customer service to enquire on said delays/items, inability of staff to properly follow through with pick-ups/refunds therefore resulting in delayed pick-ups and refunds, missing parts or parts that were not finished being cut, etc. Like others, I have had to waste hours, days and much energy waiting for deliveries that never showed up, putting aside tasks I could have completed had the schedule been adhered to or updates on a modified schedule at least been provided to me. I am overdue compensation for this trouble. Like others, I'll be justifiably reporting IKEA to the BBB and FTC and publishing bad reviews wherever I can. The first and last time I'll be shopping at IKEA. And I hope IKEA soon gets what it deserves: to be shut down.",0,1

This is despite a service agent being very closeby the self service desk. There was also no prompts by the machine to alert the service agent. This is shocking and I really feel ikea should monitor who is purchasing items that could, in the wrong hand be used for other purposes.",0,2
IKEA,Generally okay.,"This year is the first time I've ever bought anything from ikea. I've had three deliveries in total this year and they've been generally problem free. The price for delivery is extortionate though at £35 for heavy items but delivery is fairly straightforward. They give you a slot and they'll take your items to your room of your choice. The furniture is good quality and I've been quite impressed with them. The only slight problem I had was with Parcelforce who were supposed to deliver a small parcel. The day they were supposed to come, I heard nothing all day. Tried making contact with ikea which seemed impossible as their email system was down and I didn't fancy spending 20 minutes in a call queue. In the end, their twitter page eventually told me they were having problems with parcel force. I eventually got the parcel 4 days later. Still, it would have been nice to have been told this information.",0,4

IKEA,I wish I had read these reviews....,I wish I had read these reviews or even googled 'Ikea customer service' and then I would NEVER have placed an order with Ikea. We placed an order and both took the day off work as we had over 50 items arriving. We had booked in for the taskrabbit assembly too. The day came and we had no contact within our 11am-3pm slot so called customer services. After listening to Abba for 30 mins we got through to Cheryl and she said it will come today... there have been issues but don't worry yours isn't affected. What a total lie. 8pm and nothing so called back and she said they have to re-order. We said as they have wasted our day (plus cancelled hospital appointments) that we want a Saturday delivery. I have just had a text to say it's coming on a Wednesday. Lost the energy to argue and will have to take ANOTHER day off work because Ikea are so incompetent. How they are still allowed to trade is beyond me. I just want my furniture and decent human beings to deal with- is that too much to ask for?,0,1
IKEA,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"On Saturday the 08th of September of 2018, I bought a wardrobe (model: BRIMNES wardrobe/3drs 117x190 oak effect) and booked also the delivery service (£35) to get it delivered to my place one week later on Friday the 14th of September.I was told I would get it between 7 and 11am; since I had to work, I asked a friend of mine to stay and wait for the parcel as it wouldn’t be later than 11am, so she had time enough to go to her appointments. At around 10:30am I received a call from the driver saying that they were literally 10 meters away from my place but they couldn’t find my flat. Even though I have never experienced this situation before because all the deliveries always arrive without any issues, I did explained him what the street was and gave him enough indications to find my place. Without giving me a chance to explain that I had someone waiting for him, he did hang up the phone and he wouldn’t pick up the phone again at all. My friend stayed until 2:30pm and nobody came; she missed one of her appointments. We both were trying to reach the driver but he wouldn’t answer; he finally did, saying to her that they were coming back on a smaller van, even though there’s no need as my street is big enough, also I live just next to the corner, the could have parked there and walk the 2 meters between the corner and my door; my friend wouldn’t have mind go and help them to bring the boxes up. I went to the IKEA contact page on the website where I did found an email, the same that appears on the confirmation email when I bought the wardrobe, as a “customer service” channel. I did tried to send an email and the response I got (and this happened twice) was: “This mailbox does not accept direct emails, so your email has been removed.” (see screenshot attached); so, what is the purpose of this email?, is it just a placeholder so the customers think you actually offer a service?.I tried also the live chat, but I had to refresh the page several times until it would appears and disappears suddenly, I’ve managed to connect only twice, even though I’ve tried all day. The first time it was at around 12 the person in the chat told me they were 30 min away; I had my friend waiting for another hour and they never came; so he lied to me, he had no idea where the drivers were and he promised me they were just around the corner. After an hour of waiting, I did tried to contact someone again, through email. (I got the same response than before), through phone (never a response) and through the chat, which again appeared and disappeared constantly. I finally managed to talk to someone on the chat for the second time, he told me again that they were very close, I did tell him the situation, he told me again that they were “on the drop”, another one lying to me. He finally said that he could only follow the track, so they never talked to the drivers, they had no idea, and they were only trying to calm me down so I wouldn’t carry on complaining.It wasn’t until almost 5pm that I finally managed to get an answer from the driver, he said they were coming during the evening or first thing on Saturday morning and that he will call me back to let me know. Friday evening passed, not a single call, text message or email. Saturday morning came, same thing. When I went to check my “delivery status” it said: “we couldn’t deliver your parcel, for more information please contact us”. How come it has to be me who contact you if you weren’t the ones who didn’t deliver the parcel the day you had to. I did pay £35 extra to get it delivered at my door on Friday and it never happened, and I am the one who has to contact you; and how?, the email doesn’t work, you never answer the phone and the live chat barely works. Completely unacceptable. If you are not able to deliver the parcel as you promised, you are the ones who have to contact the client, let them know the issues and offer a new solution; instead, I had to spend at least 20 min on the phone on just waiting until someone could “help” me. The only solution was waiting until the EARLIEST delivery date which is Thursday the 20th September, almost a week later than what I needed it. I had to ask for a new delivery date, how come you didn’t put me on the list for next delivery?. I have all my clothes and belongings all over the floor in my room since Friday. I had to ask for the day off to be at home when it gets finally delivered because they gave me a very specific time, first, between 9am and 3pm, and finally yesterday, between 11am and 3pm. Asking for the day off means I don’t get paid for this day; I can’t work from home and I have to spend almost all day at home just waiting. My friend lost all her day on Friday last week, and I will lose mine and my money tomorrow. On top of all this, I booked a furniture assembly for last Sunday in the morning (through IKEA website with TaskRabbit), I had to cancel it and start all over again. They are coming tomorrow at 4pm and I really hope my wardrobe is been delivered by then. If I knew all this would happen, I would probably go to IKEA and take a taxi cab with me. Probably, it would be cheaper and, obviously, faster. But I did trust in your services and the disappointment was massive. The only way I found to get attention was posting comments on almost every single picture on Facebook, as Twitter wouldn’t work neither or any other of the channels mentioned before. I had to become an annoying person to get someone to talk to me.",0,1

IKEA,So I buy the Melltrop table,"So I buy the Melltrop table. I was hesitant because I’ve had bad experiences with IKEA assembly before, but I gave them a go. Of course, as I’m installing, the last table leg will not screw in, even a little, but was stripped in the factory. I don’t have a car, so I ride my BIKE 50 minutes to IKEA for one thing: a new table leg. If I was rich, I wouldn’t be buying 25$ tables, and riding this many miles for a leg, would I? No, I am poor, and cannot afford the time or the table but I ride out anyway, determined to decorate my crappy Portland apartment. Upon arrival I am told they can help me, great! A nice blonde girl then asks me if all 4 table legs are the same. I have 0 idea, I told her I don’t know. THE TINIEST bit of product knowledge THIS EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE could have saved me. Me, being very intelligent but underprivileged, think quick to say: hey, here is the stripped leg. I carried it all the way here so YOU CAN COMPARE IT NOW. Do you think they followed through with the correct leg? OF COURSE NOT? Why be even a little intelligent and listen to me when you can be a stupid IKEA employee? She tells me to wait 20 minutes, takes my phone number to call me, and I leave. 45 minutes later: NO PHONE CALL. I decide to walk back in.Panic stricken, the girl tells me she has my leg. I get back to my apartment: still my table lays on the floor because THIS IS THE WRONG LEG. I don’t have a car, the level of inconvenience caused me by IKEA, specifically it’s product-unaware employees, is unforgivable. So many chances I’ve given Ikea. As long as I live, I will never, ever, buy IKEA furniture. I am going to burn that table to the ground someday, just because I dislike IKEA that much. I have a table I paid for, that is 100% unusable, even after 2 hours of biking and 45 minutes of waiting. So, so, so displeased. I will be posting this review everywhere possible.

We waited until afternoon, had to cancel our other appointment in the afternoon. Until the end of day, 9pm, we didnot see our furniture nor anybody call us. During the time, we called both the delivery company and ikea. No answer from both company. The delivery company has an answer machine but never return my call. Ikea simple hang up the phone with message saying they are too busy to answer. (I have call ikea many times after that, 9 out of 10 time I was hang up after the brief ""too busy"" message. I think they should at least give me option to on hold or be called back.)Anyway, after finally get in touch with the delivery company and ikea. They offer different story each time, and always blame the other company.The bottom line is, they had contact me 2 days prior delivery. If they could not put items together at warehouse in time, they should contact me. The worst case, the delivery company and IKEA should call me on the scheduled delivery day when they find out they could not do delivery that day. They should also fix the answering service. In this time of age, people complain being talking to computer, being hold for too long. IKEA does not give these options, they simply hang up.After search on Internet, I found I am not the only one.

IKEA,Unacceptably poor customer “service”,"Had I known the delivery company IKEA works with and it’s telephone support network was so sub-par, I would have saved myself the 4 hours I spent waiting for my order today and simply gone to the store. After not receiving any update on my order past my due delivery time, I called IKEA customer service only to be informed that my item had not been collected that morning. If that was the case, it would have been really considerate had someone contacted me to let me know rather than leaving me to wait all day and requiring me to call up to find out where my items were. Sandy, the customer service representative I called then assured me my items would be delivered on Monday evening and I would be able to receive a shipping refund if I stayed on the line. Of course, as soon as she tried to transfer me the call dropped so I spent a further 50 minutes on hold trying to reach a new representative only to be told it wasn’t IKEA’s responsibility but the shipping company and I would have to reschedule directly with them. I’m absolutely disgusted with the level of customer service I have received from the company and the company IKEA uses to ship your products. As far as I am concerned, I paid IKEA for my order and my shipping, therefore it is IKEA’s responsibility to deliver my order in full at the scheduled time and if not, IKEA should have let me know instead of wasting my day. It’s not long till my baby is due, the furniture I ordered was for the nursery and I’m supposed to be having friends around tomorrow to help me set up everything and have fun getting ready for the arrival of my baby. I am so upset and disappointed that I have to cancel this due to IKEAs incompetence. The items I ordered from Target and Walmart on the very same day arrived over a week ago...and the shipping was free. This is absolutely the last time I ever order anything from IKEA online and the experience has left me feeling so let down I honestly don’t think I ever want to give any money to this store again. As a European, myself and my family have always used IKEA furnishings for our homes, and my husband has furnished several rental properties with IKEA products but in the future I think I’ll be relying on more reliable businesses who can actually follow through with a promise once taking my money.",0,1

After 90 minutes on hold to speak to your call staff, all I've been informed of is that IKEA don't pack the trucks so it's not really your fault and that some pieces of the bed arrived therefore the delivery was a success. I'm more preoccupied with the failure of the parts that never arrived than the success of those that did.",0,1
IKEA,very poor service from online order…,very poor service from online order took time off wasted 6 hours waiting for delivery which did not arrive. Have not received any news on when delivery is now arriving. Nightmare to contact once you have purchased. Tried calling 4 times waiting up to 30 min with no luck. Disgraceful customer service. Before you purchase anything try to contact their customer services see how easy they are to contact. Charge £35 for delivery waste a day waiting and still no idea when it will arrive.,0,1

How can I assist you?11:34:03 am jared lewis: i have purchased an Alex desk on saturday from your cardiff store. When it has been assembled the dwell holes in the top of the desk were not drilled deep enough by you the manufacturer and have therefore caused 4 dents in the top surface of the desk. i live 100 miles away from cardiff and am not prepared to drive all the way to cardiff to return the item. i can however send you a photograph and a copy of the receipt via email.11:35:08 am Kayleigh: I am sorry to hear this. Do you have the article number for the item please11:35:42 am jared lewis: yes its : 902.607.1011:36:20 am Kayleigh: Thank you. Is it just a replacement top panel that is required?11:37:06 am jared lewis: no as i was glueing it together as it was put together. so it will not just detach which is a shame.11:38:32 am Kayleigh: Ok if you have glued the item then there is nothing we can do unfortunately. If you wish to return the item back to the store it would be at their discretion should they wish to assist you further11:42:06 am jared lewis: that is completely unfair. i have purchased a lot of items from ikea and always glued the dowel joints with wood glue as this is good practice for the item to stay in tact for the long term. the glue has not caused the damage. the item being manufactured faulty is the problem. I have paid on my credit card so can go down the route of claiming the money back through them if you would prefer, as i now have written evidence that you are not prepared to help.11:43:28 am Kayleigh: I do appreciate that however we do not advise for the item to be glued in any way as this voids the guarantee of the item11:43:54 am jared lewis: it does not say that on any of the instructions i received.11:44:41 am Kayleigh: It does not say to use glue, It advises of the parts that are required to assemble the items and that is not one of them.11:48:21 am jared lewis: that is irrelevant you've just told me that the guarantee is voided if i use glue. which i have not been told on the instructions. if this was on the instructions then you would have a valid point. but it is not!! Using Pva Glue for Dowelled wood joints is good practice. any carpenter will tell you that. the item is faulty. If you are not prepared to either issue a refund or send out a replacement, then i will either have to contact my credit card company as stated previously or contact traded standards. if you personally cannot help me to resolve this Kayleigh then please can you get a manager to contact me. I am not a happy customer.11:49:57 am Kayleigh: I understand your frustration and we could help you with regards to the item had you not glued this together by sending a replacement top panel. However as this has been done there is nothing more we can do. I apologise for this. As previously advised if you wish to visit your local store for assistance it would be at their discretion should they wish to assist you further however there is nothing further we can do from here.11:53:19 am jared lewis: can you please get a manger to contact me. If you think i am going to do a 200 mile round trip then i will expect to be compensated for my mileage at £0.45 a mile on top of the refund/exchange. I would like to speak to your line manager as i am not happy. you can get him/her to call me. but i will be taking this further if i am compensated for a faulty item as a customer. this was not the only item i purchased when i visited the cardiff store. so i will be arranging a refund for everything not just this item.11:54:59 am Kayleigh: If you wish to speak to a manager you will need to call us on 0203 645 0000.11:57:31 am jared lewis: I've been waiting on the phone for 25 minutes before i did this online chat!!! i don't think your customer service is good at all i think i would have spent my time better reviewing the very poor customer service i have had from ikea on the internet for every body to see how poor you are . i would like you to arrange a manger to call me please to resolve this.11:58:07 am Kayleigh: As advised I can not arrange this as you need to call us on the number above.11:59:54 am Kayleigh: Unfortunately there is nothing more we can do regardless of if you speak to someone else this is the standard process.12:00:00 pm jared lewis: im not doing that. I'm going to print our chat off put a claim in with my credit card company and put the chat online in as many forums and review sites as i can about ikeas horrendous customer service. thank you12:00:40 pm Kayleigh: Ok.

IKEA,WARNING DO NOT SHOP WITH IKEA ONLINE!,"WARNING DO NOT SHOP WITH IKEA ONLINE!Ikea takes the prize for the worst online company! I placed an order for a wardrobe to be given a delivery between 1pm and 5pm in 4 days time. The 4 days went, 5pm came, no delivery - 1 hour waiting in the queue to speak to someone, only to be told that it would be coming, here's £20 compensation. 8pm came, no delivery, another hour on the phone, only to be told that the drivers had run out of time and that I should re-schedule (too late to do today), which would more likely be in 4 days time. Cancelled order, offered £30 compensation for wasting 6 hours (+1 hour writing an email to the CEO) of my time for nothing.Shopping with Ikea online is a waste of time and effort and it leaves you feeling incredibly angry and frustrated for being such a fool for trying it. I just wish I'd checked here before attempting it. Why they waste their time offering this terrible ""service"", I have no idea. If they didn't offer it, I'd have gone into a store and I'd be happy now, and more fulfilled having done something useful in those 7 hours!",0,1

IKEA,Terrible Service,"Terrible Service I had ordered a delivery worth quite a substantial amount of money which was meant to be delivered between 7am and 11am on the 31st August. After having a missed call from the driver I rang him back later to which he told me three different stories, one stating he had attempted delivery, the second saying he could not find the house and the third saying he would ring back in ten minutes with a solution. The driver did not ring back and actively rejected my calls. I then decided to web chat with customer services. This was another terrible experience. I was made to feel as though the whole situation was my own fault. The operator used my name at the end of each sentence in a patronising tone without even asking if she could address me by my first name. When asked what I could do about my delivery she stated the driver would ring me. When I asked what to do if this doesn’t happen she simply replied “they will ring” offering me no alternative solution or support. When asked about a refund the operator said I could only have a partial refund when my goods arrived, despite not giving me any information on how to do this. The whole customer service experience online and with the delivery man was awful with no concern or care for my situation. I then waited on hold for around half an hour to the customer service phone team. I was then told at around 16:00 that the driver was only on drop 1 and that I was drop 2. I wasn’t quite sure how this was possible considering the driver told me he had already been this morning. After several phone calls to customer services at 20:30 I was told that the driver had said I had not answered phone calls and stated he left voicemails which is completely untrue. I then had to reorganise my delivery and now won’t be receiving my goods until NEXT FRIDAY! I now have to wait a whole week more for a delivery due this morning. This is absolutely unacceptable and no refund has been offered. Overall I feel the company lack communication, compassion and organisation and I hope to never experience this level of customer service again.",0,1

The following week I got another text message saying it had been delayed again for one week the following week it never turned up and I received no message so I called up and I got told they didn’t know when it would be delivered and didn’t understand why I was so unhappy I I called up again to make a complaint and this tome I was told it would be sent out immediately for delivery Thursday but yet again nothing all I got was a letter saying thanks for contacting them it has almost been 8 weeks now",0,1

Even she seemed surprised that I was still doggedly hanging on by the time she returned to my call. This morning, I've been calling since 8am as there are no online chat agents apparently, and the wait times have been between 20 and 30 minutes each time I've tried getting through.

I tried to solve the problem on Monday and a very unsympathetic Customer Service representative told me that it was my fault and I was going to be charged the $5 service fee no matter what. It's a small amount to fight for but a very good indication of the poor customer service. I understand that they don't want to store things for weeks, but this is too much in my opinion",0,1

The staff at IKEA are clearly not trained correctly. It was explained to me that they are unable to call customers to make them aware if their delivery won’t be turning because their system doesn’t flag this up! We’re in the 21st century of course it can. Most ridiculous and incompetent people work in IKEA. Very rude staff.

IKEA,Customer Services a huge letdown.,"I wish I’d thought of checking out Ikea on trustpilot before ordering online.On 14th August I ordered a coffee table online as there were none available in my local store ( Belfast).I opted to collect it myself on 20th . I arrived instore after 2pm and was told it wasn’t yet instore....no text or email to let me know. Fortunately I’d a few other things to get so headed into the store. I happened to notice that my ordered item was available instore in a colour I assumed had been discontinued. I bought it and went back to the Collection point to say I no longer wanted the one I’d ordered. The assistant said I could easily cancel it by phone or email.No matter which, of several, numbers I phoned the automated voice said there was approx.a 30 minute wait! Decided to email. No reply in next 2 days. Emailed again......still waiting for even an automated acknowledgement.I’d no option but to waste time and petrol returning to store, waiting at Collection point ( had to ask passing assistant if it would be manned soon ) and then joining queue at Returns to get a refund!Most disappointing of all was the attitude from each assistant, especially the one who had previously suggested phoning or emailing customer services. Neither was in the least sympathetic and neither even apologised on behalf of Ikea. I was polite and friendly throughout....at a loss to understand this uninterested attitude, and so unlike the helpfulness of staff throughout the store.Due to Ikea’s wide range of affordable home products I know I’ll be back......but online is now out of the question.",0,1

Tried to get help by calling 888-888- 4532 but for several days all I got was that the circuits were busy. I tried email. It took six days to get an answer that told me to do what I already tried. As I write this, I have waited for 12 minutes for an email to set up a new password. I have notified they say they will respond as soon as they can. That's not good enough for me, because last time it was 6 days on this same subject. I have better ways to spend my time and other places to spend my money. I am no longer an IKEA customer.

The process of finding out where the other furniture was, getting someone educated on the phone and getting my refund was ridiculous. The third time I ordered something from them, I was told it would be delivered the next day and had to call the next week to find out where it was. I had to call twice, because they didn't call back as promised. I am now on the phone with someone who has no answers. Ikea customer service has never been stellar but I""m not sure who is in charge these days because the process is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.

However my Daughter especially is absolutely heart broken at the subsequent follow-up order and replacement parts fiasco.From attempts to get through to customer service to shocking condition of products upon arrival.In terms of trying to contact customer services unless you have it would appear on average 45 minutes to waste hanging on the telephone just waiting for your call to be handled, furthermore taking time away from work waiting in all day for your pre-scheduled consignments to ultimately not arrive as promised on several occasions.When the goods do eventually turn up only to find the products not only completely strewn across the entire floor of the delivery vehicle but filthy dirty & badly damaged (yet still awaiting replacement parts)This I find totally outrageous given everything apparently that IKEA claim to stand for ???The net result of this all friends & family on our first experience will never purchase from IKEA again.They are in the process of lodging a formal complaint although having an uphill struggle with customer services, no surprise there then !I have awarded with a generous 2 star rating as you can tell we are absolutely livid !",0,2
IKEA,The Most Boring Shopping Experience Ever,"I find IKEA the most boring shopping experience ever. Buildings designed for zombies to be carried round via arrows.And what is their stuff? Designed in Sweden and made around the world for the cheapest cost and then shipped to one of their zombie buildings. The environmental impact is massive.It is worth spending time to look at the Wiki page of IKEA and do your own research into their business structure, accounting and how funds are chanelled through Dutch ""charities"". It's a complete sham and kick in the nuts for the small businesses that pay their fair share in corporation tax.A dreadful store, underwritten by dreadful business practices. I have shopped there in the past but make a point of avoiding them now. In no way do I want to fund such a dreadful organisation.",0,1
IKEA,ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! IKEA YOU ARE THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered a kitchen July 14 for a rental property thinking I would be saving time instead of ordering a custom kitchen HAHAHAH! Had a great experience with the store placing my order, and delivery was scheduled for July 31 as some items had to be shipped in from the warehouse. July 30th I get a call with delivery window 2-6, Ok YAY! schedule help to stay for the delivery. 6PM comes and goes, I stay till 7:30, no call nothing, cant get through to customer service number. After an hour and 37 minutes on hold I talk to an agent who tells me sorry, but the system has to update tonight and you need to call back in the morning to see what happened. I also called the store customer service given to me at the time of sale, guess what NO ANSWER, leave a message! GUESS WHAT after four messages to customer service # in Orlando Store #145, NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED ME BACK. OK back to my nightmare - NEXT MORNING, after about 2 hours on hold Ikea customer service tells me, XPO the delivery people have my order, I must call them to reschedule. I am given a number and spend about 40 minutes on hold for XPO. GUESS WHAT? XPO says they dont have my order, I must call IKEA. OK being more pig headed than smart, I call IKEA, well really I sat on hold again and finally talked to IKEA. They put me on hold to find out what XPO says, and come back and say, YEP you're right, XPO says they dont have it. THen proceed to tell me that a truck left the Georgia warehouse July 28 and no one has recorded its arrival to XPO Florida and I just have to sit tight until the truck arrives. OK trying to be the positive person that I am not, I patiently await my ""call"" which NEVER ARRIVES. What to do? Spend more hours on the phone?? NO after a week of waiting, this dumbo drives 60 miles to the store. Sunday August 5, OK I spend time waiting on my number to be called in this DIsneyland of horror, and finally it is my turn. I get an AWESOME customer service rep named BRI, who is determined to help me. She finds out that the biggest portion of my order that was IN STOCK when I placed my order was sent immediately to XPO and received by their warehouse on JULY 16!!! The ""MISSING"" pieces from GEORGIA which havent found their way to FLORIDA in over a week, are still missing so we fandangle the order to cancel those items, so I can take them home form the store inventory! YAY getting somewhere!! I am given the XPO contact name and DIRECT phone # (LOVE BRI) and am told I have to wait for the call from XPO to get my delivery window. I DRIVE MY 60 MILES HOME GLOWING IN MY PROGRESS. Sunday ends, no call from XPO of course. SO I call first thing Monday morning to my DIRECT number, miracle they answer!!!! THey tell me Oh yes I see your order, oh so sorry, you missed the Tuesday truck, already full, and we are not in your area until THursday. OK says my positive self, even tho that evil side of me is thinking that this isnt really real, its just all a big joke on me...Well Wednesday around 6PM I still dont have my ""window"" call, so I call them to the DIRECT line :) Jessica and the ladies at XPO are very tired of me by now. THey confirm YES you are on the list for tomorrow, YOU WILL GET YOUR CALL. OK 8PM or so I GET MY CALL - window set for 1-5PM!! YAY!! I schedule my guys once again!! We are all so excited!!! THursday morning 10:30 am XPO ladies call me (thats a first!!) to let me know, we are so sorry your shipment didnt make it on the truck! WHAT???!!!!! but we are going to make a special trip on Friday and deliver it to you! YAY again, I think? By now of course my rant is getting old and they really couldnt care less, and it gets me nowhere anyway. They actually sit on the phone in silence until I shut up and wait about 2-3 minutes to make sure I am done before they will speak again, lol. ANywayyyyyyy, THursday night I do not get a call, what a surprise!! So I figure why not try my direct number? Its 9:30 at night, but what the heck? THey answer!!! The lady is not happy to see on caller ID its ME ;) She tells me she is working on the schedule that very minute, and could I wait a few minutes?? SURE the positive me says, Ok she tiredly gets back to me with my famous 2-6 PM window. OK Silly me, I SET UP MY GUYS AGAIN to wait for delivery, HAHAHA they must think I have a crush on them by now, this delivery farce could not possibly be real. GUESS WHAT ??!!! ITS NOT REAL. Friday 2:35 PM I get a call from the poor XPO lady ( I think they drew straws and she lost) to tell me, OOPS it didnt make the truck again. Well she didnt escape my rant, while I did try to remain civil I explained That i honestly did not understand 1) how she could work for these people that cause people like me to become raving lunatics 2) how could they have no IDEA why this shipment is so difficult to find out why it cant get on a truck. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GET OFF THEIR BEHIND INSTeAD OF STARING AT A SCREEN AND SEE IF MY STUFF IS EVEN THERE??? Well now XPO lady surprises me and tells me she has me on speaker phone and her supervisor would like to speak to me!!! WHAT THEY HAVE SUPERVISORS?????? I get to speak to MARK the supervisor, who assures me that he is doing what I suggested and getting off his tush to see if he can physically find my stuff, but he needs 2 hours to do that! OK MARK and he assures me that continually ranting in detail is not helping lol. OK MARK, I dutifully await my call. GUESS WHAT NO CALL!! Surprise. 5:30 PM I call XPO and ask for Mark, kudos to him for even answering, LOL, anyway he proceeds to tell me that he called and it went to voice mail and my mail was full and blah blah blah WHAT?!!! Like I didnt have my phone glued to me these last two hours???? OK giving Mark the benefit of the doubt (My positive side again :) and he tells me sorry, I cant find your stuff. UGHHHHHHHHH He had to assign my problem to a professional warehouse Ninja to take on the case and he would get back to me as soon as he could to up date me. WHEN 2021??????? No timeframe, no estimate, NADA So here I am, its 1:00 AM and I am still ranting, but thought I would do a constructive one in the hopes some poor fool DOES NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND EVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM IKEA TO BE DELIVERED!!!! YOU will fall into their endless pit of NO CUSTOMER SERVICE that will eat you alive. ORLANDO STORE #145 still has not responded to ONE of the four phone messages I have left over the last 2 weeks. WHAT??? anyway I guess my only option is to make the 60 mile trek (each way) again tomorrow and see if the stuff I am missing (all 71 pieces) are in stock and I will cancel my order and let it die in the XPO IKEA warehouse cemetery. Hope you had your LOL for the day, unfortunately from the research i have done this HORROR is the NORM with IKEA, not the exception. WhAt A sHAMe!!! People like Bri in customer service and Sam in Kitchen sales do not deserve to have such a crappy company destroying their good service. IKEA DOES NOT DESERVE THEM",0,1

Somewhere in there, buried in the back were the pieces of my bed. The delivery men were exceedingly unfriendly; parking illegally and telling me I would pay the ticket if they got one (there was also a loading dock they chose not to use). They non gently moved the pieces into our apartment. For that it was $100. The bed itself was very hard to put together-- the holes were all slightly too small, or slightly misplaced.

I asked if I could cancel the order since it would be so much easier and quicker to just go to the store and pick them up myself. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't refund me the delivery fee since my items are already in the trailer! WHAT?!Well, Okay.. then why give delivery date options? Why isn't there a better solution? Now I am just waiting again for the items to be delivered. NOT TO MENTION, the driver called me on the day of actual delivery day saying He is running behind. and he should be bringing the items a day after.

IKEA,The absolute worst customer service…,"The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced.I placed my order on July 9th.

On July 17th, I received an automated phone call saying that my delivery would be there the next day between 12pm and 4pm. Stayed home and waited. Nothing. At 5 o'clock, I called the delivery company (North American Logistics). Apparently, they hadn't actually received the order from Ikea yet.I tried calling Ikea customer service, but I just kept getting the same message that ""all circuits are busy."" Weird, I thought.Two days later, I get the same automated call saying my order would be delivered between 11am and 3pm the next day. Sure enough, the same thing happens.I called North American Logistics customer service again, and they said it looks like they still haven't received the order from Ikea.I try again to get ahold of Ikea customer service, FINALLY get through, wait for a representative for over an hour only to be told there's nothing they can do, and they'll have someone from a different department call me back the next day.Fine.The next day comes. No one calls.Honestly, the timeline wouldn't be a huge deal if 1) anyone at either company could tell me where the heck my order is, 2) I wasn't getting phone calls about scheduling a delivery that North American Logistics doesn't even have, and 3) I could get some semblance of a timeline in order to prepare. I've taken TWO afternoons off for this now for nothing.Now I keep getting the runaround between the customer service departments at Ikea and North American Logistics. No one has a clue what's going on. This has been the worst order/delivery/customer service experience I've ever had.Ikea had no problem taking my money, but they're having a serious issue with follow through.

That said, I had a good experience ordering a sofa online (although labor intensive to make sure you are ordering correctly) and good with the delivery 125 miles away. Inexpensive for delivery which is a plus. Ordered a bed online for delivery within the St. Louis area. Mattress & pad came, no bed frame. Incredibly difficult to reach them.

After a couple of weeks IKEA came back and said one of the vanities was discontinued, so we opted for another option in their catalog. Got call from IKEA to coordinate delivery of vanities, received one and second one was in back order. Next received notice from installer to coordinate installation. Installer came to install vanity, but upon opening box he noticed that it was defective. Called IKEA for pick up, but they refused to pick and instructed me to take back directly to store for replacement. Went back to store to exchange vanity, while there coordinated installation of it once again. Today installer came to my home to install vanity, but it was one inch too wide and could not proceed with installation. Once again, IKEA personnel had taken measurements of area and recommended equipment based on area's space. By now, I'm completely frustrated that I will probably have to drive back to IKEA store for credit or exchange of vanity.

IKEA,"Worked over again, last time...","Abysmal. Again. Actually never again...It took the fading memory of previous bad experience, two store visits, physical measurements and wading through a series of switched off floor staff to establish (having been caught out by inaccurate website claims that items were available before) that the so called 'business' section supposedly could ensure reliable delivery in a single consignment of a relatively high value set of carefully matched office furniture. (total €2K+)Despite all of the items being listed on the website on a to order basis it turned out that three of the major items were '..not available and will not be available in the future'.Of the order of two days work in sorting out requirements with the user, selecting the furniture,driving in to confirm dimensions, agreeing a layout, and drawing up a purchasing list down the drain - with not even a sorry in the curt reply from IKEA business. Not to mention the embarassment of disappointing the user of the office.The contradictory stock availability note on the website entry said: 'Delivery only. This item may be available to order at ____Store. This product is not stocked in store and is available for home delivery only. You can either order online or visit your local store and a co-worker can place the order for you depending on stock availability. Delivery fees will apply.'ie the item was offered on the website despite it definitely not being available. Somebody at IKEA perhaps thinks that this sort of misleading kite flying is acceptable, but it's not for the above reasons remotely the case. It'd be less of a problem if you could just pick up the phone and obtain reliable information on whether stuff will be available, but it's a waste of time asking floor staff, trying to phone in or relying on the website.Not even remotely a professional business service.This seems to be a common occurence based on our limited experience. It followed a similar episode a few years ago. About half of a required quantity of cutlery drawers was bought up front, and a cabinet built in our workshop to utilise them. There were none in stock some weeks later when we went to collect the balance. It finally emerged after almost a month's worth of stringing along by floor staff that the item had been discontinued. Despite this it was still being offered on the website.This on top of mutiple wasted trips to pick up smaller items listed as being in stock in store that turn out not to be.I'm not sure if it's down to dysfunctionality or a simple lack of care, but as any student of business strategy knows low cost/budget operations must reliably deliver whatever proposition they offer. Failure to do so destroys customer trust, and costs time and money...",0,1
IKEA,ordered on line with IKEA Direct,"ordered on line with IKEA Direct, never arrived and went to the online Orlando store to see if they could help. They said they could send it from their store in 3 days, never received my order again. After calling and calling and still calling and being on hold for HOURS with that terrible toll free number, I have not had confirmation of my refund. They keep pushing me off and then I keep hearing that their computer went down, or they need to review my file. DO NOT ORDER ON LINE> Please just go to the store and pick up the items yourself.Update: when we finally got through with customer service, they said we would have a refund in 10-14 days. I've called after that period and now they are telling us it was processed wrong and it will be coming soon. Terrible service, never will we buy from them again. I've now got my bank involved in disputing this charge.Update Aug 8, 2018, been on hold 2 hours 26 min. This company is a train wreck. Nothing is resolved. I have 4 case numbers created, very confusing to keep track of the pile of poop they are shoveling.",0,1
IKEA,IKEA is HORRIBLE!,"Shopping online from Ikea is the worst experience I've ever had. I placed online order for 9 items. I had to call customer service (on hold an hour an a half) 2 days before expected delivery date because I wasn't going to be home. The woman on the phone said to give them the days that would work for me and they would put it through to the delivery service to contact me to figure out a better day. 2 days later I get the notification that my delivery is on it's way (this is the day I said not to deliver and to reschedule.) I call customer service back (on hold over over an hour) and they tell me they have no record of a reschedule. So finally we get it figured out that I will get it on Saturday (with a large window of time so I was basically on house arrest waiting for it). When it finally comes, one of the items was missing (the largest and most expensive - a kitchen island). I call the deilvery company, they tell me to call Ikea. I call Ikea (on hold for 45 minutes) and they told me to call the resolution center the next morning because they are closed. I call the next morning (on hold for 50 minutes) and they tell me the item is not available in my area for delivery and that they can issue me a refund and my only option would be to drive to a different state to go to a store and get it there. No where online does it say it's not available for delivery in my area. No where during this whole process was that information ever conveyed to me. I honestly don't know how Ikea think this is acceptable to put people through this. I've wasted so much of my valuable time dealing with the reschedule and trying to figure out where the kitchen island is. I've never had such a horrible experience in my life. Ikea has lost a customer.",0,1

IKEA,Terrible delivery - Cancelled kitchen,"MY ADVISE: DON'T BUY A KITCHEN FROM IKEAOrdered £6k worth of kitchen and a bespoke worktop online and agreed a delivery date 6 weeks in advance. 3 days before it was due I was told some items were not in stock so would not get a complete kitchen then the day after (48 hours before I was expecting it!) I had 6 separate texts with 6 new delivery dates. I already had tradesmen booked in to fit the kitchen. After many calls to their very unhelpful service centre who didn't seem to know anything I was driven over edge and exercised my right to cancel the contract under the failed delivery clause.They are now left with a £2k made to measure worktop that will not fit any ones kitchen but mine and frankly they deserve it. Have now got a Magnet kitchen fitted instead. Better kitchen, better service and delivered on the date promised. Go there instead!",0,1
IKEA,Terrible delivery issues!,"This is my most recent email to the Ikea customer service just so you get an idea of how bad it’s been.Hi there,I’d like to make you aware of an ongoing situation regarding my delivery which has caused extreme stress, excess use of my own time and time out of my job. I placed an order 23rd June to be delivered Saturday 30th. It didn’t turn up. So I called customer services on Monday 2nd July to find out what was happening. Apparently they didn’t have the stock in the warehouse so obviously they couldn’t deliver. However, I was not made aware of this. The team member offered me £35 store credit which I have not received, and re ordered my delivery to come from the Lakeside store on Saturday 7th. It didn’t turn up so I called the Lakeside number provided in the email and they told me there was an error with the order. So they re ordered it for Tuesday 10th and offered £30 store credit which I have not received. Monday 9th I called to make sure everything was right with my order and that it would arrive the next day. But the order was done wrong again and they re ordered it for Thursday 12th. No compensation offered. But this time the team member told me she had her supervisor check to make sure the order was placed correctly.So today I was expecting my order to finally arrive, I had tracking sent to me. Then I check tracking just after 2pm and it tells me delivery failed. I call up, and am told they didn’t put my house number in and that’s why it failed. Refused to offer any more compensation in any form, even though I explained the situation and the issues before. And re ordered the delivery to arrive tomorrow, Friday 13th. I called again this evening wanting to make a manger aware of the situation but was told they don’t have one, just a floor manager, but he can’t speak to me. So I should email this address. This situation has taken so much of my personal time and caused so much stress, I’m heavily pregnant, and work 50 hours a week and shouldn’t have to chase team members mistakes twice a week without them contacting me. I’ve even taken a day off unpaid for one of your delivery promises which cost me over £85. Please show this email to the highest possible of management as this situation is unacceptable and should not be down to me to fix every time and wait longer and longer for it to be fixed.What has been done in terms of compensation is no where near enough for all of this hassle, and to be honest, I don’t want any more Ikea store credits as I don’t want to shop with you again. I want the furniture I ordered, the store credits I’m owed, and to be done compensated some other way. Please listen back to all the phone calls as well if you record them to get an idea of the situation better. I will be sending copies of this email to your CEO and Country Manager.Madeleine",0,1
IKEA,They didn't take responsibility for a faulty product,"I bought an Ikea sewing machine on a whim, but didn't get around to using it for over a year, and when I did it broke down before i had finished hemming up one pair of curtains. When I talked to them they said that they had stopped selling the product, and anyway it was only guaranteed for a year. I took it to an engineer who fixed it but said it had not been assembled properly and had come apart inside. I got back to Ikea to tell them what the engineer had said, but was not surprised when they just repeated that it was my fault that I had not used it within one year. Was there really an onus upon me to use it, or are they well out of order?",0,1

IKEA,Display products not in stock,"We went to buy a crib for our daughter who is expecting soon. We decided to get the Sniglar Beech crib and changing table which are inexpensive, and the changing table is small which was perfect for my daughter’s tight space. We picked out what we wanted from the display area and we to go get it from the pick-up area. Both products were out of stock. After some time, we finally found someone to assist us. She said the crib would be in stock in a couple of days but she had no idea about the changing table as it did not say in her system. I went back to get the crib and even though the changing table was available online I decided to wait a few days. Well, big mistake because not only did it not restock in-store but it went out of stock online. I emailed customer service and received a rather terse and unhelpful reply that said due to manufacturing issues the changing table would be out of stock until November. She offered no solution other than to wait until then. I was very disappointed because at this point the crib had been put together and we did not want to disassemble and return and the box was gone as well. Being a unique color, we are unable to match it so we are having to get a white changing from another store. Admittedly it is much nicer but it is also bigger and more expensive. I do not plan to ever shop at IKEA again. My local store is like a maze. I find it confusing and stressful to shop there. Also, the rep was not sympatric or helpful. Her only solution was to wait 5 months which is not a good solution since the baby will be here in a few weeks. I do understand that there may be manufacturing issues out of their control but they offered no viable solution or concession to me. She refused to sell me the floor model or give any kind of credit or discount toward a more expensive item or any other thing that would have made me feel better about their company.",0,1
IKEA,Supremely inept with horrendous customer service,"Father in law bought 2 new large wardrobes and bedside tables, paying for delivery to Southport which was quite the premium of 35 quid. For such a high delivery price you would expect a premium service but on delivery the guys taking everything upstairs noticed the wardrobe doors had not had any hinges packed. They instructed him to call Ikea directly there and then to report them missing and verified this while he was on the phone. Very apologetic they assured him they would be sent out monday morning and take 3-5 days delivery which in my opinion was the first poor customer service choice. It was their error not packing the hinges so the parts should have been sent out as special delivery guaranteed next day.One week later, he had to call them again as the 3-5 days passed and no sign of the hinges. The call centre drone was very sorry but they hadn't even been sent out but would guarantee they went out monday via parcelforce and should get them in a couple of says. He would also process a £20 discount as a goodwill gesture.Amazingly after another call just over an hour ago, he was told that (yep you guessed it) hadn't been sent out or 20 quid refund prompting him to go quite ballistic though not swearing, resulting in drone no 2 terminating the call. How is it possible to have a company with the size and reputation of Ikea to be so blatantly uncaring and incompetent towards their customers? I can see why there are so many 1 star reviews as they are quite simply appalling. The mark of a company is when there is a problem how they rectify that to leave a positive impression on the customer to ensure they come back again. After this performance, none of our family or friends will be using this sorry excuse for a company and I encourage others not to either.",0,1

When we called him (the driver)he hung up on us so we attempted to call Ikea customer service. The wait was 45 minutes so we attempted to file a complaint online, filled out the form and try to submit but the system was not working.

IKEA,watch the delivery times,Great store experience from really friendly staff - in sharp contrast to the online experience.

IKEA,The IKEA Delivery Service is a big SCAM!,"Never ever EVER order from IKEA online. I am unaware of the in-store experience but I definitely know about the online store. First off, £35 delivery charge for what exactly? Petrol costs? Lifting up the items for you? What is the delivery charge paying for? Anyways I ordered a table, not too complex, a table top and legs. I ordered the table and I get the confirmation and all of the information and a delivery date & time. I wait patiently and go out of my way to wait between those hours. Waiting and waiting, no delivery. I call them and I ask, hello where is my table? They said that the table top wasn't in stock and they are going to get the table top and legs to me in a few days. So here I am a bit satisfied that they are going to get the table top in stock to deliver, oh was I wrong. Another delivery date missed. Called them again and they offered compensation, thank you for that e-Voucher for YOUR store I don't really want since your service isn't worth any money. They say it will be delivered the next day, oh surprise surprise ladies and gentleman, NO DELIVERY. This is when I am just fed up already, a company which is this popular should not be this poor in service and quality. The way they deal with their delivery services is abysmal. You'd think it's organized by a bunch of wannabe business people. I mean that's probably correct. Anyways they told me they will try to deliver again on another date, the day comes, it's a sunny day and I am waiting patiently, I received a text message saying my delivery is on the way and I can use this tracking site to watch where the truck is going. I open the site up and I can see the truck and it's surprisingly on the way, I then keep refreshing it obsessively because I really crave to have something I paid my money for! Believe it or not. I then see it approach the road near my house (this is about 100 meters away) a literal 1-minute drive to my house. Before you know it, bobs your uncle and off they drive back to the warehouse and another unsuccessful delivery date. The most useless, preposterous, poor example of a multi-millionaire company.

IKEA,IKEA online ordering is a nightmare. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,"We attempted to order online, but the website continually failed. After hours of frustration, we decided to order via phone. The representative was unable to spell our street address repeatedly (it's 3 letters) and was generally all over the place. We confirmed that they had the shipping address verbally, they read it back to us letter for letter. We confirmed that the shipping address is in fact different from the billing address.3 weeks later we get a call that our deliver has arrived. Only its 3 states away.They delivered our purchase to the billing address, NOT the shipping address. To be clear, we confirmed that they had the correct shipping address multiple times. The contracted shipper just... couldn't be bothered to differentiate between the shipping and billing address.IKEA's customer service was nothing short of horrendous. After waiting on hold for hours (average wait time is 80 minutes, all the while they tell you how ""fast and easy"" online ordering is) the representative say they have fixed the address and we will receive our order in 2 days. Okay.We get the confirmation minutes later, again, with the wrong address. Call again. Wait on the phone another hour and a half. Now the Ikea rep says they can't change the address. Okay? Wait on hold another 30 minutes. Ask to cancel the order (because this company is horrible and won't get another dime of business from us). Hold 30 minutes. Screw. This. Company. Their delivery service is garbage and their customer service is garbage. Having a different billing and delivery address is not complicated. I mean... this is a furniture company... they should be able to deal with customers who have recently moved. The fact that our purchase was delivered to the wrong address, and then the company repeatedly failed to remedy the situation, is inexcusable. Customer service just blames the contracted shipping company, but then gives no contact information to speak directly to the shipper. Zero accountability, and we had to FIGHT to get the full expense back to us for what is clearly a complete failure on the part of the seller. We'll see if we even get a refund.Will never do business with this company again, and advise others to steer wide clear. Horrible business who could care less about customers. Disgusting business... pay more to a company that has a shred of respect for their customers or buy second hand.",0,1

IKEA,"Probably worst customer service I've experienced, ever.","There are many layers to the issues I have experienced with IKEA, but best to start from the beginning. 1.) I had ordered items from them at the beginning of May, for delivery at the end of May. I was sent an email confirming that the delivery would be made. I took a day of annual leave to receive the items, however they never arrived. I called in to ask them about the status of the delivery, whereupon I was told that the delivery truck was stuck in traffic. I waited for another hour and then called again, at which point I was told that the delivery would not be made due to a glitch. I explained that I had arranged for people to come over and assist with the furniture (who were travelling from quite a distance away), and the fact that I had to take annual leave to receive the delivery. They basically showed no empathy and said that they would deliver the items on the following Sunday and would refund me the delivery fee. When I explained to them that I now had no furniture and that they should have communicated the glitch to me so that I could make alternate arrangements and cancel the people coming to assemble, they basically shrugged it off. 2.) I had finally got through to someone on the phone who was helpful and understood the inconvenience caused. He agreed to refund the costs of an air mattress...to date I have still not received my refund, after submitting the invoice twice. The emails that come from the IKEA customer services are all generic and do not show any empathy, all they were willing to do is hammer home that these ""glitches"" happen and they could only refund me the delivery costs. When I explained to them that I cannot even unpack my new house because I have no furniture, they didn't care.3.) Sunday arrives and my delivery is made. Well, only one item out of 15. When I called them to ask where everything else is, they basically said there was another error and it will be delivered the following Friday. This would now mean another week of no furniture and no bed. When I explained to the customer service representative that this was now ridiculous and I wanted some form of compensation, I was once again hit by the rigid: ""only delivery fee can be refunded"". Once again no empathy is shown and I had people over on the Sunday to once again assist me with the assembly. 4.) Today, out of the blue, I receive an email stating that the delivery date has now been changed to Sunday. Once again I have to now reschedule plans because they have decided to change my delivery without telling me why. Also, I won't be able to build my furniture on Sunday and as such I will now have another week with no bed and clothes and computers on the floor.My issue here is that nobody cares from IKEA. The attitude is certainly not consumer friendly, and given their volume of business, they genuinely do not care. I have not been refunded for the air mattress and at no point did they offer a discount or assistance in assembly, considering it will be me paying to live in a house with no furniture. At no point was it communicated to me that there were stock issues. How is this fair and how can IKEA get off with no culpability in this? Judging from their Trustpilot score, I seem to think that I am not the only person with these issues, and I also think that they genuinely do not care given their size. I wish to escalate this, but customer services keep passing me on to another agent who tells me the same thing.",0,1
IKEA,Ikea Perth/WA,"Ikea Perth/WAUsed to be better but recently hard to buy items either in store or on line. We started with 6 fixed wardrobes, glass front, slide doors, shelves, racks, about 60 items altogether. Main boxes were not in stock at the time we were in store, supposed to be next day, then weren't, we spent 2 weeks trying every day on line, always something was missing, wrong information about availability, then we reduced order to whatever was at the time, we moved forward to payment and couldn't pay, as some items were not available even though were in stock a few minutes before when browsing. Then we removed almost 50% of order, bought whatever we could, paid on line with delivery, next day had a call that some items are still missing, we cancelled it and requested refund, got it confirmed then same day courier rang that is making order and some stuff is missing, we told him it's cancelled, he was surprised (???). We are trying to buy at least the big parts for those wardrobes for more than a month now, hoping to collect small things over time, it's not far, but again, things available becoming unavailable when it comes to payment and availability information stating around 8 weeks, which might be wrong later anyway. Customer service is super helpless over phone and email, twice gave us most useless information ever like ""please try again another day"". We are slowly giving up idea of buying from IKEA, we had plan to buy kitchen after that, but having this experience, are looking for other shops already, before we even started. Is somebody from headquarters controlling what's going on here? It's not only the worst Ikea branch but the worst supplier in the whole city.",0,1
IKEA,"Good for small purchases, appalling for anything requiring post service care","I ordered a mattress on finance within the Reading store and the man working took my details down incorrectly meaning that when my first payment was due, the payment declined thus affecting my credit score (about to arrange a mortgage so sounds a lot worse than it is). Called Ikano to amend payment details and they then took the details down incorrectly AGAIN!! thus another strike on the credit rating. Made a complaint to them but they basically couldn't care less and blamed IKEA (even though the second time was their fault). Called the customer service line and whilst they sympathised, they told me that I had to go into the store and lodge a complaint there. Myself and then my partner have been back twice so far and have not heard anything back from IKEA at all. I am in the process of complaining to the financial ombudsman but unlikely that I can have these impacts on my credit rating removed without IKEA helping out. They are not prepared to do this. Whilst IKEA are a good company to use for small bits and pieces around the house, if you require anything that requires post sales service, they are not for you. I will now be, and have been since, using John Lewis for any larger purchases as this would not happen on their watch. They actually care about your experience and I fear this could have been resolved in a more timely manner without so much time and effort from me.

I have now spend 3 days and a combined wait time of 3 1/2 hours waiting for a resolution manager to get the 5 damaged shelves fixed. I am on hold at this time still waiting. On the last call when I spent 20 minutes getting to the first person on the call, I asked what was wrong with their phones. I also asked to talk to her manager which she did not do as I wanted help to get this taken care of.I will never order anything on-line from IKEA again. I did the on-line order to save 4 hours of driving time. I would much rather drive and not deal with this. I can't see ever using their products again. Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced and I am 69 years old.I continue to wait on hold listening to their recorded message about how easy it is to use their on-line system over and over again and how quickly they will respond shortly. How unbelievable that message is given my experience. I don't know how much longer I will wait for the resolution manager but need to get this fixed, so I wait.",0,1
IKEA,Avoid at all costs!!!,"The worst experience of customer service ever! We were excited to be moving house and decided to order new furniture from IKEA for us and our kids rooms. Unfortunately thing did not go to plan. We went to our nearest store and ordered over £3,000 worth of furniture which was all our savings. We were told by the staff that all items were in stock and set delivery. Great so far, so good. We also booked assembly service for the following day.We got an e-mail confirming the time was 11-3 on Thursday (a week day off work). No delivery!! We call and they tell us sorry but some of items were out of stock after all and they would not be coming!! Nothing they can do!!!So we re-arrange again this time for Sunday, promised 11-3. We get another e-mail and text comfirming delivery, we call and change assembly team too. Again it doesn't come!! We call and are told, oh sorry some of your items are a months wait now or discontinued so thats why they didn't turn up!! We asked why we were not informed about this and they just said sorry!! We cancel the items which are my childrens beds and who are already sleeping on mattresses in their rooms and my little girls chest of drawers! and ask for the rest to be delivered!! We are given another date and again re-arrange delivery and assembly who knows if it will come or not!!!!The best bit is that IKEA can't give me a refund back to the account for items or assembly, I have to go back to store and get it!!! Awful!!!!! Please avoid at all costs!!",0,1

Turned out on the second appointment they had meant to remove the screwed bottom legs(!!).

They literally don't call, or knock, or buzz. They just get a picture of your apartment number, and that's all they need to prove they tried.

I had to frantically take one piece up at a time on my own, risking having some of it stolen as I couldn't watch them all the time. The other experience was more recently - I ordered a bunch of things online, got several emails and text messages (from the courier, ParcelForce) telling me when I'd get the order - I was impressed - the only problem is it was all lies. I didn't get any of the items when the text messages said I would.

IKEA,The delivery service in a IKEA Dublin is a disgrace,"The delivery service in a IKEA Dublin is a disgrace. In IKEA Dublin shop, we have been told delivery is accommodating and the person we were speaking with put a note on our delivery for the hub/driver to deliver our products between 10am and 1pm on Monday 23 as it would have been hard to be home from 3pm to 5pm. The driver called us at 3:03pm saying that he could be to our place in 30 minutes. We told him it was too late now and the driver told us he could do the delivery tomorrow morning. The day after, I took the day off from work to wait for the delivery and nothing. We then called the customer service to ask them when they were going to deliver. We first spoke to someone who contacted the Hub and told us it wasn't possible and, all of the sudden the phone hangs up! I We called again and continue the conversation with someone else. This time we learnt we were not scheduled for delivery and that we had to re-book, that the delivery was not going to happen today and neither tomorrow! We were not happy with this, but asked to be delivered on next Tuesday because we are away, and we have been told there is a 4 days turn around for deliveries and that it can only be on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. We have been forced to ask a friend to get the delivery on Sunday for us and now our friend has to wait from 7am to 7pm to wait for the delivery. Even if drivers call an hour before the delivery, which is never true since they typically call 15mins to 30mins before they arrive, it is totally unacceptable to give no proper notice of delivery and force customers to stay home all day, while waiting for the call! There is a zero lack of flexibility and communication, they keep you waiting for as long as possible when trying to solve the issue by phone. So we got our friend to render herself available to Ikea delivery on a Sunday from 7am to 7pm, and now we even have to move everything from our friends place to ours (useless to have it delivery on the first place).

IKEA,Terrible company.,"Terrible company.April 2nd, I ordered a desk to be delivered.

The person who finally answered said the delivery date is only a suggested date. The delivery could actually take anything from 2 to 4 weeks.I ask to cancel my order. When I ordered, nothing was mentioned about this potentially taking a month to deliver a very basic computer table. I was told it would be delivered today.She puts me on hold. I am then on hold for 90 minutes. That's not a typo. They put you on hold for 90 minutes when you tell them you want to cancel an order.When the next person finally answers, I tell her I want to cancel. She says she'll cancel it, but I won't get the delivery fee refunded, even though nothing has been delivered.I tell her that's unacceptable I want a full refund. We go back and forth e a few times, she basically tells me ""too bad"", and then puts me on hold again.I've now been on hold for another 30 minutes when she gets back on the line and gives me a reference number. They are not going to voluntarily refund the delivery fee. I will have to see what the refund is then dispute the charge.In today's world, service like this is a disgrace.There are plenty of places to buy furniture from. Find a reputable company and avoid this company at all costs. Order a desk from Amazon and get it delivered in two days or go to a local store and support your local business.I will never again even consider buying from Ikea.Updated on May 22, 2018:I received word from my credit card company. I had filed a dispute with my credit card about the charge and my credit card has given me a full refund, including the delivery fee that Ikea didn't want to refund.Ikea is the worst company I have dealt with in many years.

IKEA,Kitchen Installed Against Regulations,"Kitchen Installed Against RegulationsI planned my kitchen with Ikea, took the plans back to them multiple times to review to ensure something like this did not happen. It's not until we tried to get a new cooker (which was an amazing deal which we have now lost out on) a few months after the kitchen was installed we found out that the extractor hood above it was installed far too close to our existing oven be legally safe. The oven was on the plans. The extractor itself (and the entire kitchen) was installed by Ikea fitters and in the instructions for the extractor it specifies a minimum distance it needs to be from the cooker/hob, and was installed in our kitchen 11cm too short of this distance. Because this was installed into a cupboard (also installed by the fitter, also on the plans reviewed by Ikea), we now have to get a new cupboard at additional cost to ourselves, and fit it again. This is not something I expect to happen when I ask the kitchen department to review the plans and make sure the kitchen is safe & acceptable. This is not something I expect to happen when paying for an entire kitchen. This is not something I expect to happen when I pay again for professional fitting (which had several other additional problems in itself; fitters turning up late, leaving early, finishing the job a day late, shoddy workmanship which was have had to cover up)What I do expect is swift resolution from Ikea.",0,1

IKEA,Darwin was not right,"Take popcorn and sit, below my history:1) Bought a kitchen in december2) Kitchen delivered late with missing part 3)multiple mail and phone call to service number (each call waitnin min 1 hour) 4) At the end I was asked to go to the shop because they could not do anything5) Went to shop (1 hour driving / 1 hour waiting / 5 min speaking / 1 hour driving back) . Finally Ikea employee acknowledge that a part was missing and promised to send it6) 2 weeks without and news7) other calls 8) finally part was shipped Unfortunately I still needed a working desk for the kitchen so I had to go to Ikea 1) Asked Ikea to plan a working desk according to the kitchen project done by Ikea itself (present in theirs archive) 2) The employee probably unable to read numbers bigger than 200 projected a working desk (U shape) with one side 10 cm longer t and another one 20 cm longer than the project3) Received wrongly projected working desk 4) 10 phone calls (each one waiting 1 hour ) and same number of email 5) Finally the solution: ""Ehm...... could you go to the shop?"" - ""Sure, I spend my day, normally waiting to go to the Ikea shot to explain the workers what they should do!!!'6) Went to shop, explained the situation to an employee (This time I had acknowledged some embrional level of understanding"" ) said: ""Oh gosh, you are right, this is our mistake!!! I mean we planned a working desk based on OUR kitchen project and we mistaked bi 30 cms!!!"" Trying to show some understanding to the clearly difficult situation in wich such comapny must find itself just said "" Well, you know, maybe it was also my mistake, I should have checked the work of your colleague...."" Answer: 'Absolutely not! it was our mistake and in 6 weeks we will fix it!"" Tired but happy, I went home7) After 2 weeks without any information I tried to call the mitical authomatic number, also here 8 calls and 12 emails 8) After being replied another time to go to the shop (because in reality I leave there, on a mounted bed) finally somebody that must be considered, according to local standard, some kind of nobel prize answered: ""Sorry but we cannot do anything, it is your measures, not ours"" With laughing tears I answered to the local evolutionary missing ring that 1) The measures were their measure because the project was their project 2) that we had already had the same conversation including a pilgrimage from my side to Ikea shops and we had already agreed to change the working desk.Those two concepts together clearly need time to be elaborated so I am still waiting for an answer.....My suggestion: stay away from those guys, they simply have no idea what they are doing!!!!!",0,1

IKEA,Beware IKEA,Beware IKEA. The products look good (if you like that sort of thing) but they are shoddy. Purchased 2 items over the years. A desk had the wrong draw front and I had to rout out a new part to fit. Just purchased the EKET shelves. Don't waste your time and money. 2 of the 5 bought don't fit together as the components are misaligned. IKEA's problem is that it sources manufacturing around the world and clearly quality control is poor. The store is too far away to travel back and return items so you end up doing a fix yourself. I won't be buying from IKEA again.,0,1

The staff just watch. Have done this several times over the last year, and each time the staff are more than happy to watch while twiddling their thumbs. Only help I have recieved was for the odd customer who has seen me struggle and offered to take the trolley to the tills,while I push the wheelchair, but even this is rare.To add insult to injury after I have paid only then they may ask if I need help to my car. Ikea should start to help their customers more. If anyone else has had this problem, how to get a wheelchair and a loaded trolley around the area I would be interested to hear, as I do not think I am the only one who has this problem.",0,3

Why should I, I bought it from Ikea. After getting no responses from Ikea I contacted Electrolux who then instructed me to ring a repair agent. What customer service from either the seller or manufacturer!!. The Engineer visited end of December. Walked in looked at it and agreed the model had problems with spin sensors. Said he would send in a report. Visit time 5 minutes. Waited and waited and waited so finally I rang Ikea mid January to be told they didn't have the report and would send out another Engineer. Rang Electrolux they insisted report to refund/ replace had been sent. Went higher up the ikea chain to find someone who admitted the report had been received. Finally an offer to pick up and refund. This goes on re the pickup, no notification of a time block as promised, but a 10 minute call from the driver received when I was not at home. From beginning of November to 26.01.18 we have a washer that doesn't spin. We have relied on an 20 year old zanussi upright spinner that was in our garage to finish the spinning. Ikea advise now they will pick up at 4pm today, I'm not holding my breath. This washer was £400, I have ordered one of better specification elsewhere for £300",0,1

On 3 occasions I have got home to see that the now 'safer' perspex glass is crack under the protective cover!!!They're terrible quality and the same price as the 'old' ribba frame that had the actual glass......! Its just an excuse to save manufacturing cost by using cheaper product in my opinion.I would hope im not the only one with the same complaint. id recommend going back to using glass.Also got onto ikea online chat.

There are always reasons that stopped them from coming, such as no confirmation, no answer, truck broken-down, etc... Stupid reasons.. The customer service offered no help and simply told me that they didn't know what happened. They neither tried to help nor understood my time being wasted. All they do is to keep making new pick-up schedules for me and not able to tell me what time the pick-up trunk is coming. Excuse me! They thinkI just have all the time in the world in this holiday season sitting in my apartment for a whole day waiting for some trucks that would never ever show up, huh? In conclusion, this gives me so many disappoints from this company. Yes, their furniture is cheap, but it does not mean they can treat their customers like the penniless.",0,1

Box 3 (sofa came in 3 boxes) was missing so we couldn't assemble the sofa. Asked for a re-delivery TWICE (on 2 different days) and both times it never showed up due to a failed booking despite customer service confirming it would come and that it was booked in. Useless and incompetent employees work in customer services and they promise to call you back but they never do, probably because they p*ss themselves when they deal with angry and fed up customers. Ended up having to drive down all the way to IKEA Lakeside (where we ordered it from) and picked it up ourselves as we gave up on waiting for the delivery.

IKEA,Their excuses should go in a book for the worlds worst excuses in history,"If I could give this company zero stars I would,what an utter disgrace, ordered our last kitchen unit 2 weeks in advance to come on 15th December, in time to finish the kitchen for christmas. Paid for the delivery. It didn’t come, I’ve heard 4 different excuses. One being their delivery drivers were given 2 days off because of snow. Considering they got parcel force to deliver and it wasn’t that bad in Peterbrough that excuse doesn’t cut with me. Their other excuse was that parcel force where 4/5 days behind in their deliveries and that parcel force would not deliver on a weekend. Very strange when we phoned up parcel force and got them to deliver part of the parcel on the Sunday and they hadn’t even phoned them at all. They offered us £30 gift voucher for their store which considering my husband has took days off work to complete the kitchen, we’ve phoned up everywhere trying to chase our missing parts is a total insult and after the way we’ve been treat do they seriously think I’d ever want to shop in their store again!!! I explained to the company my children ranging from 18 to 27 had lost their dad in August and I had invited them to mine for Christmas dinner to try and make it as nice as possible under the circumstances yet they have told me they cant deliver it now until the 30th December. We even offered to drive 350 miles to get the unit ourselves and were told we wouldn’t be allowed through the security gate. We told them to bring it to the gate and we would wait outside they still wouldn’t allow us to go collect. We asked for managers to contact us and they don’t have any aparently, contacted them on Facebook and they answered a few messages and then stopped replying.

IKEA,Come on Ikea - get your post-sales customer service act together!!,Shame that delightful in-store kitchen department staff are so badly let down by a shocking level of customer service from the post-sales delivery team. 4 stars have slipped here - and if I could I would drop the last one too.I have always had a firm view of Ikea as being a trusted name - but this has now been totally reversed by a rubbish customer service. From the new kitchen that I had delivered just one drawer panel was faulty and had to be replaced. Ikea couldn't order a proverbial **** up in a brewery - twice now I have been promised a date and received the usual text etc beforehand - stayed in and arranged my day so that I could sign for the goods - then been disappointed when twice they didn't turn up. Builders booked both times so have incurred cost there too. Hopefully third time lucky for delivery a few days before Christmas but too late for it to be installed. Keeping fingers crossed that they do in fact deliver when they say they will. Otherwise I will have to find a way to remove that final star. Not happy - I hope other customers take note - and especially whoever is in charge of customer services at this giant company. Shame on you.,0,1

IKEA,What next?,"Firstly, IKEA reminds me of the long, horribly slow moving queues in the USSR, where communism meant scarcity for everyone equally unless you were a privileged elite... When you want to eat/drink at IKEA, you have to queue at their cafeteria, which can be such a long wait in the end you give up. If you don't give up and manage to get a tray of food and drink, which i must say is reasonable priced/cheap, after you are done eating/drinking you must not only take tray back but also ''help them recycle' - they have 4-5 bins where you must put your leftovers and rubbish in, then place tray with plates, cups etc on conveyor belt to go in for wash. Queue for that too. Fair enough, the food is cheap but the products are not as cheap. Now i am wondering if they will ask their customers to also wash the plates after they are done? We shall see. In any case, i like their products but just be wary of what you buy and why.",0,3

Fittings were exact and tolerances of unit parts strengthened those parts.However, the Tjana file boxes were of a such an extremely low quality cardboard, they looked like a joke. I demand a refund.The Drona cloth shelf boxes were attractive and functional while the Branas whicker baskets were so weak and ill fitting they are not fit for purpose. I demanded a refund.The Ballymun store experience is great while the website is so dated its ridiculous. Janis and Ciaran were especially good in the store as were the checkout staff.

IKEA,BIG COMPANY WHO HAVE A SERIOUS LACK OF RESPECT AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Bought a corner sofa , when it arrived half of it was brown (suppose to be dark grey) and the brown half was 100% a reject or refunded as it was covered it layers of dirty old fluff and looked as if an animal was sleeping on it. Then complained and said they would send a brand new sofa ( one that was ONE sofa and ALL one colour as we ordered) waited 5 weeks again for them to get this NEW sofa delivered it was the long weekend so we had to cancel our weekend away as we thought the arrival of the sofa we had been waiting patiently on was more important, then no one showed. Which is not surprising as half of the comments on here explain the lack of decency that Ikea show to its loyal customers! Then went in and complained after cancelling our holiday for absolutely no reason!!!!!! Then they told us they had lied the whole time and the sofa was completely out of production meaning there was no 'new one' which was suppose to arrive . They said they will have to refund us the money for the sofa after wasting 2 and a half months altogether , kept waiting and waiting and no hope! I cannot express how utterly disgraceful Ikea is, for such a big company all they care about is money and could not give a feck about customer service. If there was a NO STARS rating on this that's exactly what they would be getting and what they deserve , absolutely shocking to say the least.

We complained and it was arranged that the x2 panels would be collected and replaced today - Wednesday 18th October. My Husband had to take the day off work to wait in all day for the delivery men (My Husband is self employed so we lost a days wage) We have now discovered that one of the panel's for the bookcaseare is damaged..... AGAIN! Feeling extremely fed up and annoyed I phoned Ikea Croydon to ask for a full refund. We are told that the bookcase will need collecting, I explain my Husband has partially assembled it and taking it apart would cause damage. The woman then tells us we would not be entitled to a full refund!! They offered to replace the panels again but I refuse to waste anymore of our time and money on such cheap rubbish delivered by morons who are clumsy and careless. Ikea have completely wasted our time and caused a massive inconvenience to us not once.. but twice! We have lost significant money which has made a negative impact on us and it is all down to their incompetence and negligence. Ikea have taken no responsibility and are refusing to refund us for their misconduct.

IKEA,UNACCEPTABLE TREATMENT BY IKEA,"I've had the worst experience EVER with IKEA in Germany. It's been insane!!! I ordered furniture online to be delivered on friday the 6th. I stayed at home waiting the insane time span they make you stand-by (14-21) and NO ONE CAME!!! I was furious and called the next day. They said the delivery people hadn't followed ""protocol"" and that they would reschedule on the next tuesday the 10th. So again I waited from 14-21 and again no one showed up. No I was just so incredibly angry and I was told that my errand would be sent to another department that would call me back ""sometime"" they couldn't specify when and I of course could not contact them in anyway. Of course no one in this incompetent company called so I called once again (sitting fir like the 100th time in their insanely long phone line). This time I demanded to speak to someone above the idiots in customer service, who obviously don't have any authority to do anything. They said the guy was on a break and that they would call back in 10 min. NO. ONE. CALLED. I have no decided to demand a full refund and hopefully some store credit or something for missing 2 half days off work and living without furniture for 2 weeks. I am SO disappointed in this whole experience.",0,1

IKEA,Ikea Thurrock Lakeside Essex,"(In my own personal opinion or perception) the place is an absolute dump.*The staff non existent customer service I've never come across a set of rude, blasé' nonchalant assistants than this place. I used to have to go to Wembley which was the nearest store, when this place opened the staff were all nicey, nicey now they dont give two hoots. Their only concern is surrounding you at the tills to make sure you pay, with security that look like out of Camberwick green (I'm so scared). if I wanted to nick your goods I would go around the other way and just walk out of the entrance.*The food and the restaurants at 1720 hrs today the place looked like an earthquake, food everywhere staff milling around doing absolutely as little as possible. The Logan berry juice dispenser empty again ! I noticed the staff putting massive portions of fish on plates laughing and joking, then taking them out of the back kitchen doors. The food they served the customers slopped on the plate like food in the military out on exercise, (kids meal = 6 runner beans, 10 chips and a piece of fish that looked like 2 fish fingers stuck together £2). Absolute joke ! Dirt. muck and filth all over the restaurant seating area and 1 lady cleaning a central curved carousel table, over and over again. ""Obviously waiting for the night time cleaners to do most of the lackeying"" ?* Management where are they ? I never see them and they certainly aren't about kicking backsides into work ? it's no wonder the place is so badly run. If this is the way they do things in Sweden which I know for a fact it surely cant be, then things have changed in the land of Volvo and Saab.*The products aren't worth the money any longer, there's too much competition out there now like B&M stores, Wilko, and pound shops.

IKEA,Ikea customer care is appaling,"Just had the worst customer care experience in my life dealing with a delivery. Ikea changed my delivery date twice to suit them as they did not have the goods which I had ordered and paid for in stock, The second change was made, at 7.30 in the evening the day before the delivery was due. When I phoned to say the day they wanted to delivery didn't suit I ended up talking to a rude young man who to say the least was unhelpful. I needed to know what time the new delivery would be and all he would tell me was between 7am and 7 pm I asked for a supervisor to call me, he assured me this would happen yet an hour later, no call, When I phoned again, he had hidden by order on the system, making it virtually impossible for the person I was speaking with to find my details,. When she eventually did, he had not changed the delivery day as requested, meaning that 37 packages would have been delivered to an empty house. Nor had he logged my requested for a call back I have tried to speak to someone in a senior position to make a complaint to but Ikea won't give any contact details. I have emailed them and no response. Their products are okay but unless you have no other option, I would avoid their delivery service.",0,1

IKEA,IKEA doesn't care if young children fall from the stairs or get electrified,"A while ago we ordered two Patrull stair gates and a small Patrull night lamp at IKEA. We ordered them on the website and got them delivered, since the IKEA store is very hard to reach for us.We don't own a car and don't have driver licenses (purposely). To get to the IKEA store we have to walk to the railway station, to take the train, transfer to an other train, transfer to a minibus service and finally walk about 15 minutes in an industrial area. On my own it's already quite a journey. To get there with our small children (0 and just 3 years old) is nearly impossible. And when we would ever get there, we have to get back home too...One of the advantages of getting the IKEA order delivered, is that you don't have to get back to the store, when something gets broken, but a repair service comes to your house.Now appears that the stair gates and night lamp are disfunctional. They are unsafe:- The stair gates can suddenly open, so children can fall from the stairs. Epic fail from IKEA!- The cap of the night lamp can come off, so children can get electrified. Again: epic fail from IKEA!IKEA called both products back, so costumers can get there money back. Apparently IKEA doesn't want to be the company that let toddlers fall from the stairs and put 220 volts through their little bodies after all.However...We have to take the unsafe stair gates and night lamp to the IKEA store to get our money back. I tried to explain several times that this would be impossible for us, but IKEA just replies with their standard answers.""Sorry sir. We didn't provide for this. We're not going to provide anything for this. You can also take in the products later. Even a year later.""In a year we still don't have a car, so we still got stuck with the unsafe stair gates and night lamp.Because IKEA behaved this irresponsible by bying or developing cheap 'child safe' products, we have a loss of about 100 euro. (Two stair gates, a night lamp and the delivery costs. When we order new, safe stair gates, we have to pay delivery costs again, so this is also a real loss.)I offered IKEA to send them a picture or video, with me destroying the products, so they can give our money back. They said that wasn't there policy.Without blinking there eyes IKEA takes 100 euro from a family with two young children for potentially lethal products, but they're not behaving responsible when they get caught selling this very dangerous rubbish.So, is this the earning model of IKEA? Take your money and let your children die? Not cool! Not cool at all!---Update: of course, after banging the internet drums, IKEA did pick up the dangerous items and will hopefully give the money back.",0,1

The best item I have is the Poang chair - which is uber-comfortable. The only trouble I have with is it is the dog likes to sleep on it.",0,5
IKEA,"Stylish, good deals, decent quality","I've been a fan of IKEA for years for basics like shelving, drawer inserts, dishware, rugs, etc. I previously had an IKEA bed, but it was too basic for my taste and I now have a more decadent bed. But if you like a more simple or classic aesthetic, their beds are pretty good. I still have a mattress from them that I love! I was skeptical about getting an IKEA mattress at first, but my mom's friend had one and loved it, so I decided to test theirs in store. I found the prices to be amazing compared to other mattress retailers, and liked the firmness of the foam. Unrolling it was kinda fun too, because it poofs up and expands before your eyes! Building the furniture used to be a pain, but I've actually gotten pretty fast at it now that I have an electric screwdriver (IKEA too). Plus, I have moved enough times that I can remember the building directions by heart. I find I have a small sense of pride after building the shelves or whatever. But I know for others that's an annoyance, so if you plan to get IKEA staff to build for you, make sure you evaluate the total cost when comparing other stores. For some items you may not be saving much, and their wood is closer to particle board quality, so you may be better off getting a sturdier piece for a bit more. I personally find the quality to be good enough for my shelves and whatnot, and didn't have a problem when I used to have an IKEA sofa and chair set. However, the bed I used to have did have slats that broke in several places, and the wood on the table I have scratches pretty easily.",0,4

We heard a massive bang and went and looked and the door had been pushed over by a ikea catalogue delivery, now if something won't go through the letterbox does anyone think that is should be shoved that hard it pushes a door over and smashes against and damages our bannister. We contacted ikea who passed it on to the delivery company who basically put the phone down on us and will not get back in contact despite leaving messages. This is down to ikea as I've passed it back to them and still getting no response. Disgusting behaviour from a leading company and we have a damaged banister...

Normally I would not write about IKEA, because everybody knows them anyhow, but after this recent experience I really have to say that they positivly surprised us and exceeded our expectations: Regardless what furniture we were looking for, we found it at IKEA. The quality of the cabinets was clearly better than expected. F.e. the surface coating is much better, thicker and more robust than with other producers in the same price category. But the best was really the aftersales service: regardless what issue I had, it was immediately corrected, swift and with no questions. In one case a package had been damaged, in another case something missing. A phone call was enough and a few days later we got the spare parts, even in one case 2 years after.",0,5
IKEA,Joseph McDowald,"I'll leave the short version.. We bought a couch for $700!! Got it delivered the next day (an additional $70 fee)...then spent 3 hours in the delivery line to top it all off. Got it delivered, at 11am next day Opened the box and found a few screws missing. Went back up there and it 2 hours for the customer service rep to give us a new bag of screws.Got home opened the bag and they were THE WRONG SCREWS!!! I spent about 45 minutes comparing the screw to see if there was an error, NO WRONG BAG, WRONG SCREWS.By now it's about 3:30 pm, our whole afternoon is almost over. Feeling very irritated we went back up there again!!! THIS IS WHERE THEY CROSSED THE LINE!! After a brief conversation the customer service rep brought out ADRIEN in Recovery Clearance. This guy was so rude to me, my mother and girlfriend, accusing us of not knowing what we were talking about and out right telling us we were lying. We told ADRIEN several time that the screws we were given the Second time at IKEA was the wrong size but ADRIEN refused to listen. He continued his aggressive rant leaning over, over-talking my mother and girlfriend and telling them they were all wrong!! Kind of upset I kept my composure to explain to ADRIEN that I personally spent 45 minutes assembling the furniture and he must have made a mistake. Even still his aggressive demeanor and assertive over-talking watered out my obvious complaint. Still we waited and after another 2 hours we finally got the 2 SCREWS we were waiting for. The customer service rep and ADRIEN grouped together to inspect the screws, with ADRIEN bellowing under his breath. ( there were 2 different sized screws by the way)Upon leaving I asked the customer service rep to speak to ADRIEN I felt my mother and girlfriend deserved an apology for how he talked to them. I wanted to see if he was a man of integrity, could admit his wrongs and forgive my family for the disrespect. He claimed he couldn't come out for whatever reason after spending the last 30 minutes arguing with us. If he would have came out and apologized I would not have left this review but...ADRIEN IN RECOVERY CLEARANCE IS A RUDE, INDECENT, UNPOLAGENTIC EMPLOYEE WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY AND RUNIED OUR 8 HOUR LONG DAY AT IKEA!!

Everything was delivered on the correct day too. I had to call customer services and was waiting for 18 mins to get through. Not great but when I did get through, the man I spoke to was straight to the point (although lacking the pleasantries and chit chat some other companies engage in..which wasn't a bad thing).He ordered a replacement part because a part of the wardrobe snapped whilst I was building it.

IKEA,Indescribably awful home delivery service.,"My pregnant wife and I were in IKEA yesterday, 31-03-2015. There, we were told that we couldn't get some of our products right away, even though they were on stock, because they were at the top of the warehouse and had to be picked up after closing hours.We were instead offered to pay for our order and have it delivered to us the next day, for 600DKK extra (200 for ""plucking,"" 400 for delivery). We paid the order in full and were promised it would be delivered between 15 and 19 today, 01-04-2015.We have waited the whole day without anyone arriving or calling.

Instead, I was told that I should expect my order on Saturday. I said I found that unacceptable, since i have waited for the order and was not going to be available on Saturday. Then I got a call from the transport company, saying they would arrive today after all.They have arrived at 20:30. The order they delivered was 90% wrong. Most of the items on my list were missing, and many items I didn't order were included. They took the order back, and I insisted they give me a contact number for someone who could solve my issue. Upon calling that number, I was told I should instead call IKEA kundeservice, which is not closed. They will be closed for the following 2 days. This means that my wife and I won't get the chance to use our two days off to prepare the baby's nursery, like we planned.In conclusion: Delayed delivery, ZERO communication until I myself took the initiative, wrong order. Order at your own risk.EDIT 05-04-2015: Yesterday (Saturday), I still haven't received any contact from IKEA. I called them instead. We agreed that they would deliver after 19:00. I re-asked twice whether I can be assured that my full order will be delivered. They twice guaranteed that it will.Since then, and up until now (Sunday morning), I have not heard a word from them, via phone or email, and nobody has delivered my order, even though I have waited at home since 19:00.I wish it were possible to give companies negative star ratings.",0,1
IKEA,Waste of space,Purchased a Hemnes (shoe box) in store - got it home and yep - missing parts. Rang customer Service same day - waited 15 mins - ordered spare part - delivery was 3 - 5 days by courier. 7 days later re-contacted customer services - another 15 mins wait only to be told a date had not been set for delivery so had to be done all over again.F&^%$ Why why why do I bother shopping with Ikea waste of my life.Spare part arrived 3 weeks later - was returned in the mean while... pathetic!,0,1
IKEA,APPALLING after sales.....,"I placed my order online on the 13th of August, delivery arranged for the 24th of August. A number of items were damaged on delivery. On the 25th I emailed them using their online form to inform them of the damage and received an auto reply stating they would reply within five working days. NO REPLY. I emailed again on the 3rd of September, received another auto reply but still NO RESPONSE. On the 9th of Sept I decided to ring them - 35 minute wait to speak to customer services!!!! The guy apologised and said he would process my refund. NO REFUND RECEIVED. I rang again on the 17th of Sept - 15 minute wait - the lady informed me that they had 'new staff' running the refunds department which was causing delays?!?! So do those staff also run the 'email department' as I still have not received a reply to those either? The lady apologised and told me that I would receive my refund on that day or the following day - you guessed it STILL NO REFUND.Absolutely appalling having to spend so much time chasing this company, I would have expected far better customer service......",0,1
IKEA,"3 months later, still no sofa...","Ordered and paid for a sofa from Ikea online in Sweden 3 months ago. Expected delivery date was 3 weeks from order. It has been delayed several times with a new date each time, but now the expected delivery date has passed and not been renewed. I have contacted customer service twice since. First time they would get back to me same day with a new delivery date, which did not happen, second time after 30 mins on hold they put me through to the ""transport department"" and was on hold for another 40 mins before I had to stop the call.",0,1

IKEA,You can not complain about Ikea's service. There is no....!,"I bought 6 pieces in Bangkok in beginning of august 2014, as well as several other items. It is the chairs it is about. The two loose legs on the chair was packed wrong. The paint was not properly dry before being packed and they were just packed closely together without paper between. The result is to destroy some of the paint.One of the chairs was completely deformed, so we had to spend a few hours driving back to Ikea over in Bang Na. The problem with the wrong package, they knew well ...!? [COARSE LANGUAGE REMOVED] ? The chairs were assembled, so that was my problem now.After they found a chief who had the necessary permission to undertake a replacement of the chair (half hour), we could then drive home again.I have asked Ikea the following questions: Was it a good idea to equip the factory in China with quality control? Should they have a quality, then they should perhaps consider using a different one, and not from blind Foundation.Ikea didnt answer my letter.When you have a product that has a known bug with the paint, so I think you should consider to solve it, and not like now, where I have to figure out how to repair the two chairs that are damaged.See the pics here: [EXTERNAL REFERENCE REMOVED]In the restaurant we got 2 bonus tickets, each at 100 Thb which could be used for the purchase of furniture. By paying it appeared that I could max use one at a time. We should of course shared the order in two. At that time I only wanted to leave the store, and if I had been here without his wife, so I had gone without my goods long time ago, in fact since I came to the store where I have to figure out what parts I need, where to find it, and how to handle 2 heavy shells. A woman didnt want to give us any kind of help.I chose to go back and give it to another customer, Ikea should under no circumstance be spared the 100 Thb.PS .... It was my first visit to an Ikea store ......",0,1
IKEA,The products are just ok.,I have ordered a small table and a tv stand from Ikea and placing the order was pretty easy and it arrived fast but once everything was put together it just didn't have the quality that Ikea portrays. I do not think they with last long but we shall see.,0,3
IKEA,The worst customer service I've ever received,"I used there online store when ordering the goods, I ordered the hensvick baby unit set wardrobe changing unit cot ect.. I hesitated to order at first as i thought the delivery was expensive (£35). But had no choice as i am about to have baby and cant risk driving far also lifting and to be honest it wouldn't fit in my car. So after a week of ordering and paying for the goods the delivery day arrived but only half of my delivery was there couldn't fault that men that delivered them friendly nice and offered to take it up to babys room for me. I asked about the other half of my order and they said it was damaged ikea didn't pack which is fair enough they then said they should have contacted you which they never for all i knew i was half the set down. So i then got on the phone to them after waiting 40 mins in a que to get threw to someone i gave up and left it till the following day after waiting again on hold for a further 50 minuets i eventually got threw to a nice enough lad called lee explained the situation he apologised ect not that it was his fault explained i was having baby in 3 weeks and wanted it all set up can i just collect it saves waiting around for more weeks he said hell check and call me back no call back no nothing that then made my experience with ikea online even more shocking don't sympathise if you don't care i was more then understanding as i know these things happen, maybe if i was a irate customer i would have got delt with there and then i would have preferred to be called all the names under the sun then fobbed off! However the day after i got a call from some rude lady saying shes sorry shell get another one sent out asked about a date or a ruff chase date nothing couldn't tell me just that its going to come so more then likely after my baby is born so the nursery is not set up!! so after chasing them wasting my time paying 35 pound for delivery and paying for cost of calls i have received the worst customer service! Not good enough for such a big international company.",0,1
IKEA,Awful experiance with ikea.co.uk,"As we had just moved into our new house we thought we would order a spare bed for our visitors due in 3 weeks time. So we placed a order and within a week our delivery arrived.....1ST CALL. Waited for 45 minutes for a response.Having received our delivery for a bed from Ikea we noticed there was no bed slats included on the order notes or in the delivery. After phoning Ikea we spoke to Sarah, who informed us that the reason for this is because we didn't include them in order. This was not the case as it was included in the price of the bed and it was a fault with their order management software. Delivery is to be rearranged on Saturday.Waited on Saturday until 1 pm after no indication of delivery confirmation of the dispatch of ETA of arrival. 2nd call. Waited 45 mins for a response.Spoke to a unknown Rep, who had no information about our case as the previous rep had not included enough detail in their CRM/Case management software (poor show Ikea). Rep said he needed to make another call and would keep me on hold for a few mins. After waiting 45 minutes the automated system dropped the call....3rd call. 45 minutes on hold.Spoke to Richard, who was useful however he informed me that he was due to finish his shift in 30 minutes and would forward our case into a responsible person who he confirmed would take ownership of our issue and call us back with a follow up on the status of our order.3rd call - 5pm Saturday 45 mins waiting for a response.Spoke to Shane, who very honestly admitted it doesn't look like its coming today. Which resulted in our house guests sleeping on the floor.......Shane processed our order for some new bed slats and rearranges a 3rd delivery slot for us. despise us informing him that we cannot simply book a day off work at the drop of the hat to receive these orders he books us in a slot for this Monday 9-4 pm. No use to us what so ever... Shane then put a request in for a £30 voucher for our troubles not enough in my opinion.4th call Waited 45 minutes for a response.We then rearranged delivery for today 23/7/14....WHAT A SURPRISE....Delivery does not arrive.....How can a company as large as IKEA treat their customers like this?!?!I would not recommend ever purchasing a product from Ikea home delivery service. As our experience has been a absolute nightmare.",0,1
IKEA,"Bad product , Cheap Quality , Bad service , Bad company","I bought a Sultan bed and every time I sleep I fall down of it because of terrible production After contacting them they sent me someone to check the bed after 2 months awaiting his visit he refused to accept the fact of bad quality of the bed and I still have the bad bed which I paid 5400 kroner plus 1000 kroner to be delivered to meMy advice Don't buy any furniture from Ikea , only small things because the Quality is cheap and does not worth the money for it",0,1
IKEA,The small things that matter,"Last week I fell through my bed 3 times within a single night... (well, 2 times to be honest. The 3rd time it was my GF, and since I was sleeping like a babe and never even woke up to notice her cursing and moving to the sofa, I can't really complain about that one ;)Anyway. Turns out the slatted bed base wasn't broken, but simply shifted between the sides and fell down through the opening. Since the bed had been incresingly squeekish ever since I moved from my old apartment I decided to check the screws to see if they were still alright... Imagine my suprise when I found that half of the screws were not there! Suddenly I felt very lucky that I hadn't completely ruined the bed in the last months (moral of the story... If your little brother says ""Go take care of the dishwasher...I'll set up the bed by myself, no problem!"" Make sure he doesn't discard half the screws and uses tie-wraps instead because he finds it quicker...)After checking my supplies I found a breadbag with most of the screws and several other missing parts I never even knew existed, but in the end I still came up short on a few of those long typical IKEA screws... Since the bed was over 10 years old and was no longer sold by Ikea, I feared I was screwed (yes... pun intended. Shame on me) But I decided to contact them anyway to see if I could buy them somehow. I was very glad that all they needed was the amount of screws I needed and the screw id-number, - I found this in a manual online- and they would send it to me free of charge.Five days later I received the screws in a giftbag with a complete Customs Declaration. Origin; Sweden. With them I was able to fix my bed, and what do you know... It hasn't squeeked once since. Nice service!",0,5
IKEA,I am still pinching myself to make sure I did not dream it.,"I usually grumble about IKEA and everybody who used them knows why. But this time they,or to be more precise a bloke called Mick Groom was absolutely wonderful. As many people probably know IKEA has recently decided to annoy the customers by discontinuing some lines in the middle of the life of their catalogue, so I had difficulty of buying some doors for my cabinet frames. Mick not only arranged the order for me from start to finish but gave me a discount.How is that for service? Wait,that's not all.He arranged for some fabric samples to be sent to me as my local store does not sell them (why?) and so saved me a long track all across London for a few swatches. If everybody were like him at IKEA...",0,5
IKEA,'Talk the talk but don't walk the walk!',"I ordered a wardrobe a few weeks ago. After spending three hours putting it up, I found that the last piece (the door) didn't have the holes for the hinges. Not a massive problem but I'd like to have a door for my wardrobe. Called after sales and spoke to a lovely girl who was sorting everything out for me, or so I thought. She said I would receive a replacement part within 3-5 working days. Great.After 4 days, I heard nothing despite being told I would get a text. So I called and spoke to a nice guy who advised that the part was with DPD and that he would get some tracking details for me. This never happened.My mum has called today to then be told that the part hasn't even been dispatched yet! After being told this I was livid so decided to call up myself. This time, the person who answered the phone sounded like he couldn't care less. I got a 'what ever' after almost everything I said. He then said he would get me the tracking details, the same as the two previous people. Looks like I'll just have to wait and hope that there is at least one competent person at the company who can fulfil my request and not constantly lie to me! Most definitely will not be ordering again.",0,2
IKEA,I felt like being cheat with no after sales service,"I live about 15 miles from Ikea Croydon. Just order the bed frame and other stuffs to be delivered two days ago, realized that the bed frame doesn't included the instruction/installation menu. I called csutomer service but alway keep me on hold and rather impossible to reach them at all. In one of the call, I have been waiting for more than 45 minutes on the phone listening to those music they play on the phone. I believe non of any company let you hold till that long. Seems I have to work from Monday to Friday, with no other choices, my partner over 60th have to help me to go the Ikea Croydon by train and ask for the instruction. Again, the next day after compare and instruction menu so many tools was missing from the packaging and some of the woods look used with some old screw inside. Again, couldn't reach them by phone, I have no choice but have to take a day off and go the Ikea again just because of the missing part and discrepancies of the products. Never never purchase from them anymore if you wish to have good after sales service. Small items should be fine as you can easily see them from the packaging but not the big stuffs.",0,1
IKEA,Disgraceful Delivery Service,"Sorry for the long review, but I'm quite annoyed and feel the full story is the best way to illustrate Ikea's incompetence.Firstly I'd like to say the customer service staff are very friendly and helpful - I had no problem with them. The only issue there is the long call wait times, generally 10-15min minimum.The major problems came in with the delivery service. From the start, this was an absolute shambles. They initially gave me a provisional delivery date two weeks in the future, which was an annoyance but not unacceptable. A week later, however, I received a text message saying that they'd pushed back the delivery a week further, without any explanation for the significant delay. I decided to suck it up and just wait.In terms of delivery restrictions, I live in a town centre directly on a bus lane, so I informed Ikea that they wouldn't be able to park on the road and that they would need to pull up onto a drive next to the building. They sent a full-size lorry into the town centre, which wouldn't fit onto any drive I've ever seen, and barely fit up the road itself. Obviously, the delivery didn't go ahead, as the lorry drove on. I then had to wait an hour before I got a phone call from them to explain that they would have to redeliver another time on a smaller van, and that I would get a phonecall confirming this.This phonecall took 4 days to appear, at which point they confirmed a new delivery date (now 4 weeks from the original order date). Deciding to make absolutely sure this delivery would go through, I rang in again to confirm the delivery restrictions. The delivery service hadn't put that a smaller van was needed on the system, so I explicitly stated this to the call handler and it was put onto the system, otherwise I would have had a lorry come again.Roll on yesterday's delivery. I was given a delivery window by text of 6am-9am, which was a pain, but I was desperate to get the items delivered at all cost, so I left my phone on all night and waited for them to call. When I'd heard nothing by 9:30 the next day, I phoned customer services who were incredulous that I'd been given this delivery window as they can't deliver before 7am. On the system I was down for delivery between 1pm-5pm, and I'd get a call an hour in advance of delivery.Fine, I thought; I can go out and do other things as long as I'm back by 1pm. Wrong. I received a call at midday saying 'we'll be there in 5 minutes'. Being half an hour away, this wasn't ideal. Luckily I managed to convince them to wait for me to get there. When I was half-way there, though, I got another call. 'I don't think we're going to be able to deliver today as the van's too big and there's nowhere to park nearby.' Being already half-way back, I wasn't accepting this and convinced the driver to wait nearby. When I got there, I could see that the van would fit into the drive next to the building and told him to circle back round and park on the drive.Unfortunately, the ordeal didn't end there. As they unloaded the packages i could see they were numbered out of 9, but only 5 came out. Fully 4 of the 9 packages were missing. The drivers phoned up the warehouse and told me I'd get a phonecall once the warehouse staff had looked for these. I received no call yesterday, and now to today.I decided to phone up today to chase this, and according to customer services there was nothing on the system - the drivers had listed the order as complete. Possibly as revenge for getting them to do their job and deliver my items, possibly just further incompetence from Ikea. Luckily the call handler was helpful, and set up a search for the items and gave me a case number, but it's going to be at least 48 hours before I hear anything.So that's where I am now - one month after ordering, one fully failed delivery, one partially failed delivery (that would have fully failed without a lot of persuasion) and no idea when this will be resolved. I'm not looking forward to the next delivery, and I would recommend anyone considering purchasing items from Ikea to rent a van and pick it up themselves!",0,1

IKEA,They Didn't Refund Me For Something They Broke!,"I bought a lot of furniture from Ikea in one move and it was kind of a nightmare. They delivered the wrong couch then took an entire week to pick up the wrong one and switch it out for the right one. Worst of all, they smashed an expensive mirror I had ordered en route, then failed to re-deliver a non-broken one. When I called and requested a refund, I got nothing. Who does that?!",0,1
IKEA,Better shop in store than online!,"I ordered a chest of drawers from IKEA online for delivery. They sent me an email explaining I am to wait for a followup email on when it will be delivered. 2 days later i received the email. No options for delivery dates/times (like online food shopping does). So, the day THEY chose was not good for me and i needed to change. I spent 2 weeks trying to contact IKEA and wasted so much phone credit! On my way home from work I had a missed call received 2 hours earlier, 'We're outside your house, with your delivery.'I was livid. Re-called then and there and they said they are an external delivery service, so for a redelivery it will be charged. Only good thing about the experience was I did receive my refund AND my phone credit once I gave proof. Just, will not be ordering for delivery in the future.",0,3
IKEA,Ridiculous waste of time!,Very poor customer service who does nothing to help you. Defunct delivery system. Poor communication.Complete waste of my time.Would not order from IKEA online again.,0,1
IKEA,"Online shopping convenient if limited, pricey delivery though","Ikea, where everyone feels conflicted. Happy to be able to get the light I wanted, for about what travelling to Ikea would cost me and with much less stress. I'm very glad that Ikea have introduced online shopping. However, nine pounds delivery for an eighteen-pound light is a bit steep, and the two other things that I might have purchased to make the delivery charge seem fairer weren't available for online purchase (why??). Ok experience, better to have done it than not to have done it.",0,3
IKEA,"Never, ever order online from them",Crap. Don't answer the phone and just keep you on hold. Don't reply to emails. All I'm trying to do is cancel an order due to extortionate shipping prices that aren't made very clear before payment. Absolute crap. Livid,0,1
IKEA,Waiting for deliveries to arrive - still waiting,"This has got to be the worst service I have ever received!Started by looking for items online and whilst considering the purchase a determining factor was delivery time. Online estimate was for the 8th of November which was fine. After I bought the product I was told the delivery wouldn't be until the 15th of November, which almost doubled the time I had to wait! I found that not only annoying but also slightly dishonest.I waited in on the 15th all day and effectively lost a day's worth of work, but thats ok if the items then get delivered. But, they didn't. When the delivery slot had 'expired' I attempted to call Ikea but the phone-line was engaged - I waited in excess of 35 mins in a queue and gave up! My Wife attempted to call again later - still in a queue for the best part of an hour, just to be told that the driver attempted to deliver my goods but there was nobody in! Now that I find insulting - he has obviously not been at the right address or he is lying. She asked for an immediate re-delivery but that could not be facilitated and I would have to take another day off work the following week. She asked for a refund of the delivery cost, which also couldn't be accomedated until delivery had taken place and the driver had been interviewed. So, she cancelled the order.I have still lost a day off work and have to find alternative place to purchase furniture. Its is poor service!Jesper Nors",0,1
IKEA,Absolutely awful,"This is the shortened version with some of the shortfalls left out to slim this down!We bought a bed frame and mattress in August this year, as one of the things that reassured us was the 90 day pledge to exchange the mattress if we didn't like it. We were promised delivery the next day, but on the day of delivery we had to call them after 5pm as nothing had arrived. We were told that nothing at all had been scheduled and, bearing in mind our old bed was by then, at the rubbish tip non delivery was not an option and I made this clear to them and this was eventually sorted out but it wasn't a great start. The real problems came when we decided that we needed to exchange the mattress as it just wasn't comfortable. The one we had tried was extremely comfy, but the one we endured for around a month was rock hard. The staff in the store, although polite, didn't seen to understand the 90 day exchange or know what to do. We spoke to three different people in the store and went away on the understanding that we would receive a phone call to schedule delivery of the new mattress, the old one would be picked up and as the new mattress was slightly cheaper, a refund would be processed.The new mattress has arrived and the old one wasn't picked up and I have no refund. Every time I try to call there's a 30 - 45 minute wait to speak to someone, and all they can do is pass information on. The store won't get back to me and I have sent numerous emails to complain.I have never experienced such a terrible system where you can't call or email the store directly, and the call centre can't help. The whole thing has been a joke from start to finish and I will never use them for anything again.",0,1

IKEA,Not bad..........,"Product wise IKEA are of course excellent.I recently returned 2 products on 2 different occasions. Both purchased from their store - both returned within a week at the same store. The first time I was told I'd be charged 30% because the product was assembled. The second time my girlfriend was given a 100% refund. Perhaps my breasts aren't big enough, but the lack of consistency was strange..",0,3
IKEA,Very good,"I have to confess that just about all of my furniture is Ikea, so I have shopped there a lot. When I had a delivery of £1,200 worth of their furniture 6yrs ago, which was ordered online, it was a very pain free experience. I had a cupboard door, which was of a natural wood colour and whilst not faulty, had too much red in the it, making it look odd to the other 3 doors. Ikea swapped this without issue. The quality of their furniture is also good, 6 years on, everything is still as good as the day it arrived. I like building my own furniture, as I customise the items to fit against my high skirting boards, so they fit flush to the wall. Very pleased.",0,5
IKEA,Worst Customer Service Ever,"Delivery lorry arrived, drivers had no idea which items were mine so I had to ferret around in the lorry finding my name on the boxes. Packaging was filthy, so had to open everything outside. Legs of chair were missing, cover of chair was ripped open and dirty. Rang customer services, they refused to courier the items out to me, and said I would have to wait 6 days for standard truck delivery of the items (these are small items, which would probably cost a tenner to send on a next day delivery. Ridiculous). I asked for some kind of refund of the delivery as I had taken a day off work to wait in for the items, we also have family coming to stay and this furniture was for their use. We will now have to quickly go out and buy the furniture elsewhere. Customer services refused any kind of refund of the delivery, and when I asked to speak to a manager they said 'they won't think any differently so there's no point'. The Ikea items will have to be returned, which will cost about £20 in petrol for a 2 hour round trip, plus the original £35 delivery charge, so I will have paid £55 for the pleasure of some dirty packaging and an unpaid day off work. Thanks Ikea, you really are as rubbish as everyone says.",0,1
IKEA,IKEA disses disabled,"This review is for the store in Schaumburg, IL, USA. I am disabled and although I used to love to shop at Ikea, I am so sad that I cannot anymore because they do not have motorized shopping carts for disabled people. They have a bunch of manual wheelchairs that I cannot use, and that are always sitting there unused by anyone. Also, whenever I have asked an employee to assist me ... I cannot believe their rude responses. They just want me to go away and leave them alone to do their jobs, which obviously is not helping customers, and especially not disabled customers who are so darn needy. Ikea is non-disabled friendly in so many ways. Shame on them. I was going to try the one in Bolingbrook, but I see in someone else's review that they also do not have motorized shopping carts for disabled patrons. I asked an employee why they had no motorized carts for disabled shoppers and she said because the aisles are too narrow! LOL. Maybe they should use some of their own organization products.",0,1
IKEA,Home delivery,"I used their home delivery service to get some furniture. I was unable to get time off work for the delivery slot they allocated me, so I rang them to change it. I was on hold for around 45 mins on an 0845 number to get it changed from Tuesday to Friday. I came home from work on the tuesday to find that delivery had been attempted. I was furious that I had spent money trying to get a delivery slot changed and they hadn't even done it properly. I was able to change it with the courier, luckily but sent a complaint to Ikea. A woman phoned me regarding my complaint and treated me as if I was stupid and I had gotten it wrong! When I explained I had recieved an email that confirmed the Friday delivery slot still no apology. Would not use again.",0,1
IKEA,Home Delivery Sucks,"Ok, Ikea UK has decided not to acknowledge my complaint but it would be in everyone's best interest to know that their £35 home delivery charge is a total rip-off and a terrible experience!Here is what I wrote to Ikea:I have a very bad experience with delivery. My order number is 382960546 (bed, drawer, etc 6 items), order date online was 30/6/12. The original delivery date was 6/7/12. I had to take annual leave from work to receive the order. The truck arrived but the driver came without the right equipment to deliver the items. The driver was rude and mentioned that insufficient feedback when I have clearly instructed him to load at the loading bay. He was not interested and simply wanted to pass the job back to someone else. This is frustrating enough as I have wasted a day of my annual leave. The driver made another delivery date 9/7/12 and I have asked for previous delivery time of 11 am. However I have not received any confirmation and when I tried to check on ikea online delivery the system reports that no such order exists. I am now in a situation of either taking another day of annual leave tomorrow risking no show from the delivery. This is not a good experience at all!",0,1

A lot of people slag off flat pack kitchens, but I put it up correctly and employed a private chippy to put a worktop on and do the finishing touchers and it looks better than others in very expensive shops and show rooms. total cost for our large kitchen was less than £3K, fitted and finished (dont use ikea fitters as they are expensive - did most of it myself as its not brain surgery - and employ a good chippy to do the finishing touchers - save loads of money that way).Ikea fitters wanted £3K to fit a £2K kitchen, thats just wrong.Other kitchens by other companies of simular look (but in my opinion not as good quality were about £10KI purchased the kitchen including appliances and paid a chippy and had change out of £3k",0,4

IKEA,No complaints.,"I tend to use the Ikea UK website for surfing then checking stock availability at my 2 local stores which is very useful. I have ordered some large items for delivery recently and had no problems whatsoever with it. For extra discounts on selected goods, it's probably worthwhile getting an Ikea family card. This also gives you the opportunity to view future months discounted products.So a thumbs up from me.",0,4
IKEA,IKEA Kitchen  - very mixed results,"My new IKEA kitchen is remarkable quality for the cost, but the good news stops there. Their estimator/designer made several mistakes with components that resulted in lots of unnecessary phone calls and visits to the store (a round trip of 140 miles each time). Plus they ""forgot"" to put our fridge freezer on the first delivery, sent the wrong plinths and shelves etc. But, absolutely the worst part of it was trying to get through to customer services on the phone. After waiting a long time in the queue, I was frequently just transferred back to switchboard to start all over again. On reflection, the quality and value for money just isn't worth the stress and inconvenience for such a major project. IKEA is fine for wee bits and pieces, but don't trust them with a major investment is my advice.",0,2
IKEA,"Great shop, terrible customer service","I like the sstore and the goods are excellent value, but try and complain online and the response is terrible. They resisted paying me compensation for months even though the amount in question was only a couple of pounds.",0,4
IKEA,Awful service. They don't give a shit,"Bought a kitchen 1 year ago. Fridge door was faulty. Have since had NINE fridge doors, none of them were any good.Still have to close the fridge with gaffa tape.WHAT A FRIGGIN JOKE.",0,1

IKEA,At no point during the order process did ikea.co.uk live up to what we expect from an online retailer,"The age of online shopping - it should be simple & easy. Ikea - it must be preferable to being herded around one of their cattle shed retail outlets, it has to be... I' rather spend a week lost in an Ikea store than go through the experience I've had with their astoundingly poor half-arsed online division.Ordered two products. Rather surprised to hear it'd be 2-3 weeks before they would arrive - that's not what I'd expect from online purchasing but hey-ho, the order is placed, no going back now.So 2.5 weeks pass, a driver calls to say he will be here within the hour, just as Ikea's text message said he would.The items have been packed at the very front of the wagon. The wagon has two holes in the roof. The items are wet through and damaged. The items go back...After several calls to Ikea, they finally 'phone back regarding the replacements: ""We will call you this afternoon to arrange re-delivery"". Eh? A call to say they will call? What's the point of that?No call.I called them back the next day, I'm told it'll be another 2-3 weeks before the replacements arrive.2 and a bit weeks later we receive a call from the driver's mate - will be here in around an hour. Some minutes later, another call - ""I just noticed your items are packed at the front of the wagon - there is a hole in the roof, your items are both wet through""...deja vu?!Ikea wagon arrives, we tell the drivers they must have sent out the same items or used the same wagon again - they are strapped in at the far end of the wagon, the wagon has the same holes in the roof on either corner with all kinds of nasty green gunk where water has obviously been seeping through for many weeks or months.The driver tells us that this is a common problem - their wagons are regularly damaged by trees, especially in Wales (?! Welsh trees must be tougher than our puny English ones, I dunno...)So it seems to me, not only do Ikea have a very loose idea of what customers expect form an online shopping experience, they also have a fleet of (I'm told) 300 wagons, of which many have exactly the same defects as the two that attempted to deliver soggy chipboard shelving to our house.So as it stands I'd rather risk buying some poorer quality Argos shelving than have anything to do with the Ikea brand ever again, I'd take Engrish flat-pack over Swedish soggy any day of the week.",0,1
IKEA,refund policy,"Just took the item back to customer service desk and was given a refund immediately.Helpful friendly staff As I don't live near a store it took some time after purchase for me to return item, no problem to IKEA.I have bought many items there and this is the first time I have had to return anything!",0,4

IKEA,Ikea Croydon - avoid,"Like others I've used Ikea in the past and been happy enough with the experience. However our local Croydon branch has now descended into a fleapit of dispair.Walking through the unhelpfully signposted 3 miles of showrooms, most in a shabby state, we found the thing we were looking for and moved on to the warehouse to pick up the flat-pack box.Having come prepared by checking online first that they had plenty of the item in stock, all we supposedly had to do was find which aisle it was located. There were 4 touch screens at a help point to enable you to find things, but 3 of the 4 were broken (zero points for maintenance), and the 4th one only partly worked, and naturally suffered from crowds/queues. Once I got to the screen it indicated that iritatingly the item wasn't on the public shelves, so had to ask customer services. Randomly manned information desks reinforced this obvious lack of service, and was told to go somewhere else to ask for it to be retrieved from out back.Landed in another long queue which initially wasn't manned at all, and only a passing staff member noticed that 10 people were angrily waiting. Staff scribbled numbers down on torn scraps of paper for more un-motivated staff to stroll slowly off and browse whilst the queue just got longer and longer.About half an hour later I was then told that they did not have the item in stock and that they knew it shouldn't have been shown as in stock on their webpage.... This negligence and hopeless stock control underlines what a pointless waste of space this company has now become.Key points1. About as disorganised and mis-managed as a 50 pence bizzare, which ironcially it now so closely resembles. 2. Poorly maintained showroom, a shabby shadow of it's previous self 4-5 years ago3. Poorly signposted and therefore painfully drags out the dire experience even longer4. Unprofessional - you couldn't have paid to train an organisation to run so dis-functionally5. Nasty, messy and tacky are all things which Ikea Croydon can only aspire to achieve, and has some way to go to reach these dizzying heights",0,2
