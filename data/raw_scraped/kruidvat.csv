Kruidvat,Rude staff,I went to Shopping Center Mariahoeve Kruidvat. I wanted just a question because my first photo book order but your man staff so rude and disrespectful. It is unacceptable. I don't go to your Mariahoeve Kruidvat.,0,1
Kruidvat,room scent diffuser…,I just bought a room scent diffuser (lavender/bergamot) and it just does not deliver what it should. The scent is virtually non-existent and certainly does not smell of anything resembling the perfume. How do I change this for another product? It is most disappointing.,0,1
Kruidvat,Perfect service,Beautiful Mat style photos. Delivered in the store on time. Very simple process.,0,5
Kruidvat,HORRIBLE photo service,"HORRIBLE photo service! Handed in my disposable camera for the pictures to be developed in January, was finally able to pick it up towards the end of March. Turns out they only developed 10 out of 27 pictures! Sent an email to customer service, they tell me they can't retrieve the pictures and that there must have been something wrong with the camera or the way I took pictures... let me tell you how for 2 years prior to this incident I've been using the exact same cameras and sending them to Hema where ALL 27 pictures have ALWAYS been perfect. I'm so mad right now.",0,1
Kruidvat,still confused,"Bad experience. First time i order something online on Kruidvat. I update my account, get an error. After a while it works, i chose my items and pay. Suppose something went wrong once more during or after payment because the order in the end did not appear in my history. So i contact client service. Ask if i should wait any longer or just place another with the request that if it is double to cancel the 2nd one. The employee simply says i don't know and closes instantly the chat. I find it rude. I won't bother myself ordering here again.",0,1
Kruidvat,The quality of photoboek is amazing,"The quality of a photoboek is amazing. We have been doing photobooks in diffrent places already and this one is defenitly the best. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because I think the kruidvat app (for app I will give really 1 star),where you create book is quite enjoying and we had problem to crop our photos the way how we really wanted. We also tried to find some tutorials, but it was nothing, what helped us.",0,4
Kruidvat,Kruidvat Gilze,"HoiI was today at kruidvat Gilze and they are fooling the clients!! The offert with the price was for other product which wasn't there anymore, the shelf were full with other products and the women which work there was arguing with me that I have to open my eyes!!! This is not my problem is her problem, you trick clients thinking this is a good offer!!!Next time I will double check but where is the trust??? I mean you have to put the right price not trick your clients and then have a big mouth!!! She was very rude!!! Like this you only lose clients and make a bad name for the company.For the future you should hire people which have respect and know how to speak with the clients!!!And is not the first time when this is happening!!My advice, buy max 3-4products and then get out!!!!",0,1
Kruidvat,Worst company ever,"Worst company ever! I ordered from Kruidvat the first time, a few days ago. The delivery was damaged and automatically got returned. They not only refused to help me or provide me credits for my next order, their customer support simply said this is the way it is, I dont care what you say! It's so annoying! Worst customer service ever! Pathetic! Would never order or recommend it to anyone. Etos service is much better required lower amount of items for free delivery and amazing customer service. Kruidvat is pathetic!",0,1
Kruidvat,Complaint,"I ordered 3 vouchers of ""4-DAAGSE STEDENTRIP MET VLUCHT EN VERBLIJF"" on 22nd of September. Later on when I tried to use it, I found a minimum of 2 travel people is required. It was not easy for me to find a second or third person to travel at the same schedule, so I made a phone call to (0318)798001 on 7th of December and inquired if there is any solution.A madam asked my order number, personal account and some other information for verification, and then informed me that I will get my refund in three weeks. After three weeks I didn't receive any refund, so I made a phone call to (0318)798001 on 31st of December again. To my surprise, the lady who picks up the phone said she didn't find my request on your system. She said she will look at the case and give me reply later on that week. On 6th of January, this lady wrote me an email, saying ""We cannot find a request from our system. It was never known to us that you want to return the city vouchers. The official withdraw period is 14 days, so it has expired. Unfortunately we cannot do anything for you."" It made feel surprised and annoyed, not only because I got different answer, but also the city voucher has expired on 31th of December: I cannot neither use it, nor get my money back. If I have been informed that it is not possible to refund at the first or even the second call, I would anyway find a way to consume the vouchers, which spent me €387, instead of falling into the long waiting time and let them expired. so I made a phone call to to (0318)798001 again immediately, explained the whole situation. Your colleague answered my phone and said will report the case to his manager. On 15th of January I got his reply, informing me again the official cancelation date has passed, and it's not possible to give me refund and cancel my order. Still no solution. It is a very irresponsible way of Kruidvat of doing so and also very unfair for the customer!",0,1
Kruidvat,Frustratingly unwilling to provide up-to-standard customer service,"For some reason, when making my last order, they automatically selected an address where I have not lived for more than 5 years. I saw it as soon as the order went through, before it was even processed, but was told that there was no way to update to the correct address. Then things got worse.I have spent the past 5 days trying to track down what happened to this package. Thankfully, some helpful neighbors at the old address told me it was sent back. So I called Kruidvat, and they didn't even bother to take my order number to double-check. They said I have to wait two weeks, and if I don't hear anything or receive my money back then, *maybe* someone will help me.None of this is remotely acceptable. This is far, far below the standard of every other website of this type in Europe I have ever dealt with.The second star is only because the woman on the phone was polite, and it's not her fault. But Kruidvat needs to very seriously reevaluate their policies and bring them in line with the modern standards provided by their competitors.One more headache like this, and I will go back to Etos. Paying a few cents more for certain items is worth the guarantee that I will receive those items or be helped when something goes wrong.***EDIT: Response to Kruidvat's BS copy-paste response: I STARTED by contacting your customer service. This empty copy-paste ""make the bad score go away without actually doing anything"" response made me lower my score another star. I am seriously done with Kruidvat (spent a bunch of money at Etos yesterday instead).",0,1
Kruidvat,Kruidvat just keeps cancelling orders (is it really just bait??),"Ordered a special offer and should actually not be surprised this item was cancelled by Kruidvat.nl - the reason I should not be surprised is that this isn't the first time they pull this trick. This time (Senz XXL storm umbrella) they said ""there was a problem with the supplier to get the umbrellas"".Now forgive me if I'm wrong, but to me that sounds like a business-to-business problem that is not to be put in my lap as a consumer. Go fight over it with the supplier but do NOT simply cancel an item for a consumer. For all I care you purchase your goods from another vendor and claim the additional expense with the initial supplier: that's how a business to business deal works.The fact that you cancelled your offers on multiple occasions led me to leave a one star rating. Maybe one day this company will understand WHO is the customer and HOW to provide them good service. I will simply give up ordering from them, and can understand of you, the reader, will also order from another store.",0,1
Kruidvat,I will never buy tickets from Kruidvat!,"Thank you for giving me to share my terrible experience with Kruidvat. I said to the clerk, ""Please give me two zoo tickets."" But she gave me was two train tickets, and she said that she can not change anymore and she can not even my money back. I claimed this to the customer service. She replied me that they checked the recorded image and they had confirmed that I had pointed out the train tickets. I had no idea what she was talking about though, I tried to recall that moment. I guess I pointed out to what she had in her hand, because I had no daubt at all that she had zoo tickets because I surely said to her ""zoo tickets"". But It can be happen when my eye sight is not so good and she did not show me clearly so I pointed out that.But anyway in the first place I surely said only one time ""two zoo tickets please"", now she insists that I said THREE TIMES 'train tickets.' This is so ridiculous! How I can say three times this words when I have not even single one of this in my head? So I asked her If they have audio record for this conversation. Of cause they do not have such a damaging evidence for them, and they have only favourable one for them to blame a customer for their failure. I have noticed by reading the other persons reviews below that this should be the culture of this company.They never think of possibility of their faults instead they are very eager to find customers faults.Apart from this, I also do not understand the selling system of tickets with Kruidvat. Once they issued that, why they can not cancel and no money back anymore? This incident between me and the kruidvat clerk was caused by just simple human mistake.I guess that when I said ""zoo tickets"", the clerk did not hear ""Zoo"" part and heard only 'Tickets ' part. I think she associated it with train ticket by herself when she heard it. I was not going to blame for that, it can be happen and I just wanted to change them to the zoo tickets that I really wanted.If its really impossible to cancel the tickets once they issued, why Krudvat do not train the clerk well? They could have trained them well to make them sure what the customer wants and what they are going to sell. Because this kind of small miscommunication can be easily happen in such a messy store.Now what should I do with these unwanted two train tickets? It is going to be completely wasted and moreover we had to give up going to the zoo.Because this incident was too bad, I will avoid to buying things at Kruidvat as possible.On top of which I have learned that I should NEVER buy tickets from Kruidvat, train or zoo whatever!",0,1
Kruidvat,Treated like a criminal for using foundation TESTERS,"For Kruidvat Langekerstraat Schiedam:I tried to find the right shade for a Maybelline FIT me foundation and I used about 6 testers (stripes on my arm and face) and the store manager accused me of putting make up in the store + raised his voice towards me for having ""used all concealers that were not testers""...which is not true! I used 1 TESTER concealer (given I had found the right foundation shade), the rest were testers used by other people before. I asked him to show me the camera recording for what he says I have done. Together with the security guard, they checked the tape, without me, in the back of the store, and afterwards told me ""it is ok for now but next time use less""... Not ok! If you accuse a customer of doing something wrong and the customer says differently, show them your proof. I have been treated like a criminal for using foundation TESTERS. Good luck to anyone trying to find a foundation match in that store. I would avoid this place like the plague. This convinced me once more that paying a bit/a lot more for a foundation in Douglas or ICI Paris is worth the money!",0,1
Kruidvat,The shops are always messy and dirty,"Update .You are ignoring me ion Facebook and in the email also on the phone . The shops are always messy and dirty , employees can’t speak Dutch or English or they don’t help when it’s needed .Webshop is pure lies . I ordered 2 days ago with the promise of getting it the day after . I still didn’t receive my order .They don’t have any information about when I get it . They don’t have a tracking system.When I wanted to just cancel my order and get my money back ( I paid for the order in advance) they told me it’s not possible.Right now I’m ripped off of my money and being played with .The best is that in the phone they don’t help , emails get ignored .

Kruidvat,Bad service,Bad service. I haven't been able to order online for more than 1.5 years. Supposedly there's a bug in the system that won't recognize my postal code. But I was able to order online before. Every time I contact customer support my emails get ignored or they tell me they're working on it. But I can't imagine that it takes so long to fix one simple error.Their physical stores aren't that great either. All of their items on sale are always out of stock and the lines are always insanely long.,0,1
Kruidvat,Racistic to the core,"Racistic to the core, customer-unfriendly, unrefined, underdeveloped company. This company DOES NOT treat it's non-white customers with respect. This is my FIRST-HAND experience - over and over again.Complaints to the store manager only deliver further argument, disrespect, threats and insults, instead of a simple apology (she does not even have the decency to say SORRY). And still worse - She was NOT sorry, at all! More intent on a fight, more enthusiastic to insult me and to prove me wrong! The aggressive and disrespectful behaviour of this store manager will be etched in my memory. I am extremely and deeply touched by this atrocity, this VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.I am going to fight for JUSTICE here - to the very end.I am going to write this bad review about Kruidvat at least in 10 places online, and also take it to the press in various countries.I will certainly be following up action against this BARBARIC company.I have saved my receipt and the name of the manager as well.I am determined to take serious action against this discriminatory barbaric behaviour.(This is NOT the first time - I have encountered exactly this same barbaric behaviour from this company in the past as well!!)Also - I have decided to boycott this company totally - there are so many better and cheaper alternatives online nowadays!",0,1
Kruidvat,product not in stock,"Hi.. sorry that I write in English... I have always been very happy with Kruidvat in every way.... I have been using a product for years. I mean like 5-6 or more years. Anyway, the last folder you advertised my product. Glucosamine, Chondroitine & MSM.. at a discount and even less if using points... I went to the Kruidvat in Heerlen, they didn't have the product anymore in stock.. Het Loon also not.. thought I would order online.. says product is out of stock... my complaint is simple.. why did you advertise a product... the one I wanted to buy ... that you don't have anymore.. I have looked at other druggist and they have at a different price...Will that product be coming back or not???Looking forward to getting an answer from you..
