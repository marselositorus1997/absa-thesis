Lidl Webshop,"Lost order, no refund, no solution, Lidl refuses to answer","I ordered a high pressure cleaner from Lidl, after I placed the order (bank payment page) was transferred to order confirmation page, but order number was not given. Confirmation email not received. Contacted the client service, they asked to wait 24 Hours! After 24 hours, no confirmation email received, also my Lidl account page shows no orders. Contacted client service again, the operator said that the order is lost, cannot be found or recovered. But told me a refund is possible in 10 days and advised to order again. After 3 days I ordered again, again the same story. Contacted client service again asked to wait 24 hours! after contacting 2nd person, she confirmed that order is lost again and offered refund after 10 days (if you read forums this is few months actually). I asked to contact other departments (like IT/technical), Lidl refused to provide any other help. They only indicate that the order is lost, but will investigate and if payment is made, will refund. Actually for 2nd case, they even don't commit a refund, even after I send my bank account transfer snapshot. Lidl refuses to investigate to find what went wrong and how in can be resolved.So if you ask me, never never try Lidl Webshop. Broken system, fraudulent ordering, unhelpful client service. The only thing you receive are expensive apologies and long waiting time on the phone. If you order expensive item, make sure you have legal assistance insurance to take legal action. So far I lost 210 euros on payments and 20 euros on phone.",0,1
Lidl Webshop,In a few days,"In a few days, it will be exactly one month from placing and paying for the order. After a previous comment, I was informed that someone would finally deliver the package. Until now, this has not happened, no one from DHL contacted, but the status has been changed to refund due to damage. I wonder who reported this damage, since no one from DHL showed up with the delivery ?! At this moment, I would like to get a refund because how long can you wait for a simple order?06.05.2021 ActualizationAccording to the information from you below, someone had to contact me regarding a refund because you no longer have this product and mine is damaged. Of course, no one has contacted, and now the DHL parcel status shows that today the courier will try to deliver the parcel again. So, will I receive a new set or has DHL repaired the old one? This is, of course, a rhetorical question. I don't want this order anymore, I want my money back.",0,1

Lidl Webshop,I like the products from Lidl and the…,"I like the products from Lidl and the prices are very affordable. Due to health issues, today for the first time, I ordered home delivery. I never received my groceries!! I called customer service and got someone in Virginia. I’m in South Carolina! I requested the groceries be delivered to the back deck. The driver claimed he couldn’t get to the deck! duh, maybe you’re at the wrong house? Nope, he just put the groceries in the driveway.....the customer service agent offered to refund my money to my credit card or Lidl account for my next order! Seriously, this order never arrived. Do you think you’ll get a second chance? In hour ago, I received an email where I’m being charged a tip! I requested a refund on the tip. There is no way I’ll reward a shopper for delivering my groceries to the wrong house!",0,1

Lidl Webshop,Delivery delay - No support,"Hello. It was the first time that I buy at the website of lidl shop but I would never buy anything there again. I bought a barbecue on April 10th. the delivery time written on the website was 5 days but up to now I didn't receive it, I tried to contact Lidl to solve the problem but the only answer they gave to me was that they dont know where my product is. Now, I'm trying to cancel my purchase to get my money back but again I'm not having a good support from Lidl. I hope my problem could be solved as soon as possible I look forward to hearing from youAdilson Simiao de Souza",0,1

Lidl Webshop,"Awesome web-shop BUT could be even better, if such a shop would show some appreciation for 'old good and generous buyers'!","As stated during the customer's survey and in order for me to provide Lidl ""5 stars"" the following lines of text must be taken into consideration:After having used Lidl web-shop for so long and after expending loads of money on Lidl's web-shop, I must say that I never saw Lidl providing me a token of such appreciation, for all those online orders, through the offering (for instance) of a promotional redeem voucher or any other discount code. I must state that I would definitely expect more in that field...I would be even satisfied, if delivery costs could be for free, if, for instance, a minimum of EUR 25 of ordered goods could be achieved in one order. Perhaps something to consider...",1,4
Lidl Webshop,Shipment Dates and Customer Support,"Delivery was one day later.

Lidl Webshop,Packages late or never come,"We've recently did our second order with Lidl web shop. The first time last year, the package was lost. Lidl had to ship again but this was more delay before we got the items.On the second order recently, package missing again. They sent it a second time, again not delivered. Now they have cancelled the order and the item we wanted is sold out. Very disappointing experience, used the webshop twice and both time there was problems with packages being delivered late or not at all. Avoid ordering with Lidl webshop unless you don't mind gambling if or when you will get what you ordered",0,1

Lidl Webshop,Online order silver crest eiren kooker,"Online order for a silver crest eiren kooker.3 working days to arrive. Over cooked the eggs even on the lowest setting.Returned and replaced within the week for no additional charge. A little better but still hard cooked on lowest setting. This time returned for refund.Refund received in full within 4 working days.Plus points. Returns are easy. Complete the included return note and stick the pre-paid DHL voucher onto the package and drop off at the collection point. Simple, free, minimal inconvenience.Minus points: Products are poor quality. Do not meet description and are consistently disappointing. Prices are then, not competitive to highly rated and reviewed 1st class product supplied from Amazon UK albeit it comes with a UK power connector but in the same time as the Lidl product.I applaud the refund and returns process. Poor product experiences lead me not to want to use again. 2*",0,2

Lidl Webshop,Delivery issues,"Ordered a mattress that was on promotion but they took time to deliver and had to chase up a few times. It sounds that either Lidl didn't have the mattress on stock, or like the communication between DHL and Lidl is not happening or they don't keep each other aware. Other than that, I like the quality of their stuffs so no issue then.",0,4

Lidl Webshop,Customer service really slow,"Customer service really slow. They tell you they will reply in 24 hours. I wrote them again 2 days later, and then they told me that everytime I write to them, my issue goes to the bottom of the queue ""resetting"" the 24 hour time. This is the worst garbage system I ever found. Not to mention that I ordered some balcony tiles, the delivery was late, I wasn't home anymore and half of them got returned (why half, don't ask me). Then the shop stopped selling those tiles, which leaves me a half finished balcony....",0,2

Lidl Webshop,"Good products, bad service","The garden tools I ordered are fine. Low-cost but reasonable quality.I was very disappointed with the ordering process. The delivery time changed from that advertised when I placed the order so something I was expecting within 48 hours took a lot longer.I bought the thing I needed elsewhere and emailed customer services immediately to cancel the order but it took them over a week to get back to me by which time the items had arrived. Two of the items I ordered came within 5 days but the main item, the one I actually needed, took much longer. I can’t tell you exactly how long as we were on holiday by this point. The delivery person left it on the doorstep in full view of everyone passing. It wasn’t stolen. Fortunately.I’m very disappointed with the service here.
