Lowe's Companies,NO STARS,"NO STARS! Rude, flip, not knowledgeable...that’s customer service at Lowe’s. Today is day 3 waiting for a delivery. When you call to complain they say...it’s not our fault, we use a 3rd party to deliver, you need to take it up w/them. Nice, right?!!! Pass the buck. 3rd day having to call customer care and even got a lady there w/a flip attitude...like I’m trying to get stuff for free. Evidently, they can’t figure discount either...one item I bought was $329 so 10% off is at least $30. I was told I’d receive 10% off my order & they are giving me $23 & change. There’s more in my order than just the one $329 item. 20 hours plus in phone calls, waiting during the days & times they said they were previously coming. Then they claim it wasn’t delivered because we weren’t home. If you’re told noon to 4 pm then that’s when I’m there. They came at 9 am!!! Time is money, ppl have jobs, time off work missed to sit & wait on Lowe’s when customer care says I do not have to be home. The store calls & says they won’t deliver until they know I’m home and they hear back from me. Right hand doesn’t talk to left hand clearly. Just ridiculous! I could write a book between the 2 deliveries in a year from Lowe’s. Best advice...go to Home Depot!! I scheduled 2 deliveries w/them the same day as Lowe’s. 6 days later, still waiting on Lowe’s that was supposed to come Weds. My deliveries from Home Depot...delivered on the days & times they said. Delivery driver was very nice, polite & professional, clean & spoke clear English. That’s how you do business Lowe’s!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Do not buy appliances at Lowes,Do not buy appliances at Lowes. They sell inferior quality products from my experiences with both a convection microwave I had them install and then a dishwasher. The microwave burned out entirely within a year. The dishwasher latch failed within 6 months and now I must have that repaired. The last straw was when I bought blinds yesterday and the cords were irreparably tangled in manufacture.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,I have never dealt with such rude,"I have never dealt with such rude, lying, racist people in my life, and I am white. The store manager is the only one who made things right. You call and they hang up on you, so my wife goes up there multiple times. All this after buying an $800 dryer and it lasted a grand total of 3 cycles. 2+ weeks later they bring a replacement after we were lied to about requesting a replacement. These people don't even know anything about what their selling. Which dryer is better...Uuuuuuu what's a dryer? $800 with extended warranty and nobody would help us. Josh was the store manager and he was extremely helpful. The other ""managers"" so called, don't want to do anything. An appliance ""associate"" was supposed to put in for a replacement, and didn't, went so far as to call the next day and confirm it and then lied about it ""audibly"" in the background to the store manager. I have spent so much money there, I couldn't begin to count it. Nobody want's to work or do what they are supposed to. You could tell they have no interest in helping you whatsoever. I will NEVER spend my hard earned money in the North Winston-Salem, North Carolina store again. I work like a dog and these people treat you like....what do you want? Thank you Josh for your help. The only one who works in that store apparently. Home Depot is looking really good from where I am with these people. Just had the new dryer installed. Wondering how long it will last. Had to hang out clothes on a clothes line for 2+weeks. I wished I could attach a picture. Looks like the Beverly Hillbilliy's in the back yard. Freaking ridicoulous.",0,1

Curbside pickup seriously needs to be streamlined. Waited in car for 35 mins? And after 35 mins, i called the number again, only to be informed that there seems to be an issue with the order.. why couldn't they just call back and tell me? Second call- they kept me on hold for another 10minutes .. I gave up and went inside to find out what's going on, and after another 5 minutes of wait, I was told that they can't find my stuff and I need to come back again!!I would have appreciated if they called up after 15 mins and told me that they can't find my stuff. very disrespectful of peoples time!

Yes I waited but didn’t get me anywhere.the total time was 1 hour 34 min. 😠 was told it was shipped on Tuesday to the store and showed to be delivered 5/7 and suggest I wait to call Monday 5/10 to see if arrived. Of course I called today Friday 5/7 I did just pick it up and the flipping ticket says date received 5/6..🤬. absolutely no reason for them to not have delivered to me today!! I suggest if you buy and they tell you 2-7 days to ship to store to not go by that. That date is not accurate!!!!! Don’t be like me and get rid of your perfect working stove the week the new one is supposed to be in to only be stuck without one..... I would rather be told it’s not gonna be in for a month, keep what I have, then be called with hey we got your order in early!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Horrible is an understatement,"Horrible is an understatement. We have been looking for our doors delivery which was scheduled for 2 weeks ago and rescheduled twice. They didn’t deliver any of the 3 times although we had to wait at home from 7am-7pm to receive them. Can’t reach anyone at the store or at their 800 numbers. Their automated system eventually transfers to a 3rd party who handles their deliveries, yet knows nothing about your status. Save yourself the headache and time, and never order any deliveries from them. They’re too disorganized to be considered seriously.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,"Terrible Customer Service, Unreliable Delivery Service, Not Trustworthy","Ordered a product online, Lowes delivery service attempted delivery to the wrong address, the resident at that wrong address declined delivery, and they will cannot reschedule delivery. I was on hold for 2 hours with customer service before I was able to speak to someone, and after dozens of attempts at calling the San Francisco store no one answers.A few times I heard a associate pick up and leave the phone off the hook intentionally.From this point on I cannot in good conscience recommend Lowe’s to anyone. I have yet to figure out if or how I can receive my product, or how to get my $500 dollars back, $95 of which was for Delivery. Lowe’s in my opinion is no longer a trustworthy and reliable company.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes customer service has gone down the toilet.,First we couldn't find an flower pot then we couldn't find an employee and when I went to return an item they was rude as can be when I got the replacement we stood in the selfserve checkout for more then 10 minutes waiting for assists for a bolt we needed this is the last time I shop at Lowes we will go across the street to home depot they are friendly and value their customers,0,1

When I got there to pick up the items the staff could not find it. I went back later and still they couldn't find it. For the inconvenience the manager offered me a $100 credit which I never got. Eventually they delivered it for free. I also ordered an accessory that the previous item needs in order to operate. I received an email that item was in. This time I called instead of wasting time in case it wasn't there like last time. Unfortunately this time was like the last; it wasn't there. They said that I'd be notified when it came in but that never happened. I called again and was told that they don't know what happened to it and that I can reorder it. I canceled the item and ordered it from Home Depot. This is absolutely unacceptable! Also, the sales associates in the store are very disrespectful, not just in my current issue.",0,1

Yeah this will be the last order I made from Lowe’s and just to be clear are used to work for the number one Lowe’s store in my region in North Carolina we would’ve never ever ever thought of greeting customers like this and making up bull excuses for why the shipments haven’t gone. They took the money off my card right away before it even shipped and now it’s getting intercepted because I don’t want it and I don’t get the money back even though they know they’re getting their item back I don’t get the money back until they get the item back 7 to 10 days after they get the item back.

Lowe's Companies,We had our refrigerator fail...,"We had our refrigerator fail on a Friday (4/30/21) evening. I was working that night, so couldn't do much until Saturday morning. Decided to buy a replacement online rather than go into the store after working all night. All seemed to go well, paid, set up delivery for Sunday morning. Saturday afternoon, got a text to confirm the delivery which I did. Sunday morning, received a text saying the delivery truck was about 15 minutes away. An hour later, I get a call from the local Lowe's store informing me that they didn't have stock of the refrigerator I purchased and it would be later in the week before they could get another from the warehouse. Even though it showed in stock, and all was fine beforehand. I'm fairly certain what happened is someone came in later in the day needing a refrigerator and they sold the one that was supposed to be delivered to me. This is the second time Lowe's has screwed up an order. And it has been the store (Hickory, NC) not the delivery service both times. The last time I ordered something, they called because they were out of stock of one item. I said to take that item off the order & send me everything else. So they cancelled the entire order (over $300). Now, I still don't have a refrigerator.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,This company is the absolute worst.,This company is the absolute worst.The online order shows a quick delivery date and then when you check out its a week later - can you say bait and switch?The ironic thing is the CEO of Lowes is a Member of the Board of Directors of Fedex who is the company not making timely delivery.If you are a tradesman and need materials on a timely basis DO NOT TRUST LOWES OR FEDEX,0,1

Lowe's Companies,delivery Didn’t come on promised date or rescheduled date,"I ordered two bath vanities on April 22 with a promised delivery date of April 25 which came and went. When I was able to finally speak to a person which took me an hour and a half on hold they told me to just reschedule the delivery and cool that particular store the day before the delivery. I did that and I do have to say whoever I spoke with in the company was quite lovely. Well I rescheduled for May 4 and called on May 3 in the morning as directed, when they assured me that it would be on that delivery. Well guess what? It never arrived. So this morning May 5 I called back up that stores delivery department and spoke to a wonderful sounding gentleman who now told me that it was not in stock! He is trying to find if he could find these items to send to the store near me but meanwhile this is holding up our construction project and our ability to use this new addition which is quite frustrating.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Years of bad customer service,"I've had a string of bad experiences. Recently, tried to return a broken part for replacement and it has been 4 weeks of a runaround and no part. I am now calling the manufacturer direct to replace it. I ordered pine staff one afternoon and was directed to a trailer at the end of the parking lot to wait to load my vehicle. I waited 30 minutes and called Lowes on my cell to get someone to help me. Another incident occurred when I ordered a product for pickup. When I stopped by for pickup, the employee told me there was a mistake with inventory and they had none in the store. Why didn't then email or call me? I then had to go through very unfriendly customer service desk to get my money back an item they didn't fill. Instead of getting money, they forced me to get a paid in a gift card. I could go on and on. Unfortunately, their store is the only home improvement store in my town.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Tech support,"Until last year I ( single 69 year old woman) did not know which end of a screw driver was the working end. With minimal money and the world falling in on my head, I resorted to do it yourself home projects. Youtube and Lowes tech support allowed me to reside a shed, build a deck and a handicapped ramp. strip a cedar shake roof from a shed that I wanted to turn into a summer kitchen and then reroof it. I then needed a breaker box in the shed and install 220 to run the summer kitchen stove. I installed all new lighting. Since I had no clue what I needed, I brought lots of pictures and Lowes associates walked me through my shopping list and told me how to do it. Yesterday my water heater went out. I walked into Lowes with confidence, asked for a babysitter for my shopping experience and today I have hot water. Lowe's should be proud of their employees, If I can do this, anyone can.",0,5

We checked in at the pick-up counter and waited 20-30 minutes and then were told that the order could not be found. We asked that the order be delivered to the house but have not received a confirmation for that action. The next day I called the store to get clarification on the status of our order but can't get in touch with a representative to determine the next step. No one answers the phone and you wait indefinitely. I checked the order status online but it stated they could not find the order. During another effort by phone to get the status of the order, it stated that order had been picked up, which is obviously incorrect. Very poor performance overall. Sad though, I quit using HD for similar reasons.",0,1

Don’t worry, you won’t be charged for any canceled items."") I didn't cancel it and my payment was not declined, which means I was allowed to purchase something that was out of stock and that's messed up. I found two good sales prices for the item I wanted, one from Lowe's and another store. Me trying to be a loyal customer went with Lowe's only to be allowed to purchase an item that's out of stock and have my order canceled. And the sales are over, so now I'm screwed. I was not offered no type of alternative. That's just bad business! It may not seem like a big deal, but it is because I suffer from severe chronic back pain and it's been hell getting up from a mattress on the floor and times have been tough, I finally catch a sale and am able to purchase a platform to get my mattress off the floor and boom! order canceled and the sales are over.

Lowe's Companies,WARNING,"WARNING! Steer clear of LOWES Home Improvement for your Counter-Top.I would not have purchased my granite kitchen countertop from LOWES if I knew what a disaster it would turn out to be.LOWES contracted the job to a third party fabricator - Stone Systems - who created and installed my countertop and did an extremely shoddy job of it! I don't know why a reputable store such as LOWES is doing business with this place but they really need to stop.I purchased a granite countertop on January 23rd from LOWES. After many needless delays, it was finally installed nearly 3 months later. But the issue isn't the delay. In fact, there are SEVERAL issues! First, the job was a total shoddy one from the start. ---- The stone was carelessly cut with no regard for the pattern. Therefore, the pieces DO NOT BLEND AT THE SEAMS!---- My sink had a soap dispenser. I asked that the granite be cut to ensure that the dispenser hole would be covered. It was not. So now there is a huge hole on my sink where the dispenser was!---- They SWITCHED the stone slabs that I had picked out from their storage place and REPLACED it with an INFERIOR one that I had rejected due to it having RED SPLATTERS throughout. So basically, my countertop looks like someone SPLATTERED RED SAUCE all over it.--The Project Manager at Stone Systems is unwilling to rectify the situation to my satisfaction. I have stressed my issues with him and included photos as evidence of my claims. He was to speak to his ""boss"" and get back to me. It's been so much time since we last spoke on this issue and I'm still waiting to hear back.",0,1

It's showing me that it's at the store today so I called, and was told that the receiver's as left already so now I have to wait for the next day that my man has to work to go get it. I'm not happy cause I pick for it to be deliver the next day when I order it and it's been a week now. I will not recommend ordering online for it to be deliver to store if your not willing to wait for almost 2 weeks. It's misleading to give the next day delivery and the customers can not get their item, at less the day after I can be ok with that. So I'll be checking tomorrow for my TV stand, I should be able to pick up. Also when I got the FedEx tracking number it show it was coming from the east side of the United States, that explain why it took so long and still not cool cause it said I can pick the next day delivery.",0,2

I spend more than $6000 at both Homedepot and Lowes for this project and Homedepot never give me any problems for a store credit when I can not find my original receipts. This is rediculous.

Lowe's Companies,Disappointing experience with trying to purchase a lawn edger,"I went to Lowe's on Oakland Park Blvd in Oakland Park, Florida today. I had researched top ranking lawn edgers and saw they carried the one I wanted. To my surprise it had a sale sign noting it was reduced from $219 to $199. I took that along with some premixed 2 cycle fuel and went to the self checkout. The item rang up $219. I brought it to the attention of the sales clerk and was told I needed to go to a regular checkout. I did and then advised by that sales associate that I needed to go and take a picture of the sales sign. I went and did that. The sales sign was way high up. She looked at it, enlarged it on my phone. Then said a manager needed to ok the reduction. Mind you the store wasn't busy but it sure took a long time to get a manager. She came. By then I had a chance to look at the sign, enlarged it and saw that it was on sale through 4/30. Today was 5/1. I asked the manager if she would honor the sales price since there was a sign noting and no way for anyone to see the effective dates. Felt they should have given they taken down the sign. I would had paid the $219. Since I had much time. I looked at saw they had in on sale on Amazon for $199. She said no to giving it to me for that price. She seemed indifferent to me, grabbed the item and went to put it back on the shelf. No wonder people just skip the brick and mortar stores and go to Amazon. They make it easy and you don't need to be irritated by indifferent sales associates.",0,1

I was wrong.My two neighbors on both sides of my house and I decided to get a privacy fence. We paid Lowes for the Fence in August 2020. They told us they wouldn't be able to install until April 2021. Given the current state of the economy, we accepted this and moved forward with lowes. After waiting 9 months with no communication on the part of Lowes, I decided to contact the lowes sales person to see when we should be expecting the fence to be installed. He told me that he doesn't have anything to do with the fence after he sells it and gave me the number to the installer. The installer told me that they haven't even scheduled our installation yet because the drawing done by the sales person was rejected by the city. I then have to call the salesman back and let him know of his mistake. After 9 months, all of this should have been taken care of at this point. He comes back to my house, re-measures, and informs me that he has to wait for back ordered materials now. Because I complained to the installers, they decided to install the rest of the fencing and wait on the portion in my yard that was delayed. The second issue I had presented itself when the installers hit an internet line. Long story short they tried to make me believe it was my fault and I would be receiving a bill. When I spoke with the internet technician that came to fix it, he informed me that it had nothing to do with me. That the installers knew they were supposed to hand dig within so many feet of the line, and they were using an auger. The third issue: On installation day they inform me that they cannot install the fence on my side of the property line due to a tree that is encroaching on the neighbors property. After 9 months of waiting and now they tell me this? I had to pay an additional $900 last minute to have this tree removed.At this point I was angry. I talked to the salesman, and informed him that this was all ( the delay in materials and permits, and now the tree situation) due to his negligence. He was EXTREMELY rude, got loud with me and said that nothing is his fault and it doesn't help anyone to place blame. The fact that he couldn't apologize and take responsibility for things that were clearly due to his lack of due diligence was really disappointing. Fourth issue:After the tree has been removed AND I received the backordered materials for the remaining part of my fence, I still have no expected date for them to finish the fence. I called the installers on Monday April 26th, informed them that the tree has been removed and I have the rest of the materials. They told me they would get back to me. I did not hear from them so I called again on Friday April 30th, again they said they would get back to me. Meanwhile I have 3 small dogs and I cannot let them out into my yard.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Only takes 1 incident to change from good to bad,"Order # “0003492249” and a Tracking # “786350630073”. Lawn Mower did not arrive. Another package address to someone else arrived. Long waiting delays when I called Customer Service. 3 hang ups which caused a very lengthy frustrating waiting delay. Best was to leave my call number and they called back just under 1 hour later. Best was to open conversation please note my phone number and call me back if we get disconnected. This worked. Lowe's Policy. Wants my 74 year old mom to take this heavy wrong delivered package to a UPS. Send it to a Lowe's. Yes no actual address. Take pictures of the package and note the Tracking #. After about a 4 week investigation. Maybe the $ 507.37 visa payment will be reimbursed. Then mom can go back on Lowe's On-line and re order the Lawn Mower. I suggested Lowe's deliver the Lawn Mower and then pick up the wrong delivered package. This is not an option as Lowe's is ""missing a Lawn Mower"". So now this is my problem. These experts in the field make the mistake and the customer gets the gears. Final offer from the pros here; They (Lowe's) will e-mail mom shipping labels. Mom calls UPS with a given phone number. No longer required to take pictures of the wrong delivered package. UPS arrives, mom notes the Tracking number. Mom waits up to 4 weeks for the ""investigation"". Maybe the $ 507.37 will be reimbursed. Then mom can go order another Lawn Mower on-line with Lowe's. <- This is the final option. Here is the kicker; no shipping labels sent, no other information. No call back or follow call from Lowe's. I submitted an on-line complaint also with Lowe's the other day, all quiet, no follow up from Lowe's. I called my Bank Visa disputes (on hold for an hour there too, new norm I guess). Bank set a date May 15, 2021 to see if this can be resolved. Looking like I have to wait until May 15. - All mom wanted was a Lawn Mower, I paid for it. Lowe's has caused us time and inconvenience, frustration. Also, the unknown? This is going to take up allot more of our time and the solution is to now get a full refund. Looks like Lowe's will not make this easy. Thank you for reading. John (Hamilton).",0,1

When I recieved my confirmation Email it said the same date. Then 2 days later my tracking Email said longer delays due to excessive orders for pickup. Then at that time the tracking just stopped tracking. On the 30th I called the store in Turlock,Ca because I never received a notification. The store said not there due to delays. I call customer service for online orders at 1-800-445-6937 and waited for 1hour 5 minutes, then gave up. Chat bot/incompetent people have no idea where the truck is, and wont find out for you.I call Turlock Lowes again and they looked it up for me again. This time the shipping department at Turlock Lowes says its on a FedEx truck trying to blame it on FedEx when Lowes is telling everyone on their site when the products will arrive without telling everyone before they order the correct day within 4 days,or that there are delays as in my Email 2 days after ordering. Worst customer service. All companies tell people all of the time when they cant deliver is Covid,Covid,Covid!!!! Most other companies get it there on time, or the next day like Amazon,Ebay,HomeDepot etc....... The reason you people are late with the orders that you cant deliver on is because your online shipping has horrible tracking and nobody tells customers online that delays even exist. This is because if Lowes stated this before people order, they will buy elsewhere and they know it.",0,1

On November 9th 2020 we purchased a washer and dryer. The washer was in stock and we took it with us that day. We were told the dryer would need to be ordered and would arrive the end of December or the beginning of January. We were ok with that. It is now April 29, 2021 and they are telling us it will at least September. To say the least we asked for a refund. But we also punched the extended warranty on both appliances at the time of purchase (11/20). Of course we asked for a portion of that to be refunded also. Oh no we have to request that on our own. Remember we paid Lowe’s for all this at the time of purchase. Now the part of Lowe’s that offers the warranty will not allow us to only purchase the portion for the washer, they can only cancel the whole agreement. And to top it all off not allowed to purchase one for the washer because it is pass thirty days. Anyone reading through all this buy local. We went and purchased the exact same dryer from a local business today 4/29 It is the exact same dryer that we have been waiting for, for FIVE months.

Now you have the added expenses of buying the same appliance you purchased a few years ago but now it's gone up in price, pay for delivery and pay for hauling off the bad appliance.

Totalitarian. Understaffed to hell and so willing to screw new hires over. It's absolutely no wonder why customers leave any bad reviews about lack of customer service or even finding an associate within a store who knows a single thing about anything because it is a constant rotating door of employees. Nevermind forklifters who can be there on a moments notice, ive seen a customer use the forklift himself to get product down (i do not condone this but was too late to do anything, he was successful). Lowe's and other retailers have these fancy corporate structures that leave regular and seasonal associates at the bottom rung for respect no matter how useful of an idiot they were for this comany.

Lowe's Companies,This is the worst customer service I…,This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I placed an order for 3 appliances weeks ago as I needed it delivered to my rental property by the end of the month. The website showed these items as available. I just got a text that my order is being rescheduled 2 months out. I called customer service and was told ALL 3 items are not in stock. Why did the Lowes.com website show delivery when you did not have the items? Beware of your lowe's bad marketing policies.,0,1

Lowe's Companies,Placing an order to be delivered,Placing an order to be delivered. A week before it was needed I thought would be enough time to get it when I needed. After paying for the merchandise was informed it would be delivered two weeks later. Told the sales person it was needed before noon. Was told no problem. Two days before the delivery I went in to make sure it would be delivered on time. Was informed it would be delivered in the right day but would get there when it got there. So could not get the delivery when needed so had to postpone the job for two weeks then informed it would show uo whenever.This is not how to get things done. Three weeks after ordering and then whenever it shows up? Customers get upset when they are told one thing and that doesn't happen. Lowes think about your customers and the people they are working for. How about You explain why a job can't be done on time.,0,1

The people I got our last fridge from were very responsible. This group made excuses to not bring it in. They didn't prepare, didn't even have proper equipment. They should have looked at manifest before leaving, better training and more questions should be asked by sales to better prepare drivers and better training for drivers on how to do they're job and how to trouble shoot they're job. We are truck drivers as well this is very poor planning on everybody's part. I blame managers for this.",0,1

Lowe's offers a truck rental service. But the procedure stucks. They only have 1 truck available at the store. A gentleman in front of me rented the truck. We were literally in the store buying our items and they would not let us reserve the one and only truck. We bought 4 buggy full of outdoor items, we decided to wait for the truck. The gentleman had a 90 minute rental. We sat there for 2 1/2 hours in the sun by our plants. They need a minuum of two trucks and a fair reserve system. We finally said heck with their truck and made 3 car loads back and forth. I'm very disappointed in Lowe's!",1,1
Lowe's Companies,One of the worst experiences ever,"One of the worst experiences ever. Purchased a microwave and 5 year service contract from Lowe's just over a year ago. Product failed and they sent out a tech to verify that yes in fact it was no longer working. That's when things started to get bad. It's a long story but basically they charged me to go out and re-measure the cabinet opening (even though they already had the prior measurement sheet), then they took weeks and weeks to do anything to help find a replacement. Then after searching around they came to the conclusion that they had nothing in stock and couldn't get anything for another roughly 6 months. Amazing. How about the support from their service contract team? Couldn't have been worse. I'll never shop Lowe's again...for anything. Absolutely one of the most time wasting, frustrating experiences ever.",0,1

In addition to the AO Smith warranty; 12 years; I purchased an additional extended warranty from Lowes for 5 years. I called, waited 58 minutes to get an agent, was told to call American Water Heater company that they are the ones that manage Lowes extended warranty. I was given a ticket number and a local contractor they use. Of course the contractor said that they did not have anyone available until next week since it was Friday 1:30 PM, now the kicker if I agree to paying $200.00 an hour for overtime guess what, they all of a sudden have a tech that can go to my property on Saturday morning at 10:00 AM. Now 90 minutes later I get a call and guess what he can be in my property in 40 minutes. The moral of the story is never buy anything from Lowes and never buy an extended warranty from them, you will get better service from the mafia and it will cost you less. By the way in 40 plus years of being a home owner and owner of multiple rental properties, I have never had a water heater fail in six months, nor ever heard of one breaking down in such a short period of time, great job AO Smith even the Chinese crap that gets imported does better than that.",0,1

When I did so, it directed me back to the exact store, not allowing me to book with another store location. I had to call the store to book the reservation- and then the day of the appointment no one showed up.

Suffice to say i waited 4 months for kitchen cabinets that i bought because they were supposed to be in stock. After many delays the big day finally comes and i’m told i’ll get an email or call with a time for delivery but of course that never came. I called to find out if it was still coming. The first call i was on hold for 10 minutes until i hung up The second call rang forever and no one ever answered. The third call i got “deliveries” which before anyone could help me i got cut off . The 4th call i got the same guy who said his computer crashed. After 10 min he asked if he could check and call me back. Even rinky dink companies can contact someone and give them a 2-3 hour time frame for a delivery but apparently that’s above Lowes ability I’m stunned at how inept this company is. I’ve been waiting 7 hours and you guessed it still no call. If i hadn’t waited 4 months i would cancel everything and start over. Still waiting. Be very careful. Also i’ve really not liked some of Lowes policies. I know i only spent close to 20,000 dollars and all paid up front and still felt like they wouldn’t give me any information until their policies were met. Example ipaid around 14,000 for kitchen cabinets and quartz counter tops but the day i did this i left the store with nothing but a pencil drawing by the sales person. No 3d drawing to show what i bought and it just goes on from there. Really sad as they have some excellent sales people but the back en and policies are just mind bending. Omg. I just got the call back and was told yes it’s still coming and will be there before 5. So i guess they just expect you to sit and wait from 8am to whenever it gets there no update no window just wait for up to 9 hours. Really regretting this whole ordeal. Dave Buckthorp Burnby BC",0,1

It wasn't until we called and asked where our order was that this error was discovered. After the error was discovered, we were told that the gazebo would be delivered the next day. This also did not happen and I was told that instead of delivering it to me they ""accidently"" sold the gazebo to someone else even though it was supposed to be marked sold! Now I am told that I would have to wait another month to get the item that I should have received weeks ago! This is by far the worst customer support that I have ever dealt with!

Lowe's Companies,Got my money - I get broken granite for it! Looking for QUALITY workmanship? Go elsewhere. Too bad you can't load photos on this site.,"Dec 1, 2020 - Installers arrived late afternoon 3:30 informing me that they had been trying to contact me for three hours, that my voicemail message stated I was not home. I asked what number they were calling since I am working at home, and wondering when they were going to show. The plumber (Lowes- contractor) had arrived that morning and was waiting to hear from me about the sink re-install once they completed the job. The installers dialed my phone while the three of us stood in the living room and it rang immediately. Installation process began, they found the backsplash was not cut (according to them) while installing the countertops they pointed out to me that the veining/pattern did not flow like it should have. I overlooked this, went with it. What am I going to do at this point? I was surprised when a slab was brought in without the sink area precut as the area had been laser measured in Nov. It was cut in the kitchen with the fine granite dust bellowing throughout the house, granite dust on every item, throughout the 1300 sq ft. I overlooked this, although the cloud hung for a while and the installer apologized and mentioned maybe his vac was not working. While we both stood there in a fog of dust.Dec 18, 2020 - Installers returned with partial backsplash which they installed. I asked about the gap between the backsplash and the wall and if they could run a bead or something to finish that off. I was told - it is the wall, although the old ones they removed fit to the wall. I overlooked this.Jan 18th, 2021 - I contacted Lowes’s point of contact (who stated he did not have notes on it) and inquired when my installation would be completed? He contacted Signature Granite, who in turn contacted me, and told me they could come out on Jan 25th of Jan 29th. I told her I was not available but was available on Jan 22. She replied she would have to get with them and see if they could reschedule. I never heard from Signature Granite to confirm any date - installers happened to call on Jan 22 in route for installation.Jan 22,2021 - Installers arrived and installed the last of backsplash while re-epoxying the seam at the sink where they had pieced the granite together - it had broken, I mentioned this to Lowes during the conversation on the 18th.April 1,2021 - While working at my kitchen office, I noticed a dip in the counter area of the sink, checked it out and there is a crack, it appears to be at a stress point. I contacted Lowes and received an email stating it is no longer their issue. I promptly called Lowes, the manager was out and spoke with a store associate while asking him if he could speak for the manager. Yes, he replied.Note – in Nov I sent a letter to the store manager sharing my appreciation for the two saleswoman who set the process in motion. Although one was new, I showed patience and at one time I even said “Oh, with this issue (for me to coordinate a plumber) I told her this will not work as it is very difficult to locate a plumber let alone get one to arrive when the installers will”. But she and her supervisors went another route and got me set up. Lowes sub- contacts work out. April 6, 2021 – Lowes called and re epoxy is the name of the game. Signature Granite will be in touch with me. How nice. The fact that no one bother to assess it in person and now that the whole 12 inches from the man-made seam to the crack is loose. To have GRANITE crack (the brochure claims durability and then Signaturer Granite informs Lowes it does crack) which was completed only for 2 months and 1 week? I find it unsatisfactory. I realize there is a boom in home improvements over the last year but I don't think it should entail shoddy and inefficient methods in order to ""get a sale"". Plus, the fact that Lowes did not follow up with a call to ask if I were satisfied with the project after knowing there were issues, is inexcusable. April 15, 2020- Signature Granite called - They will schedule an appointment for re epoxy fix.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Never Ordering from Lowes Again,"I just bought a house two months ago, and already Lowes has dropped the ball twice. I first ordered a chandelier, and was told it be delivered a week later. A week later, no chandelier, we called Lowes and their response was ""Sorry we don't know where it is"". Fast forward another week, still no chandelier, and Lowes is still claiming they know nothing. About the delivery from Lowes. That they are in charge of. At that point, we were about to just buy a different one and demand a refund from Lowes. We called and told them that and suddenly they had the info and told us they were working on it. Another week passes, it has now been 3 and a half weeks since we were told it would be delivered and finally it shows up without notification. Now I figured well maybe it was just a fluke, so we ordered our new refrigerator from Lowes. Within a few days of ordering, it's been delayed two months. Fine, with COVID that's expected. A week later I get a call from the Delivery company informing me that the fridge will be arriving tomorrow between 8am and 12pm. Skeptical, I called them back and verified with a representative that indeed it would be coming tomorrow. A bit annoying to have such little notice but at least it was coming early. Got up early the following day, moved a bunch of furniture to make room for them to walk the fridge in. 12pm comes and goes, no fridge. No phone call form anyone updating me on anything. Called the delivery company back, suddenly they can't find my order and claim they have the wrong number for me so there's no way they could have called me the previous day, as I was calling back the number that had called me directly. They were no help and told me to call Lowes.

I was told the glass had a crack and needed to be returned to the manufacturer. At this point, my wife and I were done waiting. We are not sure how reliable the 3rd door is going to be and requested for a refund. Lowes need to ensure projects are run efficiently to ensure customer satisfaction.

Lowe’s delivered a used mower that has 2.5 hours of use on it and it was dirty and scratched up it had been used to cut grass and I assume returned. I called the main Lowe’s number they gave me a case number and told me the store that the mower was shipped from, Lowe’s in Trussville, Alabama would contact me. I have been trying for four days to call them and they don’t answer the phone. The main Lowe’s number even tried without success. This is the worst example of customer service that I have ever experienced. The main Lowe’s customer service has emailed the store manager and I still have no response. Today is the fourth day I have been trying to call them. 205-655-9725 if you want to try for yourself. I ordered a new mower and they shipped a used mower and I can’t get in touch with anyone to resolve it. If I get this resolved I don’t think I will ever use Lowe’s again.",0,1

I immediatly called the store, and spoke to someone in the Millwork dept who had ZERO answered and I was told I would get a call back the next day. I waited all day - no phone call. I called the store again and was connected to the same person who helped me the previous day. He preceeded to tell me that the vender FORGOT TO SHIP IT!!! I was promised another call back AND a call from the vender, which never happened. I called the store a 3rd time and was told by a Supervisor that the vender was within their shipping agreement and it would now be delivered on 4/30. Frustrated, I went to the store to speak with a manager. After FINALLY tracking someone down that could help me, he called the manager on a walkie talkie and she REFUSED TO SPEAK WITH ME!!!HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I ordered a washer and dryer from Lowes…,"I ordered a washer and dryer from Lowes in Lewisville. I had to first wait 20 min for a sales person and then placing the order was ok once he came. The problem is when it came time to deliver it, they didnt notify us when there was a problem with the order. We called and the claimed it was lost then they driver said it was not on the truck. This is by far the worse experience at a department store. I am hoping they realize that breach of contract or fraud would apply here as they knew they would not either be abble to deliver it or did not want to honor the salespersons scheduling. Either way LOWES has seen the last of me anywhere on the planet and I hoping hey are not gonna talk 5 to 7 day refund bs. I should have went to HOME DEPOT like I planned. You ruined my anniversary.

Lowe's Companies,Awful Lowes' Appliance Delivery Experience!,"We had a refridgerator deilvered and it was a horrible experience. They were half hour late AFTER the 4 hour window they gave us (7-11am on a SUNDAY MORNING!). I had to ask one of the guys to ""put his mask back on"" a dozen times while they were IN our house! One of the guys walked in and the first thing his did was dump his filthy tool bag on my kitchen counter - not the floor, but the counter!!!!! They left trash (styrofoam) all over the street in front of our house. They did not install things properly and my husband had to pull the fridge back out after they left and do it himself (after we PAID for it!). They were in such a hurry to get out of our house because they said they were going to play baseball, they left some of their tools behind. I immediately called them after they left to come back for them but they wouldn't answer the phone! 2 VERY awful delivery ""BOYS"" who couldn't care less about our home or safety.

I don’t have vehicle to haul the table back and my local store doesn’t have the table, that is why I ordered online and had it delivered. I also spoke to the store manager in Florence, KY. Jim told me the table could be picked up in two weeks and I would get a credit once it was back in the store. No attempt to replace the table or make it right. I just want the undamaged table I bought for $1K. Now what?? Guess I will try Home Depot. Individual customers mean very little to Lowe’s. They just don’t care. Too bad.",0,1

I am 63, not a weakling, but it would have been nice to be offered some help. I called the store to voice my concerns on how to do better. I have now talked to two managers and put a phone call into the store manager who never bothered to return my call. I can see just little ol me jumping ship and going to Home Depot from now on won't break their bank. Still it would have been nice to be treated like I mattered. A gal in customer service offered me 10% off my next purchase. Well that would be great if I was buying a frig. Customer service is not what I expected.

At the store took one customer service person over 15 mins to return one piece of trim that another customer was returning with a receipt. Envisioning why this queue took so long? Finally get the tool set and take home, open and discover duplicate socket with the next size socket missing. Call Lowe's customer service. 1 hr hold. then 1 hr with a service rep who I explained what happened and kindly asking can they send me the missing part which they sell separately. Tool set sold out so can't return and get another. Thought the $3.48 part should be able to be sent free and call over. Nope. No way they would do that. Took 1 hr with the rep and waiting while she put me on hold to research or speak to someone else.

The 4 hours came and went. We called to try and get an update. We were then told that our delivery was bumped to the next 4 hour block of time 4:00-8:00 pm. That window came and went. Called down to customer service and were told that hey didn't have record of our order and we needed to call back during regular business hours to talk to Delivery Manager. The next morning after trying for 3 hours, finally got the manager on the phone only to be told that the refrigerator was delivered the day before but she couldn't tell me where. Obviously not to the correct address. Now waiting on a call back to see what the next step is. Lowe's has really fallen off the customer service train. They don't care about the customer.

When I finally reached a human being on a Lowe's 800 number - after repeated unanswered calls to the store number and after the Lowe's website said it had no information - I was told, oops, my Lowe's store hadn't even received the merchandise I ordered two weeks before and it would be another two weeks before they could make delivery.When the washer and dryer did arrive on the new date, I was told, oops, these were European machines that couldn't be installed in the US. The delivery guys said, yep, this is the kind of stuff they see Lowe's do all the time. And when I called the store to complain, Lowe's blamed me for ordering European machines, which seemed odd to me since (1) the Lowe's website, which was so happy to get my credit card information, said nothing about non-US compliant merchandise, (2) I ordered from the Lowe's store in Brooklyn, (3) for delivery to a Brooklyn address, and (4) the new machines are to replace old (US compliant) machines made by the same European manufacturer. The guy didn't even apologize.Bottom line: never buy a major appliance from Lowe's",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Rude manager!,"I just visited the Lowe’s at Grey Lag Way, in Lexington,Ky. The cashier had to leave and get the manager (a lady with long blonde hair) to get bills for my change. When they returned, after approx. 5mins the manager acted as though she was extremely aggravated. She pushed down on my hand as she put the change in my hand and said nothing! Her and the cashier just went about discussing how they were gonna count for the change they were putting in the drawer as I stood there in disbelief. After a few mins I took my bag and left.

When the door was picked up from the store it was not in a box or protected from being damaged. Unfortunately the spouse did not check before wrapping in blankets to get it home. When we went to hang the door, wood is chipped, door (solid wood) is dented, and it was filthy with bugs and dirt stuck to the tape and it looks like the door was assembled over the glass tape rather than removing the tape. We paid just under $400 for this door and expected a pristine door in good condition. Seriously will impact future major purchases.",0,3

I've called Lowes and FedEx multiple times only to get a different version of when I would be able to cancel the order or file a lost package complaint. Also, 3 hrs after my online order, my card was compromised and the card was canceled due to fraudulent activity by my bank. Now I must wait 14 business days to cancel my order, 14-21 days to receive a refund and they cant refund my order because the card was canceled!!! And the online customer help representatives are so incredibly rude and unhelpful!!!! I'm now out $113.00 and out a set of lamps.

Once went through 4-5 lawnmowers. Returned a few but still had 3 not working under a deck finally threw out. That one brand they promo has starter issues. Finally bought a Honda engine mower from a competitor and now have a few that all always start.Not much else though. Appliance prices are competitive, Decking, wood all well stocked.

I was informed it is against company policy for the associates to (use a pair of scissors and) cut it out of the package. I'd ""have to drive home to do this"". Seriously?? The problem was, home was not in the direction that I was going, that I needed the lock for! So, I had to drive several miles home (the wrong way), just to drive back past that same Lowe's store to a storage unit where I needed to use the lock.Lowe's CORPORATE! LISTEN UP! I can buy a lock ANYWHERE! When your Customer Service is gone, you will eventually go the way of Montgomery Wards and others! (Sorry for the caps, not yelling, but for emphasis).

We didnt like the fridge, Lowes has a 90 day exchange policy. We picked out a new one, in stock, so we didnt have to wait another 3 months. delivery people show up, remove the old one and then can't fit the new in the opening to kitchen (it would have fit in the actual spot) I'm at work, wife at home. I talked to the delivery guy (Retail Direct is contracted by Lowes to deliver, they are TERRIBLE) i said ""take the doors off"" he told me, and I quote ""I can't do that"". so he takes out new fridge, leaves a 30 foot scratch down my driveway and put the (old) new one back in. Now the water supply/ice doesn't work. When I complain, they blame my valve (its a saddle valve) Lowes and Retail Direct both say their techs are not allowed to touch those type. But they did, 3 times. once on inital install, then to replace new fridge, then reinstall (old) new fridge. The gouge/scratch in driveway was 3/9/2021. This is 4/9/2021 and I have conversations and heated discussions for hours with various Lowes personnel, including the appliance manager, Jaime, who was rude and useless.

My personal experience is a month and still going (still missing 53 pieces of my order and their system says it has been delivered). Helpful tips.1. Check back multiple times online to see what pieces and when. Do not expect what is supposed to be delivered will be. Expect items that did not arrive to show in their system as delivered. 2. Do not expect the 1-800 Rep to be able to be of any real assistance. Lowes policy does not allow them to be. Expect to have to call several times about your order so your issue can be ""escalated.""3. Try not to take it out on their workers. They do their best with what they got.

Cooperate and store acted unconcerned. Too bad too sad warranty was out. They first tried to tell us we were dragging furniture across floor. No. How ridiculous. Then they said it wasn't material or product issue. If it had been in one spot I'd maybe agree. But since it's all over our house it has to be bad glue. I've contacted cooperate several times. They kept sending us to store. They don't want to keep a good customer. We have flooring down that's been there since house was built in 2006. No problems at all. The glue was bad and they don't want to fork out a couple hundred to fix our floor. We are happy with product. The glue was bad and they need to own up to it.

Lowe's Companies,We ordered some flooring online and had…,We ordered some flooring online and had issues right from the start. After initially placing the order we received a call about a week later about the payment no being processed. This of course was because of the bank restrictions on large purchases. So after sorting out the bank end of things we lifted the restrictions for the day and reprocessed the payment explaining that it had to be done that day or the bank would reinstate the restriction. The representative acknowledged that this was understood and that delivery would not be affected. After traveling to the store (2 hr drive) to pick up our product they told us that it was not there so they would arrange free delivery when it arrived. The day of the delivery the store called and notified us the payment had once again not completed and delivery was not possible without payment. This was of course before the bank was open so having the restriction lifted was not possible and they could not make an ACH transfer so they would have to move the delivery to the next week. We ended up having to once again travel to the store and cancel the order and pay in store in order to just end up loading the product ourselves. Highly inconvenient and outside of the initial free delivery offering we were not compensated for any of our troubles. Very disappointed and will not buy from Lowe’s again.,0,1

We ordered on 3/21/21 and scheduled delivery for 4/2/21, because we were planning on putting the fence up that weekend. 4/2/21 rolls around and we get a call from the delivery coordinator in Coralville, Iowa (Natasha Haman) saying that part of our order is not in stock at the main store so it will have to be transferred which won't be delivered until Monday (4/5/21) because they were rearranging flatbeds that day. (We scheduled this delivery date for a reason, 2 weeks in advance but you have to rearrange flatbeds that day? You didn't know that head of tike and couldn't plan for this?) But the rest of our materials would be delivered today as expected. Ok, great and all but we can't complete the fence without the stringer panels. So that only allowed us to put the posts in the ground and nothing else this weekend. Monday comes and we missed a call from Natasha early afternoon confirming the delivery for Tuesday. Umm no. We called her back saying she confirmed Monday in her email and forwarded her the email highlighting the day she promised. She started to make an excuse and my boyfriend stopped her saying that she needs to make the delivery happen as she originally promised and we will speak to her supervisor if she can't do her damn job. She said she would take care of it. Well no delivery Monday and Tuesday rolls around and she calls us again with more bad news/excuses that there is a 4 hour delay from the trucks not being on time this morning. Ok that isn't our problem, our delivery better be here today. She stated that she has other customers she has to fulfill orders to. Oh are we not paying customers that have already been pushed back 3 times now? He demanded her supervisor and he said there isn't anything he can do since the trucks have all been loaded up and have left the warehouse to their destinations. He promised it will be delivered tonight (4/7/21). Both Natasha and the supervisor seemed like they couldn't care less that the customer service they provided has been horrific. She obviously cannot do her job as a delivery coordinator. We will be spending another night waiting around for the delivery truck and if this delivery gets delayed again, we are done. I will be canceling this order and will be purchasing the rest of the materials from our local Menards. This has been the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We moved into our first house last February and have ordered from Lowes on 2 other occasions and have had problems with both of those deliveries as well. One time an order just disappeared from their screens and I had to go into the store multiple times to show my emailed invoice and spoke to multiple different people before it finally got resolved. And the other time, we were not notified when our order came into the store for pickup. We had to call down there for the person to not know how to help us so we drove to the store to find thatcthe item was there for almost a week! Lowes all around has provided me horrible customer service and I will no longer be giving them my money. Home Depot and Menards have treated me better than this. Coralville, Iowa: you should get a new delivery coordinator, the lady you currently have doesn't do her job well and is poorly representing your store.UPDATE:It is now 8pm CST on 4/7/21 and we still didn't receive our delivery, so the supervisor didn't make sure this delivery happened like he said either. We keep getting pushed back and are expected to just wait around every night for a delivery that never shows up. They apparently will deliver our stuff whenever they want to,, but they have already taken my money..guess that is all they care about, not providing good customer service. I will be calling the Coralville location tomorrow and canceling my order and I will never be purchasing from Lowes again, this has been the worst customer service I have ever received.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,My husband and I spent almost 3 hours…,"My husband and I spent almost 3 hours at Lowe's in Knoxville this evening. They advertised a promotion for 12 months interest free if you spent over $299. We were way over this amount. The register only allowed for 6 months. Not one person, including the manager, knew how to overdrive the system to give us the 12 month promotion that was being advertised on their site. Out of pure frustration and my husband receiving an on call from work, we very reluctantly took the 6 month promotion and left. Then we went to load up 6 bags of 50 pound concrete. Two employees watched us and never helped. Then we went to load up 24 of the 2x4x8 wood and again another two employees never offered to help and just watched us, yet helped the next customer load up his order into his truck. We are extremely disappointed in the service at Lowe's tonight. It has left an extremely bad taste in our mouths all round and they have probably lost us as a customer. Home Depot is just around the corner, literally, and I'm sure will be more than willing to assist in our future purchases.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,April 5th,"April 5th, 2021Dear Mr. Ellison, If you could see by the email below you can see I already had a very bad experience with lowes in February. But you and Lowe's corrected that and the dent in my zero turn on delivery. So I said I would try you again after spending 20,000 easily every year with my landscaping company. Well I have been buying at Lowe's then last week I thought I'd try again and get something delivered. Order # 720730135 Invoice # 91954 was ordered and was guaranteed delivery today between 12-4 so here we go again it's 5:15pm no delivery and no one will answer there phones at Lowe's. I ordered from Danville va but it looks like it's coming from Rocky mount va. So I called 8 times and nothing!! So on this pretty day I lost 5 hours of 2 businesses I was to do today because no show, no contact, NOTHING! What must 1 company do stay in business with you?? I'm so sick of this and I'm sure I'm not the only one!!! I would appreciate you doing something about this. Because of lowes I lost 625.00 today plus my time!! PsI got a voicemail at 7:30 last night from your home office about bringing it out tomorrow morning. That won't work! I took off 5 hours today just for this delivery, now I can't be there until after 4pm tomorrow because I have over 90 customers that are in line everyday for me and my crew. That's why I specifically took off 12 -4 today for delivery. I really don't know how your going to make up for this at this point. Feb 9th, 2021 emailTo whom it may concern:Very poor service. I just paid over 3200.00 with you and the manager from reidsville nc was very nice and call me to re-schedule for tomorrow which I said was fine because they had to assemble my zero turn mower I bought online. I want the CEOs number!! Order # 717333326 Invoice # 70266, The problem is I was supposed to receive an email or call to give me a time for delivery tomorrow by 5pm, Never got it. I run a lawn care service so timing is of the essence for me. So at 7:30 pm tonight I called your customer service dept. So whoever the hateful girl that answered needs a new job. I work daily for 28 years with customers and I would never treat anyone that way. She stated ""it will be there tomorrow when it gets there"" I will NEVER, EVER shop at lowes again!! I spend over 20,0000 a year here, i shop at lowes for over 12 yesrs and I just got off the phone with home depot to set up my contractor service there from now on. This is so unprofessional and acceptable how i was treated!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Non-existing Customer Service,I had bought very expensive white pebbles from on-line and many of them are brokend and some to dust. Also the order didn't come in on time and I didn't order enought so had to buy more. The second order of the same pebbles came in completly different shape and color.I have been trying to call customer service. The first time after an hour I got the rep and she told me to hold off for a manager. Waited for 45 mintues and then she hang up on me. Tried calling back and they said they were closed. I have been trying to call to no avail. emailed them and no answer. They use COVID as an excuse for this. We all know profits are through the roof right now for construction related companies. STAY AWAY From them.,0,1

Lowe's Companies,"ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY EVER, DO NOT BUY FROM HERE - AVOID AT ALL COSTS","The absolute worst experience I've ever had with any appliance company. After ordering a new fridge through their website, they've managed to deliver us two damaged fridges in a row, both looking like they fell off the back of the truck a few times en route to us. They use a third party delivery service that they have almost no communication with whatsoever, so it's a huge clusterf***. When they arrive, never during their pre-scheduled time slot, they tell us that they can't leave the fridge with us because it's a liability. They don't even check the fridge for damage before having us set aside time to be available, empty out our old fridge, and await the new one. They tell us on site at the back of the truck that they can't leave the fridge with us and we're back to square one. After paying full price for a fridge, full price for haul away of our old one, and working with as large of a company as Lowe's, I'll never again go through this experience and recommend everyone and everyone to stay far, far away. It's a huge waste of time, energy, and money with only a measly 10% discount to be offered as penance. It's insulting, this has taken up more time than I can even muster recounting, and to top it off - I'm about to give birth. Pretty sure I'll be in the hospital calling Lowe's in between contractions at this rate. No consideration whatsoever to COVID, pregnancy, people's time and money, or customer service. Their managers sometimes come in around noon, and will call back whenever they feel like it - and lower level employees can do nothing to escalate.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Defective toilet seat,"Defective toilet seatOn 3-30-21 around 5 P.M., I told customer service that parts were broken on a toilet seat which came with a Kohler toilet I had purchased there. This was at the Lowe's store in Oldsmar, Florida. The girls who were at customer service had Karen who works in that department come to the front. Within minutes Karen replaced the toilet seat. I also want to mention how knowledgable she is. I bought several items in the department a couple of weeks earlier and was so helpful!",0,5
Lowe's Companies,I’m so tired of poor customer service…,"I’m so tired of poor customer service from big box stores. Lowe’s was once a favorite place to shop. The inventory and overall experience was usually good. Now, not so much. I can accept reduced inventory, but not the obvious corporate greed that keeps them from properly staffing their stores. The staff now lacks sufficient experience to offer any real assistance. They don’t have knowledge of the products or even possess basic customer service skills. Clearly poor training and limited skill sets are the new normal. The store managers don’t seem to recognize the imbalance of employees in various departments. During my last visit, Flooring had one kid to service at least a dozen shoppers, while doors and windows had three employees simply sitting around without a customer in sight. Asking to speak with a manager is just adding insult to injury. You’ll only be further disappointed and frustrated. Some of the managers seem frustrated themselves. Corporate has driven this mammoth company off the rails as it’s not this way at Home Depot or even Menard’s. Seems Lowe’s is a hurry to follow Sears on its way out of business. You may think I’m being harsh, but this is only one in a sea of negative reviews they’re racking up lately.",0,1

Some months ago we purchased a refrigerator and, when delivered, they refused to unwrap it or install it because of Covid. Luckily, I am a 90-year old engineer and was able to install it with the help of my 85-year old wife. Just today, I activated my Lowe's credit card for the first time and tried to place an order for a freezer & dolly. My discount just showed the regular 5% and not the 20% for first use of the Lowe's credit card. I waited for over an hour to get an agent on the phone and was transferred to someone else and had to wait another 15 minutes when someone asked me for feedback rather than helping me with my order.

This is just a beginning a nightmare, later I talked to the store manger finally after waiting long time, she said they do not have the device in store, the local center did not pass the device to them. And promise will call me back to get this resolved, but I did not get one. Later I checked the on line account, it was canceled. Next day is Easter, they were off, and coming morning I called the customer service again, I was told it is out of stock, but I try to order it again on line, it is still available, then I said I need to talk to his manager. He is very reluctant, after wait for long time again, a manager came and I ordered it again, but will be delivered another 8 days later. For a person waiting for dryer for all the wet clothes, I can not accept this kind of service and deliver time, especially it was due to their fault. If I knew it was like this, I should order ti from HomeDepot. I am not sure whether I can get it this time either, this is totally different with my previous experience with them, my old dryer was bought form them too.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"CAMIYAH, Athens TN LOWE'S #1196","On, Saturday, 04/03/2021, I ordered 2, 4'x8' sheets of plywood online from the Lowes in Athens,TN store#1196. So once I was notified that my order was ready, naturally I drove my truck to the large bay door section of the parking lot, where the LUMBER dept. is, went inside and the cashier in the LUMBER dept. where PLYWOOD is, said you have to go to the other end of the store, show them your receipt and let them know that you are here to pick up your merchandise. I said it's PLYWOOD, this is the LUMBER section of the store. She was pleasant enough and said I'm sorry sir but you have to go there. OK, so I go to the other end of the store, truck still at the LUMBER end of the lot, where the PLYWOOD is to show an employee my receipt. She looks it up on the computer and says we have your merchandise here. There were two 4'x 8' sheets of plywood leaning against the wall. I said, I guess I'm supposed to carry them from here to the other end of the store where my Truck is near the LUMBER section of the store where the PLYWOOD section is. She said No, you can get a blue cart and take it from here. I said, So I went to the LUMBER section where the PLYWOOD is stocked and the large blue carts for carrying the PLYWOOD are and they tell me to come here. Now you want me to go all the way back to the LUMBER dept. where the PLYWOOD was originally and get a blue cart and bring it back here so that you can put the PLYWOOD on that cart and then I push it all the way to the other end of the store where the PLYWOOD was originally and go out that large bay door to load it into my truck. I said Why don't you have the blue carts here if you expect customers to drag there LUMBER to the other end of the store. By this time she looked at me like I had two heads and didn't know what to say. All the while I'm watching this one employee, CAMIYAH was her name, move items from a blue LUMBER cart, and place my lumber onto that cart. She walked up toward me, pushing the cart, with a smile on her face, and asked if I would like my receipt printed or sent to my email. I said I'll take it here if you have it. I signed the receipt and CAMIYAH smiled and thanked me for shopping at Lowes, handed me my copy. Yes I pushed that PLYWOOD to the other end of the store, to the LUMBER dept. and went out the large bay doors to my truck. My message to LOWE'S is, whoever the high payed corporate stooge is that designed your system for picking up LUMBER that you order online, should be demoted to stock boy/girl and replaced by CAMIYAH. She was the only person, with a smilem on her face, that reacted quickly and did her best to quell the situation that was created by the stooge at the Corporate Office. LOWE's would do well to have CAMIYAH, and others like her in positions that have a larger impact on the public then just solving my situation. The 5star rating is for CAMIYAH not LOWE's",0,5

Unable to figure out the in-store credit, another clerk or manager abruptly told me they would never give me credit or refund on a receptacle because contractors were always buying them and then returning the old receptacle in the box and try to get a refund. I informed them the item was defective, and I'm not a contractor. Either way, no refund and no in-store credit. What a nice setup for Lowes. Sell defective products and let the customer suck it up.

Lowe's Companies,"Midwest City, OK store lost my business","Midwest City, OK Lowe's lost a $2,800 sale today because of poor customer service in the Lawn and Garden Dept. I already had a riding lawnmower picked out but also had a few questions I needed answered. After 30 minutes of standing among the mowers outside and looking in every direction, no employee had come anywhere near me or asked if I needed help. I went inside to the customer service desk but there was one person working and about 10 people in line. So I stood in line for 15 min. at L&G and asked the cashier if someone could help me with lawn mowers. He first said, ""Someone should be out there."" When I told him I hadn't seen anyone for the last half hour, he said he would page someone over the store intercom. Another cashier was showing him how to do that when a man with a clipboard (a manager?) overheard their conversation. ""Who needs help?"" he asked. ""A customer needs help with a lawn tractor,"" they said. The ""manager"" actually stood there and argued back and forth (four times!) with the cashiers about whether it should be called a ""lawn tractor"" or a ""lawn mower."" He was very condescending to his own coworkers, never offered to help, and I WAS OBVIOUSLY STANDING RIGHT THERE! They eventually made the announcement, and I walked back out to the mower area and waited. Nothing. I started to walk back toward L&G when I saw a worker running toward me from the front door of the store. I turned and came back, but she ran straight past me to help another employee who was moving flowers around. When I re-entered this time, the only person I could find was a young man stocking plants and trees. I asked again if someone might be available to help, and he said (I'm quoting), ""To be honest, you may have to wait 20-25 minutes, sir. It's like this every day. People just disappear, and I don't know why."" Well, that decided it for me. I went to Home Depot and bought my lawnmower there.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Disgusted is an understatement,"Disgusted is an understatement! Lowes is NOT doing PELLA windows any favors by selling and installing their product. I have been working for over TWO YEARS to resolve a window installation and damage issue caused by Lowes, sold by Store #1047 in Oaks PA. I just want my window re-installed properly, the damage to the surrounding area repaired and my money refunded for both the materials we paid for that were not used and the time I have spent holding a supposedly reputable company accountable for their work.The windows were installed on 4 February 2019. We informed Lowes of two issues with the windows in April 2019. From April 2019 to June 2020 we were given the run around, bounced from person to person, ignored, etc. It wasn’t until I got the direct numbers for the Sales Rep who sold us our windows and the Contractor who installed them and called them on a weekly basis that I finally got some traction. The same contractor finally came out in June 2020 and replaced one window sash and removed and reinstalled our kitchen window. At that time it was discovered that although we had paid to have Pella Tape and Pella Sealant used on all of our windows, it was NOT used on ANY window. In August 2020 our kitchen window that had just been installed began leaking profusely. This time I called Lowes Corporate Customer Service because I did not want the same contractor coming out or to spend another year getting it fixed. The woman I spoke to said that she recalled our case, that she was very sorry and that she would work to get the window repaired and then address financial compensation for the Pella Tape and Sealant that was not used. This time the same contractor came out and performed some sort of repair within 2 weeks. I contacted the Lowes customer service rep to let her know the work was done, thank her for getting it taken care of so quickly and discuss the financial compensation. Surprise, surprise she no longer returned any of my emails or phone calls. Even less of a surprise was when the window began leaking AGAIN in September 2020. This time even worse and the dry wall around the window began cracking, peeling, etc. I sent pictures and videos of the damage and the leaks; I left many voicemails and sent many emails. I was given the run around again until 12 November 2020 I was told a Lowes Claims Rep would be coming out to inspect the damage and then schedule a date for repair of the damage as well as fix the installation. After that none of my phone calls or emails were returned. In January 2021, I sent an email saying that if I did not hear back I would be submitting a claim in small claims court. I then called the general line 2x that week and both times was told that their Supervisor would be calling me by Friday. I never received a phone call but Friday afternoon my husband received an email from a new representative and we had to start the info process all over again. They finally sent a Pella Rep out to inspect the installation but he said he could not speak to how it was installed because he was not there, but that there is definitely a gap where water is getting in. It is April 2021 and we are STILL WAITING on them to repair the damage and they have yet to address compensation or fixing the materials that were not used.

Lowe's Companies,Customer service bad experience,"I had a very bad experience returning a stove to the store,when I went to return the stove the first time it had already reduced in price but I had my original purchase receipt with the price I paid, but the customer service told me that when she scanned the computer it only sent her the current price, like this she returned two different amounts on my credit card, add up to the amount I paid, well I bought the stove with my credit card again and the oven did not work well again, when I went to return it with all my original receipts , the manager did not understand the receipts and he yelled at me when I tried to explain that he didn't returning the correct amount, of course all the transactions are on my credit card reflected, He only return part to the card with a difference of $ 101.00 than when I bought the next stove after a back and forth yelling match because I get too angry and did not receive my full money back, so when I pay for the other stove at the same price ,he just reduced $ 100.00 as a discount to the stove, so which was not any discount if was the money that I had already paid previously and he said that since he had already given me that discount he would not give me the 5% discount or the 12 months without interest. So now I have to pay more on my credit card from before and the stoves cost the same. A credit is supposed to cover the other purchase but it was not like that, they did everything wrong from the beginning and I never got the discount.",0,1

They will do everything in their power to avoid paying out a claim on it...especially on a $1,500 hot water heater. The way they operate is SOOOOO sleezy. They bounce you around from company to company, claiming these companies have the responsibility to service your unit under the warranty, when in fact they do not. First they sent me to Bradford White, then to American Hot Water Heater, then to National Electronics Warranty, then to Asurion, who just told me to call Lowes and file a claim with them, but there is no way to file a claim with Lowes directly because they either sold off the warranty or won't stand behind it any longer. It is really inexcusable. Event the people they keep sending me to that are listed above are embarrassed by how bad it is because they tell me they get 4 or more calls a day from pissed off customer that they can't help.

Lowe's Companies,Worst store I have visited,"Worst store I have visited. Bought a bag of fertilizer last week, and when opened it and put in the spreader, it was wet and sticky and totally unusable. I brought to the store for exchange right away, the person who appeared to be a supervisor at the return desk basically called me a liar and said something like ‘how do I know it was bought yesterday and from here ...’, even I just told them that I charged it on my credit card and they can easily verify. Sounds annoyed and resentful from the start. How the hell do Lowe’s put people like that in the customer service??!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowe’s = CRAP. The list of this company is,"The list of how crappy this company is, is literally to long to go into here.Just the last transaction I will ever have with this steaming pile of a so called company. We purchased a special order Samsung refrigerator. It came in about a month later and we paid extra to have it delivered. It was finally delivered and naturally it was damaged. We we told someone would be in touch about replacing it. Sometime later (days), I was given a date and time of 12:30 to replace the dented door. Then I was texted a different day and given a time of between 11:00-3:00. On the day they were to come out, I heard nothing from them. No call, text, email. Just nothing. And now a week later and I’m still trying to get hold of someone who knows anything about it... run away from this lame azz company!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Where do I start,"Where do I start? They say they care about veterans, have special vet's parking, and 10% off military discount. We purchased a washer and dryer and pedestals for them to go on as they were too short without the pedestal. We take paper work up and the cashier tells my husband - a 14+ year vet - that he cannot use his military discount because they are on sale and it's ""double dipping."" Hello? Really? Then, we are told there is not a military discount on appliances at all. So we can spend over 2000.00 on appliances, and suddenly they don't care about vets so much anymore. Fast forward to day of install. The delivery man from Lowe's shows up with a dryer - no washer. No call saying they are only bringing one. Supposedly the washer didn't come in but don't bother to notify the customer of that facct. We refused the dryer and said - no we want both at the same time especially because they gave us no clue when the washer would be there or even if it was ordered. The Lowe's delivery person couldn't even tell us when or IF the washer was coming in. So I call Lowe's Frenchtown Twp Store in Michigan to find out where the washer is I paid for. I spoke to a manager first who was super rude because he was on another line and ""busy"". Then, I told him forget it my husband would come down to the store instead. The manager rudely told me it won't make a difference if he comes down or not and to just call back. Basically, the manager just didn't want to deal with my husband face-to-face. My husband was pissed then and down to the store he went. Long story short - they gave us a 100.00 credit and rescheduled the install OF BOTH washer and dryer the following week. We thought okay, now we are all set. But no.....Fast forward AGAIN, day of install they do indeed have both the washer and dryer. But No PEDESTALS. We called Lowe's again and they state we didn't buy them. We had a lengthy convo with the salesperson when we purchased the washer and dryer about whether or not to pay for the pedestal drawers and we ultimately decided to get them. We watched the salesperson scan everything. My husband saw them on the screen. The salesman got interrupted with something during our sale and a lady named Dawn finished the sale. We took paperwork up front and checked out. It turns out Dawn removed the pedestals because they were rung up twice. Instead of removing one set she removed two! Why? Of course, we could not figure what was going on because we saw the first salesperson scan them. NEVER will I let two salepeople ring me up again. I can't remember why the first guy had to leave the transaction, but I would insist he finish the sale before leaving. Just leaves too much room for a mistake to happen.We tried to call corporate Lowe's to complain about all these mishaps because the store managers are rarely helpful and often rude. We called on Tuesday, 3/30/2021 EST at 3:00 pm. A recording says they are CLOSED. They are open EST 9-5 PM Mon-Friday. Color me stupid here, but I AM calling during THOSE BUSINESS HOURS AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN! Finally, my husband did get ahold of corporate. They sent an email to the store suggesting restitution be made with us. We had to dicker with the store manager and finally settled on they would give us the pedestals that were 500.00 for 100.00. In my opinion. they should have just given us the pedestals for free given the total disaster this was. My husband actually ended up taking multiple days off work for install. Oh and there is more. Lowe's farms out the install to other companies. When they finally installed - they didn't hook up the washer correctly. they neglected to hook up the hose. I did a load of laundry the first time and my laundry room FLOODED. When Lowe's called the installers to come back out after I complained - the company said that crew was done for the day. That evening my husband fixed the issue when he got off work. Never heard a word from the install company. Lesson? NEVER EVER buy appliances from Lowe's. What a joke. Horrible experience",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Terrible customer service and they don't stand behind products,"Most of the time in the store you can't find anyone to help you.

Lowe's Companies,Customer service and delivery of prepaid items,"The San Antonio TX Lowe`s at Callaghan and IH-10 has the most incompetent delivery service I have EVER been associated with. My most recent purchase od washer AND dryer pair was purchased on a Thursday evening and scheduled for delivery the following Monday as agreed and ensured prior to the purchase and store delivery calendar referenced for assurance. Delivery and install personnel were to call that day prior to, and for notice of exact time. My wife and I had plenty other chores going on in preparation for upcoming HOLYDAY / Holiday but we made the extra effort to have one of us at home ALL DAY that day. We both made multiple attempts to contact the delivery referenced phone #, customer service #, ""an associate"" as the robo-service directed. EVERY time ( and that was more than a dozen times between 1pm and 6 pm when we became seriously concerned) we were connected to a phone ringing that eventually turned into a busy signal... AND I do mean EVERY TIME at EVERY OPTION... My wife finally decided to drive to that store location on Callaghan Rd @ IH-10 ( approx- 10 - 12 blocks from my home where delivery was scheduled for) where she purchased the appliances to see if she could get any answers. Eventually she was able to talk to a ""manager"" at the customer service desk (one who evidently does NOT answer that phone as I was calling that # even as my wife was there). Tania told her she could not help her with that and that she would have to ""CALL BACK TOMORROW and speak to Lili the delivery coordinator between 8-12 pm"" with a hand written note to that effect............ My wife almost lost it and responded ""and like someone will answer a phone in this place?"" Needless to say I will be back there in the morning to either get the appliances then and there OR get a complete refund. Shameful and ridiculous how customers are treated with no sign of remorse or concern for any such Ridiculously POOR SERVICE.....if you can even refer to such as that as service!!!!

Great forward thinking, I naively thought. The store it was transferred to was also out of stock. So, I searched online and found a third store that had 6 in-stock and on hand. The fulfilment was never sent to the store that had them on hand. I had to drive to both locations to coordinate the fulfillment of my own order. Never have I been so inconvenienced as to have to do the companies work for them for my own purchase. McDonalds might as well require customers to go to the back and make their own burger.

Lowe's Companies,"Don't order a refriguartor from Lowe's of Bethlehem, Pa","On Sunday, March 7, 2021 my refrigerator failed. As I needed one right away I found one that would work, was in stock and available according to the website at my local Lowe’s store in Bethlehem, PA. In fact the website said there were 2 in stock at the Bethlehem store. I went to the store at 8:00 AM Monday morning to place an order. The salesman checked and said there were actually 3 in stock but before he wrote the order he wanted to go back and physically check. After about a half an hour he came back and said he couldn't find one. He then found someone who was more familiar with the warehouse to check and he also couldn't find one.The salesman said he could order one from the central warehouse and try to get in by Friday. He said Lowe’s delivery time from the central warehouse was between 3 and 5 business and they had 67 in stock. He said he would send the central warehouse an email requesting that they send the refrigerator as soon as possible. I later found out he did. However, when he went to place the order the system wouldn't allow him to place the order since there were 3 in stock. So he had find the manger and have him zero out the stock so he could place the order. This was finally done sometime after 9:00 AM.So, of course, Friday goes by, Monday goes by, Tuesday goes by, Friday goes by, another Monday, Tuesday and Friday goes by and no refrigerator comes in as promised. I called to check on the delivery many times with the usual waiting time to get an answer between 30 to 45 minutes. Finally on Monday, March 22, 2021 after waiting on the line for 45 minutes I am told the refrigerator was at the store and they would deliver it the next morning. Not bad only 15 days later.So, on Tuesday the delivery truck arrives and I will have a refrigerator again. Not so, as the delivery truck rips down my electric and cable lines and blows the neighborhood electric out. While waiting there is nothing else to do but unload the refrigerator and get the old one out. While they were getting the new refrigerator out of the truck, PP&L comes to fix the downed lines and I go out to talk to him. While I was with him they go in and take the old refrigerator out. When I get back and they are ready to take the new refrigerator into the house. I stop them and inspect it and there is no damage. Then I followed them into the house and stop them when they catch the ac cord on a gate. If I had not been there they would have ripped the cord out of the refrigerator. So the refrigerator is in the kitchen and they are going to help unpack it and switch the door openings.NOT IN MY LIFETIME. They left. They did call the delivery manager and I talked to her. She said, “Sorry about the power lines but they must have been too low”. Not Lowe’s problem. Amazing, I have lived here 45 years and nobody else knocked the power lines down. Also Lowe's delivered a range here this summer without a problem.So, I unpacked the refrigerator and changed the doors around. Incidentally, the instructions which came with the refrigerator were for another refrigerator. I got power and cable back. I also fixed the screen door frame which was damaged when they took the old refrigerator out. They also found it was easier to drive on my grass rather than my driveway and I fixed that too. In addition they left securing bolts in my driveway. Just wonderful customer service. I have been a customer of this store since it opened.",0,1

However, when someone did answer and I inquired about my order, the gentleman simply said we have not been able to place the order yet. So I tried to pry a little more to get him to elaborate, and he said again that his screen simply said order not placed. There was a bit of a silence as I waited for him to perhaps explain a little more. I then asked if he could maybe tell me when I can expect the trailer? He then asked if I could hold again as he asked his manager if he could look into. I said great! thank you! I was on hold for another 20 min when he hung up on me suddenly. I looked at the time and they were closed, I called again and they said they were closed. Sooo, this representative kept me on hold for an additional 20 min only to hang up on me and peace out because his shift was over?

Lowes had stalled, put me off and lied to me for almost a month and now, how long would it be to get it installed? He didn’t know. I realized right then and there they had no intention of doing the right thing and making good on their promise to replace the dishwasher. Unbelievably, someone called the next day to ask about the dishwasher delivery! He was obviously unaware someone had called the day before and I had told him to forget it, we were done being lied to and wanted nothing more to do with Lowes. I told him getting it installed the same day as delivery was important if he could do something about that, but he couldn’t.

Lowe's Companies,Waste of Time,"My wife purchased a bosh dishwasher that was over 1400 dollars. She asked the sales lady if it was in stock and she physical had it in the store. She said yes. The installer did not show up on the delivery date so we called him and he said he had problems that day. He did not even pickup the phone to say he was not coming. Then he said he was going to deliver it on another date which is today. He went to Lowes and they had sold my dishwasher our from under us. I will never ever step into that store again. Its the worst place on earth. If I could give them 5 minus stars I would. Now I haft to fight for my money back. Kiss my Butt Lowes. So Pissed, I lost pay from work for nothing.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Purchased a  Frigidaire side-by-side…,"Purchased a Frigidaire side-by-side refrigerator with water and ice and an extended warranty for 3 years. 14 days ago the refrigerator and freezer completely stopped working. I ended up Calling the service centre for the extended warranty which took 2 hours to get through to anybody. Even that I got no resolve. They were in no rush to help me I had to wait 10 days to get a service Tech out with a part. The park did not repair the problem so the technician said the refrigerator was not repairable. The service department needed to hire a tack to check the Tech the nature what he was telling us was true. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever had to deal with the store manager does not have any power to make any decisions at store level. Now were going on 15 days still no refrigerator and they just don't get it and they still have any waiting without any answers of what they are going to do. I called the store I get hung up on twice I call the service centre at least 2 hours of wait time. They tell you the warranty is good but I tell you and I caution everybody do not by any appliances from Lowe's or do not by their extended warranty because they do not care. Able to nothing to help the customer and I mean nothing to help the customer. My circumstances were I have a large household 5 people to kids living in my house to go without a refrigerator for 10 days plus 14 days of them now is absolutely calculus and it cost me way too much money to feed these kids to keep by an ice but they still don't get it. And when the text says the refrigerator's not repairable it should be it's not repairable you have to hire a tack to check the Tech that sounds like a crock!!!! I strongly recommend Costco or home depot their customer service is outstanding they do care enable go out of their way to satisfy their customer or Lowe's will not absolutely will not!!! Everybody I spoke too including Jesse the store manager, the service department, All told me something different like I could get a loner I could get a gift card none of this is true they do nothing to help the customer please Please listen to this post because they will put you in a bad spot go to Costco strongly recommended even after 2 years they will replace the item with a new one.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Worst washer and dryer delivery!!!,"Bought washer and dryer online. Confirmed in stock and delivery in 2 weeks. Received email confirmation of 4 hour window for 3/19 delivery. Window passes no call, no delivery. 8:00 pm that same day someone calls from delivery company says I'm sorry a thousand times with every lame excuse in the book. Says its gonna be put on the truck for the morning 1st thing. It is now the next day 3/20 its 12:30 and I get a call from Lowes again I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. Its the last delivery of the day and it will be there by 7:00 pm. They show up at 830 pm. You could see they were completely exhausted from a long day. They wanted to make this delivery as quick as possible and get home. They broke the vent house on installation, completely ruined our floors with their dirty shoes and the one main driver called my husband ""boss"" couple hundred times. On his way out he said ""thats the best we can do boss"". Well this is the best review we can write!!! Horrible experience from the moment I booked this washer/dryer from Lowes. Never again!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Round Rock Lowes has a customer service issue…,"This would be specific about the round rock lowes store. I was trying to buy a prehung door and about $200 of lumber and get it delivered to my home. I had to make three trips to the store before I was able to talk to someone who could make that happen. The first two trips the employees could not even tell me how to make that happen. I finally got that setup and they delivered only part of my lumber order and did not deliver the door. I asked the delivery folks and they said they didn't know about that but figured it would come on a different delivery. I then got a call from Ashley for an ""update"" where she told me that they were going to deliver only part of the order. I told her I have already recieved it. She then said they she could not find my door and was not sure when it could be delivered. I told her that I was there Tuesday and it was Thursday and that I put my hand on one and the employee said they had 5 on hand. She said she could only say that she did not know where my door was or when it could be gotten to me. I asked if she could tell whether the store had any.. and she said.. well.. yes.. we have three.. so I asked why then are you not able to say when I would be getting my door. she just reiterated that she could not find my door. I drove over to the store and put my hand on the door, then I tried to speak to the store manager to discuss why I could find the door but the employees could not ? I stopped by the customer service desk and asked to speak to the store manager. The employee asked me if I had spoken to him before? I said what does that have to do with anything? she then said there was a hierarchy that I would have to go through.. I said I don't care about that.. I want to speak to the store manager.. she said.. ""can I look at the schedule?"" I said I am not stopping you..then she said.. ""do you have children ?"" I asked what does that have to do with anything ? I recorded her saying all of this and she admitted to it. I asked her if I was disrespectful to her in anyway.. spoke to her in any form or fashion that was inappropriate and she said no. so I asked again.. ""what does it matter if I have children or not"" no response. at this point her manager came up and I spoke to her. Monica is incredible and listened and agreed that everything she heard was fine but did not have any idea why the employee spoke to me like that. BOTTOM line is the Round Rock store has a customer service issue with their employees. Monica told me she was going to follow up on this issue with her employee to ensure something like this would not happen again. I did get to speak to the manager Nathan but he never responded with any statements unless I asked him a direct question.. like ""is it ok for an employee to ask whether I have any children or not"" he said no but he never said that he was going to follow up with his staff to ensure customer support would be of a higher quality.. which left me feeling like there was no concern from him. Other than Monica, it left me feeling like Lowes doesn't care about its customer base and how they are treated by their employees at the Round Rock store. I will be looking at going to Home Depot or other Lowes stores to get treated more respectfully.",0,1

I just lost interest.I am not sure if Lowe’s is concerned about customer satisfaction.I had to express multiple times my disapproval and dissatisfaction when things were falling through the crack.My time was spent problem solving and trouble shooting between installer and parts and store.I will not recommend or refer Lowe’s for anything.",0,1

I got a quote on some work in the house-- called and emailed the ""project specialist"" back several times, never with any response over the course of the next month. The last time I called, the phone just rang until I was disconnected.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Bad Customer Service Culture,"Unfortunately, Lowe's does not care about their customers at all. They have rigid policies in place which apparently do not allow their poor front line leaders to make smart decisions to help retain and their keep customers satisfied. I can say this because I recently had an experience where I attempted to return 4 tension wire rolls I bought online with receipt back to the store, and not even get my money back but a store credit, but the store said ""NO"" because it had been 102 days, and their policy is 90 days. I wrote to their CEO Marvin Ellison to explain the situation, and ask them to reconsider their decision based on the facts the product was unused and the product type being returned (tension wire), and the fact I was not even asking for money back and just get a store credit. I did get a call back from the corporate office from the office of the CEO, but the answer was the same ""no"". This to me clearly show the issue of not caring/ no empathy is not a reflection of the employees themselves, but the position of their executive leadership who apparently DOES NOT STRIVE TO RESOLVE CUSTOMER ISSUES AND RETAIN THEM as future customer. So the snake (employment team) follows its head (executive leadership). Because of this experience I personally will never give a cent of my hard-earned money to Lowe's ever again, or at least until there is a change in corporate culture. I, much rather give my money to anyone else, even if I have to drive or pay more for a similar product. And I hope others make the same decision and give their money to other companies that care about their customers.",0,1

I won’t be doing business with them. I’ve tried to reach the store you can’t talk to anyone there you can’t reach the manager no one answers in the kitchen department. Don’t do business with them. I finally sent an email to the kitchen planner she calls me.

Lowe's Companies,Pella Window Replacement FAIL by LOWE'S,"Worst experience ever working with Lowe's on window and door replacement for our home. We hired Lowe's in July 2020 to replace our windows and three doors. We spent over $60K on the order! They were so incompetent they had to reorder 3 TIMES! They literally didn't know what they were doing and shouldn't be in the contracting business. They delivered our 46 wood windows and dropped them off in our driveway in the rain! We told them they were getting ruined and they hadn't thought ahead to where the windows would be going in the winter. We had to move everything out of our garage so they had a place to put them and then they didn't return again for 3 months! They moved the windows into our garage in September and didn't install until Thanksgiving!They didn't complete the job until February 2021- 7 MONTHS LATER! The installers did a terrible job installing the doors. They didn't remove the trim or use door shims to make them straight and as a result they didn't close correctly. When we asked someone to look at the installers work, it took another 6 weeks for someone to return and fix it. They require 100% of the money upfront when ordering so there is no incentive to complete the job on time. PLEASE save yourself the frustration and time by going anywhere else other than Lowe's.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,It's very sad that you can't buy carpet…,"It's very sad that you can't buy carpet at Lowes when you want it. We went to Lowes in Palm Springs to look at carpet as we were ready to buy. There is never anyone in flooring when we go there. We had to ring the buzzer a few times. We asked to order a sample of carpet they have on their website but not in the store. The guy took our information and said it would be ordered on Monday, as it was Saturday when we were there. He said we should receive it in about a week via FedEx, nothing came. I called in to the Flooring Department four times, and no one ever answered. Then I called back and spoke with customer service who transferred me back to Flooring where no one answered. I called back AGAIN to the customer service desk and explained what I was trying to accomplish. He looked in the system and told me that he could find no order for a carpet sample for me. Then he said he would give the Flooring Department a note to call me. You can guess it, I never heard from them. Why would I now want to do business with a company so irresponsible? Very sad that when you're ready to spend money, you can't.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Ordered online a cord chain saw,"Ordered online a cord chain saw. Waited over 7 weeks. Called multiple times and status of shipment is PENDING. Finally called today and spoke to Cynthia and she was very professional and put me on hold for a few minutes. Later, she returned and told me that my chain saw has been in the store for over 4 days. I have yet to receive an e-mail that the item has been in the store. Cynthia tells me that the item will be in the front at Pick Up. I got to the store around 3:25. Kelsey started the process and gave my copy of order and spoke to 4 different customer service representatives, from Kelsey to Oman to Philip to Freddie (sp?). Asked to speak to the manager on duty twice and no one came to see me. Heard Philip (the guy with a camouflage vest and has the sticker, veteran on the vest spoke to a manager about my order. It appears that the order had a computer issue. Philip called Freddie (Nigerian looking guy with deep accent) from the back. He tells me that I have to return the next day since his printer is broken and cannot print the bar code for my item. Finally Edgar came into the picture and he was able to fix the problem. I left the store with my order at 4:25, one hour later. I called Ariel Gomez and left a VM. The customer service crew was ""playing"" and customers were waiting to return or pick up their items. They all appear to be ""monkeying around"" but not taking care of business. Freddie was rude. Philip was totally unprofessional and thinks he knows all! Worst experience.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RUDE SALES REPS.,"My husband and I visited the Lowe's in Catonsville#624 to have a door installed. It took so long for the installer to call us back in reference what day the door would be put in place. Finally, the install is complete. A representative from Installs Sales calls my husband and informs him that he was overcharged for the installation or the door and he was due for a refund. The rep went on to explain that she would call Lowe's and inform Installs sales with the updated information and we should give the Millwork Department a call at our convenience. I made several attempts to call Lowe's and I could not anyone to answer the phone. My husband and I became frustrated, so we went to Lowe's, to the customer service for assistance. That went HORRIBLE!!! We went to the Millwork department. The sales representatives working in that department, didn't have any prior knowledge of what we were talking about. One of the reps names was Earlene. We tried to explain to her that the phone kept ringing and no one never picked up the phone. She said that something was wrong with the phone system. She was rude, unprofessional and had a very condescending tone. That was a very bad experience and Lowe's is a major corporation and should have the phone systems working!!!! On a personal note, My husband and I both were employed by Lowe's for 6 years{that is where we met}, at the one in Glen Burnie and we never were such a disservice to our customers. My husband and I need additional doors installed, but we will give our business to another company besides Lowe's. I am extremely disappointed with them!! We are still waiting for our refund.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Need to fix customer service,"I went to Lowes yesterday (reluctantly) to the Marks Street store in Henderson Nevada. First salvo was a rude and argumentative kid that decided my door was special order only (simple slab garage access door). After a few go arounds, an older (and wiser) clerk interceded, took me to exactly what I had asked for. Loaded my door and went to cabinets. Although there were a lot of clerks walking around I had to load my cabinets myself from an overhead rack. Next we ran into the same attitude at paint. We stood around until she finally came over and informed us we don't mix stain. Only paint! You're on your own. Hmmm. So we headed to checkout and met with the same attitude. Get your stuff and get out. No offer to help with an 75lb door or cabinets. We do a lot of house flipping and spend a fair amount of money each year on building materials. When we first came to Henderson we avoided Home Depot for the same reason buy I managed to let the manager know why. He told me he was hired to fix the mess and fix it he did. Apparently the POS you have running Lowes on Marks didn't get the memo. Lowes on Boulder is great but too far away and it's no excuse for the Lowes on Marks to behave this way. This is not a one time event but dozens. I repeat dozens! District Manager needs to evaluate the staff from something other than the parking lot!",0,3
Lowe's Companies,Poor quality control from CS,I ordered a Delta faucet online and had to pick it up from Eatontown because my Lowes (Manchester) didn't have any in stock. My options were drive to Eatontown or have it shipped for a measly $65. I picked it up. Opened it when I got home and it was the wrong faucet. It was an obvious return because pieces were loose inside. You'd think customer service would be required to inspect the contents of any boxed return but apparently not in Eatontown. Now I have to go back there next weekend because their staff neglects to do their job. Not how I want to spend my weekend.,0,2

I then received a text that says my order was supposed to be delivered today, Thurs, 3/11. Still no order, just this terrible form which will be probably be ignored in some automated way just like the text, chat, phone call and online order web page.

I called the next day and told the manager that I didn't get my mower, and he seemed very surprised and told me that he was going to call the driver.Later that same day, he called and stated that he would have another mower brought to me the next day. The driver showed up with a dirty ,apparently used riding mower, not what I paid for. I told him that I paid for a brand new riding mowing, and that's exactly what I wanted. I asked him to leave and I went to get my phone. He knocked on my door, and asked me if I would take the mower for 500.00. I told him to leave. I believe that the salesman/manager maybe is involved in a stealing ring. I have never purchased any large items before at Loews so I had no idea that they had such bad reviews until I looked today.

Lowe's Companies,Getting a warranty refund sucks,The last thing I wanted is to be back here complaining again but here I am. I have been waiting since 2/22/2021 for my refund from Lowes on my warranties on appliances that never were delivered and I had to cancel I have been on the phone with them off and on which consumed most of each day I was dealing with them. I got the washer warranty refund check dated 2/25/2021 but because of a mistake when inputting the dryer warranty in it was done twice. The warranty dept refused to see this until 3/7/2021 . I called to verify these 2 refunds and was told they were sent. The 2nd check ( the mistake) had to show a different dryer for it to be excepted. REALLY STUPID.My opinion is the store I bought it from should have refunded everything and cancel the warranties themselves. No customer should have been put through this.,0,1

After 45min waiting on someone to provide customer service the male explained that he couldn't find the order and had to manually input it into the system 🙄. Once he was done tallying up the order it was a $2,500 increase and he would NOT price match their own quote. They didn't have some of the products but yet it was way over the original Lowe's quote.

They only returned my call after shamrock remodeling called and told them about our lack of communication.We finally got it ordered and it came in earlier then the date was scheduled for install. The contract company called to set up installation. You would think wonderful it’s finally going to happen and low and behold the contractor goes to pick up the door to install and it has dents all over it. No one looked at the received item to ensure it wasn’t damaged. Now again I am waiting for doors and installation. Lowe’s failed on every level.

I got there and showed my order number. They said they do not have any. What they have belongs to someone else’s order. The problem with their system is, if someone orders something and has it delivered to their store, it goes on that Lowe’s store inventory until that person picks it up. Advice: if the website says the store has any in stock, call to verify that they do physically have it and it is not tied to someone else’s order.",0,1

Started calling them at 4:30. No answer or if someone answered was put on hold, then disconnected. Finally reached someone at about 6:30. They gave us the number to Lowes delivery company. Called them and they said we weren't even on the schedule and to call Lowes back. Asked them to call and patch us in. He called twice and got through but they hung up on him too. Finally decided to drive 30 minutes to the Lowes. Asked to speak to a manager. She asked what it was in reference to. I told her a delivery. She came back 20 minutes later with the phone number to the delivery company. I told her we had already talked to them and to get the manager. He came out 10 minutes later and asked how he could help me. I told him the story and he proceeded to tell me that the delivery company never showed up that day and showed me a 3 page list of all the people who didn't get their deliveries that day. Said are fridge was there but we couldn't get it until Wednesday which was three days later. He then said he couldn't guarantee that we would get it then because he had no control over the delivery company. After that experience, we weren't convinced we'd get it either so we told the manager we wanted to cancel that order as well as a dishwasher we purchased. He was VERY happy to get that order canceled. What happened to customer service? I read so many reviews where people weren't happy with Lowes but still gave them two and three stars. I've lost all trust in Lowes and trust is a hard thing to get back. I feel like I'm living in an upside down world.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Flooring sub contractors Disgusting,"Guess I have to give you one undeserved star to submit this. Your installers did not wear a mask one was rude. One was coughing, sneezing, blowing his nose and looked feverish. It was a gruesome experience. I have spoken with complaint department at Lowe’s and am being treated like I’m lying. I was asked for my video surveillance and my conversation with the Board of Health. Board of Health advised me to quarantine for 10 days or until the installer was tested. The only answer I received from Service Pros was he is feeling well but allergic to carpet. What? He is a carpet installer. I signed a contract with Lowe’s, paid for my service, allowed service people into a COVID free home( I am a senior citizen). Was treated poorly, and service pros did not even know the ill techs name. Which is appalling that they do not vet their people. He could have been a criminal. In my home. Myrtle Beach has a mandatory Mask requirement $250 fine not wearing it. I have video surveillance of them not wearing masks, I was asked by your company to send it. My attorney will send it. I have never been treated so poorly in my life. Service pros had the audacity to tell me to give 10’s on the survey... despite everything that happened. They stated they need a 10 because that’s how they get jobs from you. Unmarked vehicle, no identification, this was the most unprofessional experience ever. Service pros will not communicate with me. I’m not the bad guy here. They are. They are horrible.

Lowe's Companies,Poor service poor products wasted my time,"We purchased 3 ceiling fans on order # 718464979 from your store at 14960 S. Tamiami in Ft. Myers for parking lot pickup. They were brought and loaded into our vehicle. Once we got home and started to hang them we noticed that one was a return that had been previously installed. It had numerous screws missing which because I didn’t have time to return it managed to get installed only to find that it was crooked and couldn’t be fixed, hence the previous return. I ran to the store the next morning at 11am and exchanged it for an unopened one which was missing screws for the fan blades so we exchanged it again. I was leaving town that day so despite my best efforts it was not installed. When I returned the previously open one on 3/2/21 and explained the situation I received no apology of any kind and was given an in-store credit to purchase another one rather than doing an exchange. I thought your customer service person was completely dispassionate and uncaring for a customer service person. Check your time and date to see who it was. A younger black gentleman. We are in the process of remodeling our condo and were planning on buying some Pergo flooring and carpet from you but will be looking across the street at Home Depot for them. Maybe if you didn’t buy so many poor quality products from Chinese manufacturers this wouldn’t happen.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Customer Service policy variance,"Ordered two toilets on line & a Lowes installer for same. The Lowes installer returned the toilets to my local store. Lowes issued an immediate credit but later recharged me for the returned toilets. On the 2nd call to customer service, the problem seemed to be resolved with store manager promising a refund in 3-10 days. It did not come through. I was told to customer service in the event that the credit was not issued. I did & they said ""That is not our policy; we file incident reports"". They told me I needed to go to the store and talk with the manager myself. I have stage 4 cancer & must limit public exposure.

I ordered an expensive washer and dryer online and chatted with the guy in the online box to get the right ones and confirm delivery and pick up of old. Little did I know that Lowe's uses a third party delivery service which rents Enterprise trucks. Lowe's cannot communicate with them to change delivery dates, and the delivery guys dented the washer upon installation. I called Lowe's several times, and was told I should never order online...only in person. And i was told the guy I chatted with online in the chat box could be anywhere...like India. I had three customer service reps hang up on me, and three say they would call back and never did. I finally had all picked up and returned as I was told I needed to before I could get another non-dented washer, and was told they didn't have the parts in stock to install the gas dryer and didn't know when they would get them, and a week later, customer service told me they already refunded me , which they have not, and said they would investigate and call me back, which they have not.

My husband thought they had charged us for a second water heater so we go back to the person that wrote up the invoice and was told that the valve would need to be turned off and that a PVC pipe would need to be cut but we were not told that in the beginning so we told the guy no, it was too expensive.

Lowe's Companies,Worst Experience Purchasing an Appliance,"I recently purchased a dishwasher from Lowe's. I paid extra for my old dishwasher to be removed and discarded. The arrival time for my dishwasher was supposed to be somewhere between 8 am and 8 pm. This is a pretty big time window, but we received a call that we could expect the dishwasher to arrive between 12:00 and 4:00 pm. At 4:00 our dishwasher still had not arrived and no one had called. I called Lowe's asking about the status of my order. The lady told me it would arrive by 8:00 pm. I explained that it was supposed to be there by 4:00 pm. She said they were probably just running late. At this point, it was irritating, but not a huge deal. I was told that they would give us a call when they were 45 minutes away. That meant I had enough time to get some things done, I thought. 15 minutes later, I got a phone call saying that they were less than 10 minutes away! I immediately dropped all my plans to get home to have the dishwasher installed. When I arrived home, it turned out that they were not actually 10 minutes away. They did not arrive for another 35 minutes and had no explanation or apology for why they were late. At this point, I was even more irritated, but it was fine because the dishwasher was delivered. I was expecting everything to be smooth sailing from here. The people who delivered were not friendly. They asked (because apparently, they don't have any information available) if we purchased the removal of the old dishwasher. I told them that we did purchase removal. They claimed that they could not take it because it was not unplugged and removed from the wall. Nowhere did it say that we need to unplug and remove it. I assumed that ""removal"" implied that they would remove the dishwasher. They said that if I could remove it before they got the new one in they would take it. They offered no help in removing it and literally watched me struggle and complained about how they were already running late. Finally, I got the old dishwasher out and I was excited to get the new one installed. When I had called Lowe's previously, they ensured me that it would be ""easy"" to install a new dishwasher and that I would not need to pay $179 for installation. Now, this might have been true if our dishwasher had not been missing the manual. Not sure if this is Lowe's fault or the manufacturers. We searched every nook and cranny of the dishwasher and the packaging and there was no manual. As most people do, we resorted to Youtube. After spending a few hours looking at Youtube videos, we agreed that we are not experts and it would be best to call someone to help install it. Naturally, since we bought the dishwasher from Lowe's we called Lowe's.At this point, I was beyond irritated, I was furious, but I kept calm and was very pleasant trying to get someone on the phone. When I dialed, it gave me a specific number to purchase installation. When I pressed the number, I was transferred to flooring. The person at flooring seemed to have no idea why I was transferred there, but he said he would transfer me to appliances. I was put on hold and then I was transferred again, but I was not transferred to appliances. I don't even know where I was transferred to, but it was not the right place. The lady assured me that she would transfer me to appliances.After spending a half-hour on the phone, I finally reached appliances. At this point, I was ticked, but I was happy to at least be in the right department where someone could help me set up an installation, or at least that is what I thought. I explained my situation and asked if it would be possible to set up an installation. I was told that installation would be $179. That wasn't a huge issue. I figured we would have to pay for the service. It seemed a bit pricey considering we bought the dishwasher from them, but I just wanted it installed. After explaining the price, the lady informed me that in order to set up an installation, I would have to drive to the store and sign a contract. I had everything that I could do not to explode on this lady. I did not because I know it was not entirely her fault. At this point, I was done with Lowe's. We are currently back to Youtube trying to install it ourselves. I should have purchased the slightly more expensive dishwasher at Menards. Honestly, I might try to contact them to see if I can some sort of refund for all of the time that I wasted. I am zero percent impressed and their lack of communication and customer service is extremely disappointing.Just an update: I was really hoping that Lowe's would redeem themselves after this review and after my calling to file a complaint. It has been well over a month now and I have heard nothing from Lowe's. They have done nothing to make the situation right. From now on, I will be encouraging everyone I know to take their business elsewhere.",0,1

They had me sign for the partial order and it was apparent they weren't well trained. I asked them to verify that the shower head was still on order and the young me man said yes. I came back on February 8th and there was nothing on order. The girl was fortunately able to look up my receipt. She also told me I could go back to plumbing and check to see if it was there if I wanted. Again, this is the customer service desk. She then told me she could re-order it or I could just go get it from a different Lowes. I opted for re-order which was dumb. I came back in on February 22nd because I never heard from them. The girl said the system showed one had been delivered but was no longer there and it would be several more weeks before my order came in. I asked for a refund at this point.The sad thing is the people at this store are great. Almost all of them are helpful and friendly. The management is incompetent.

One checkout clerk kept calling me ""Ma'am"", but anyone could tell by my size and full beard that I am not a ""ma'am"". To add insult to injury, when I went to pay (money!) I simply asked the checkout clerk in the line that I was in, how much the insulation was that I had purchased. She continued to ask questions pertaining to what I was talking about, but it was not hard to understand that I was asking about the price, and I even continued to say so. But nonetheless, she acted as if I were stupid! She kept reading of the specifications of the insulation but could not tell me what the price was. Now I had spent two hours in that store, and by now I am getting hot. At the last, I told her that if she could not tell me the price, then she could cancel the order. Finally she said ""I do not know what you are trying to ask"". That was it. I simply smiled and said, ""have fun putting it all back"", and walked off. My whole morning was shot! So off to Home Depot I went. It took me almost an hour to get to Home Depot, but it was worth it. They were really nice, and I did not suffer PTSD for being in their store.

It would’ve been fine except when I walked them out, I realized my door cannot lock. I called thinking they can just come back and Align the screws. Nope they lied and said they never took the door down. Spoke to several people to have this taken care off and All very rude. Unprofessional and in the end I have to pay someone to come out. Well!! I will be sending Lowe’s the bill. Such a simple mistake and they have turned it into something major. I’ve spent over $7000 this year alone trying to redo my kitchen. Well I guess I’ll take my money to Home Depot. Customer service is very poor. But I have options.",0,1

Called store and they disconnect you ! 1-800 line tells you wait 24 hrs and a manager will call ? That never happened. So I guess in the midst of Covid I need to drive 90 miles to a Lowe’s store to get my monies back for they can take money over the phone but can’t seem to refund it over the phone. Beyond disappointed & frustrated. Actually , the 3rd party delivery guys were nice , professional and courteous. As far as any Lowe’s person , nobody has helped. They all pass along and someone in corporate should maybe call the Panama City store and see how your just transferred to dead lines !

The guy that they sent to install our chain link fence did a disastrous job. He did not dig the holes deep enough for the cemented poles. He left large gaps where our block wall meets the chain link, on both sides of our property. The gap between one of the gates and the fencing was so bad that the latch practically did nothing to hold the gate shut. When rolling our main gate shut there was an 8 inch gap where the gate was supposed to evenly meet the fence on the other side. He didn't place metal ties at the very bottom of the poles. Lowe's did practically nothing for us. They showed very little concern. Now we're stuck with a mess. A costly mess. I hate this company and I warn everyone that I can not to approach them.",0,1

After the installation of the bathroom floors turned into a horror show, including disappearing workers, I found a new company to install my wood floors. (Flowers Flooring - Great company.) So far, the vanity is still not finished. It arrived with pieces missing, the faucet sprayed water everywhere, re-ordered missing pieces, 2nd order came in with pieces damaged, re-ordered faucet, then discovered the faucet holes in the vanity top were not drilled correctly. Re-ordered the top, still waiting......Part of the hold-up on the vanity was also due to the flooring installers not knowing how to install the floors in the first place, having to re-do them, Lowe's not sending the correct material and the workers disappearing. And, to add icing to the cake, Lowe's not following the state mandated rules regarding masks.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Store 2391,"Store 2391.. purchased a washer and dryer machine, and upon delivery they did not have the stack kit for the machine. and they did not have the right plug for the dryer. The driver made a call to his Lowe's contact, who instructed we call the store, tell the appliance dept. that they had missed selling us the stacking kit, purchase the kit, and that the delivery/installer would be back the next day to complete the installation. Upon contacting the appliance dept. about the missing part, they stated that the stacking kit, for our units, had not been in stock for almost a year. I was given the part of the stacking kit and told that it was available through Amazon. Next day service from Amazon, but 3 more days to get Lowe's back to complete the installation. The next set of installers show up today and stacked the units but then announced to us the dryer vent hose was the wrong hose for a stackable. So we had to go back to the store and make the switch. Long story short... we had to complete the installation ourselves. While at the store, I had the misfortune of dealing with the salesmen that sold us the units. I asked him to explain to me why units would be on the sales floor stacked and no kit was included in the package purchased. I was told that washer and dryers THAT CAN BE STACKED are one on top of each other to save space. ok... so why didn't you ask us if we were going to stack them? The response I got was ""WELL MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THEY WON'T BE STACKED and implied, by the tone in his voice, it was our fault for not telling him and that we should have known what we were doing.

Lowe's Companies,They don't deserve your money!,"Never a problem with Lowes, until my recent carpet experience. We ordered carpet on November 30, 2020. Today was the final day they were at our house. We were told on November 30th that it would be 10- 14 days until carpet was ordered and in, it would take an additional day to arrive at the outside company for installation (ULTIMATE Home Services). We didn't hear back from anyone after multiple calls until after Christmas. They then told us they would schedule the installation so we thought okay it had taken longer than expected but we would be getting carpet soon. We had four rooms to carpet and they came and measured it all themselves to make sure they ordered enough. The installers arrived at our house a couple weeks ago to tell us they were 1 room short of carpet, they knew coming that they wouldn't have enough and NO ONE CALLED US. I took the day off of work and still the project was not complete. Now we have to wait a couple more weeks to get more carpet for 1 room, to which we received a call that they no longer offer the ""Dye number"" for. So not only do we not have carpet for all four but one will be a different carpet all together. We were communicating with both Lowes and Ultimate Home Services to make sure it was going to be a rush and we weren't going to get pushed to the back. They then collaborate together and set us up for another install. We receive a call that day to let us know they WONT BE COMING! After we have now moved one of our kids room out of the space TWICE. We call obviously upset and they PROMISE they will be to our house the following day at 8:30am. We got a call before 8 saying they won't be there until 1pm! If you want to be jerked around get your carpet with Lowes, if not I suggest doing more research and finding somewhere else.",0,1

We recently spent about $5k redoing our kitchen from with tile and supplies from Lowe’s. I came in looking for oversized outlet covers. The guy in electrical so unprofessional and outright rude! The shelf was empty, my son stood beside it after looking for the skew number for it in boxes above. When I inquired with the gentleman, he asked rudely why I needed the oversized outlet covers, “what do u have a big hole on ur wall or something”. I explained actually yes, we have a very old home with old electric. He said , “ we’ll if you don’t see it the we don’t have it”. I explained we’ve been looking at boxes above and there are a lot more not shelved, as I pointed to the item on the shelf that was missing. He told me again if we don’t see it they don’t have it! I thanked him for not even looking and explained we have been looking ourselves above. As I walked away he very rudely yelled, “we’ll do u want me to look then?”! I was shocked, he was loud, obnoxious and Lowe’s customer service has really gone down! After spending so much money at a store, they’re really not invested in keeping their customers.

Not only that, but they won't replace the wrong item that they sent unless you buy a new one right now - they won't do a like for like exchange. Not their ""policy"".What a waste of time and money.

Damaged new flooring: The contractor put heavy equipment on the new flooring he had just installed.4. Plumbing damage in bathroom where the new ceramic tile is installed unevenly. Lowes failed to resolve these issues in a timely manner (it's 2 years later!!!), so now the bamboo and ceramic flooring we originally chose has been discontinued. The only similar bamboo option they can offer us is $1.20/sq foot more but they are unwilling to spend this extra money. There are no ceramic flooring options even close to what we originally wanted and paid for. They seem to feel it's completely reasonable to ask us to pay for the difference in price, regardless of the countless hours that my husband and I lost from work to be home for the contractors that would show up late, OR NOT AT ALL, and countless hours we have spent on the phone back and forth with their unknowledgeable representatives.

Finally said ""they just came in today"" Never heard from anyone to install, called again weeks later and was told ""they just came in today"" What a racket. Windows were finally installed and Lowes rep said we were given the wrong grid on one of them but Lowes would reorder. County checked windows they were ok, Lowes returned to finish and found a large crack in one window. We were told it would be replaced. That was months ago. Called Lowes repeatedly and never an answer. Then Lowes moved their headquarters for window installation to another state. I found this out by the company who contracts, not Lowes because no one there EVER answers a phone. Installer got me a contact number at the new headquarters, Diane Hawkins who informed me the 2 windows would be reordered but permit has expired to install and she would reapply and get back to me. She told me I could call her anytime. Again, over a month ago. We were delived 1 window, the wrong grid of course so it's useless. I called Diane (at least 4 times) and left messages to tell her about wrong window and she NEVER returned my call. I was told new person now had my account, of course Diane could have told me this had she called back. Left a message for new person, Ashley, and again no return call. Finally got a supervisor last week who said no permit was reapplied for and no new windows were ordered. He guaranteed I would get a call back from someone yesterday (2/9) by 5pm to update me. Of course no one ever called so I will have to call again today. So, I have new windows, one with the wrong grid and one with a 12in crack in it and I live in a hurricane state. I also have a 3 year old and if he touches the window it could fall on him. Not to mention of course a window in my garage that is useless and a hazard as it is glass. Honestly, I couldn't make all of this up.If you buy windows from Lowes just know that there is no follow-up, they do not stand behind their guarantee and no one EVER answers the phone or calls you back. I am now doubting the effectiveness of these ""hurricane"" windows. This is the worse customer service I have ever received and I refuse to buy anything ever again at Lowes, even if it's just a nail.

I won’t give all the details of that debacle but will say Lowe’s sent two sketchy contractors to do the work and they didn’t have both doors (one had been damaged by Lowe’s), they didn’t have the extra siding to fix around my garage door. It was long and drawn out and unprofessional. I still am not sure to this day why the salesperson charged me $1200 for installation on top of the price of doors. I was originally told by Harold that the slider door was $800 and a side garage door $150. Total bill for two doors $2800! The contractor didn’t clean up and was in a hurry to go. None of it makes sense and no one at Lowe’s cares to fix it. Corporate has called me a couple times to get details but no correction on my bill as of today. We just received our new screen door but they do not have anyone to send out to install & our slider doesn’t close smoothly. Overall it was disappointing to deal with Lowe’s. I do not recommend them for any job!",0,1

Donʻt fall for this scheme. We ordered a new stackable washing machine, same size as our old one. The delivery guys showed up and said they couldnʻt install it unless we bought a new dryer as well. TOTAL BS!! Then they told us that they could leave the washing machine for us to install ourselves, EVEN THOUGH WE ALREADY PAID FOR INSTALLATION AND TAKEAWAY. MORE BS!! I told them to cancel the order. Then they asked to come in the house and take a picture of the washer dryer....WHY? They wanted pictures even if they werenʻt going to do the job. I said HELL NO! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND UNPROFESSIONAL LAZY DELIVERY GUYS WHO DONʻT CARE OR WANT TO DO THEIR JOB!! No thanks, Lowes.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes is the Donald Trump of Stores,"I ordered a snowblower and was told it would be delivered in two days. Two days went by and no delivery, even though Lowes confirmed that morning delivery on the date it was due. I went on the website and they lied by representing the item as ""shipped"" when Fed Ex Ground never received the package. They insisted it shipped because they consider it shipped when a shipping label is printed out. No, an item is SHIPPED when their carrier takes possession of the item you order.I contacted their third party vendor and gave them the order and tracking number and low and behold, they told me IT WOULD SHIP IN 1-2 WEEKS. Of course, Lowes had full knowledge of this and simply do not give a rat's ass about their customers.This is how much they give a steaming pile of you know what about their customers....One weekend we went into the store to find that 8 of their employees have the slightest idea that you cover your nose up when wearing a mask. We reported it to management and this is how much they took care of it...We returned the following weekend and 11 people were wearing the masks incorrectly. When we told the manager that she in fact wasn't wearing her mask correctly the previous weekend, she actually called us liars. She went ballistic when I whipped out my cellphone to show her a pic of her not wearing properly the following weekend. I congratulated her that she was about to become an internet star. later that afternoon.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Don't care about customers.,"Whatever you do don't order any installs from any Lowe's. We ordered windows from Lowe's. They placed the order with Pella and outsourced the install. Once they had our money they completely wash their hands of you and leave you at the mercy of their suppliers. We ordered first week in Sept and were told late Oct for window delivery. In Oct we were told Dec due to covid. I called in 6 times in Dec and received 6 different delivery dates. All Lowe's would tell me is those are the estimates from Pella and there was nothing they could do.The windows finally were delivered early Jan. I then had to schedule the install with the company they outsourced to. We had to wait 3 weeks for the install and then 30 mins before they are supposed to be there the company called because they had to reschedule. We finally got out windows installed in Feb.When I talked with Lowe's about the bad experience they said they didn't do anything wrong or cause any delays so there is nothing they can do. I reminded them I ordered the windows through lowe's and it was lowe's responsibility to advocate for their customers with their vendors and manage those vendors Lowes representative had no clue what I was talking about and said he could only offer a $50 gift card even though the window order was over $7,000.Will never order anything or any service with them again.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Ridiculous Delivery/Haul Away/ Install Process,"At Edinburg, TX store - Ordered three kitchen appliances, and was told it would take 3 weeks for delivery (although the items were in stock in the store). We paid for haul away service for all 3. When speaking to someone in the store previously, we were told that the appliances would be installed when delivered. After ordering, I called, just to confirm, and was then told that this was totally separate (unless it is just plugging an item into the wall - that is what they meant my installation when I asked in the store). So, we had to go back down to the store where they then told us they didn't see the haul away service request. We showed the manager of this department the invoice where it had already been paid. He told us he needed to delete that order out, recharge for it and also charge another $300.00 to install. They assured my husband that it would all be scheduled for the SAME day - not the same time necessarily, but that the delivery of the new appliances and haul off of the old ones would be done, and then later that same day the installation team would be by to install. A few days ago, the delivery team called to confirm delivery date, and told my husband the installation would be done three days later. They said they don't know why the manager in the store told us that it would be scheduled for the same date, but that it doesn't work that way. We attempted to call the manager back, but he has dodged all calls up to this point. Delivery was made this morning, but the guy told my husband that they would only haul off the new range, and that for the items that need to be installed a separate haul away date would need to be set up. My husband asked why he can't just take these items now, and he told my husband he doesn't get paid to do that. Another call to the store, and again the manager dodged, but a very nice young lady let us know that she was very sorry and could see where this was in the system, but we would now have to set up a new date if the guy could not remove the other stuff. The guy said he ""could"" remove them, but was not going to because he isn't paid enough to do so. So, now I have two new appliances sitting in my kitchen that won't be installed until Friday. Then, a separate haul away team is ""supposed"" to come out on Friday to pick those up, but they can't guarantee it will be Friday though. Prior to now, we have been long time customers of Lowes. But, after this, we won't be buying from here anymore. After seeing so many similar reviews online, I would have thought that Lowe's corporate would have worked out a better solution to these problems for their customers.",0,1

They removed all the old carpets and padding. Started to install the living room and they were going to put a seam across the width of the room. I stopped this and insisted they do the bedroom with the carpeting they had, because it is common knowledge NOT to put a seam across the middle of the high traffic area of the living room. So now I have padding in both hallways and living room with no carpet. Ordering additional carpeting is going to take 7-10 days to receive from warehouse and another week to reschedule install. I have my couch and love seat in my kitchen, TV and stand in my bedroom. No one from Lowes called me, I had to call them several times.

Lowe's Companies,The store in JC,"The store in JC, TN has left me dumb-founded at just how inept an entire organization can be... but - our fault, we went there.1st, if u have been in any Lowes lately we all know that finding someone to assist is next to impossible but this store seems to have perfected the 'hide & seek' aspect of service. I actually even had a clerk turn & walk away from me after answering ONE ?. I had explained that the 'how to' of this undertaking was not familiar to me -- hoping that this would clue him in to the possibility that I might be in need of information, a 'crash course' in best material for the job, how much and what all materials would be needed, etc. Again, he turned and left after one question. Unprofessional? Completely!! & rude beyond measure. I have yet to be asked by one person in that store if I needed assistance.2nd: we had to practically pull teeth in order to get our bought & paid for materials. We were told 4 different delivery dates, times, rc'd a fourth of purchase then had to fight to receive the rest. We were told on 5 different times the store manager would call us... ofcourse, still waiting. Told store mngr was working when he wasn't so on and so forth. No one knows what is happening. No one can step up and take responsibility -- all problems are left to ""I can't answer that, I will send an email and get an answer tomorrow"" Geez that must be a busy email wizard. I had to call Corporate in order to even talk with someone and, though she was nice and listened, the store still changed what she had said. Lowes used to be a useful store. Their employees actually had knowledge in what they were selling and they actually wanted to help you make an informed decision. I don't know how many times I have asked for a certain type of item, told they 'don't carry anything like that' only to find it or something similar while walking the aisles. I have been 4 times now waiting to talk with someone about blinds but still have not been able to. Though was advised one time by the sales person that she would be right w/me (1/2 an hr later) still waiting - I left. Will go to a blind store!So, this store , this company, from what my husband and I have experienced (& from numerous others opinions) from any and all Lowes lately is: they are not what they used to be, not professional, not responsible, no one knows what is going on and they do not care to find out, they give info that they seem to pull out of...thin air!

Lowe's Companies,If I could give a zero,"If I could give a zero, I would. I had waited months for a specific item to arrive back in stock. I went so far as to contact the manufacturer to see when the item would be available. I also asked all local stores to email me when the item became available. Much to my pleasant surprise, the item, a sliding shower door by Ove became available, but not because any store let me know it was back in stock, it was because I checked online. I quickly contacted the local Lowes store and was told by the supervisor individual in the Millworks department that I should wait until the opening had been measured by the installer before ordering. I told the guy, this was a in high demand item with not a lot in stock, and that I felt I should order it right then. He said no, wait, that if it sold out in the region, he could pull it from another region. That, turned out to be a LIE! 6 days later the installer came out, and what a piece of work he was. He ""Mansplained"" to me, a former contractor for twenty years ( and a woman), that they would have to charge extra to cut down the sides to fit the space. ( It's aluminum metal with two caps on the end which would hide any scratches once cut on a chop saw with a metal cutting wheel, not hard to do). I said Ok, but if it's any more than $40-50, then I'm being gouged. He got an attitude, Oh, who am I kidding, he had an attitude from the minute he walked through the door. Didn't introduce himself, No business card, and he got mad that I wanted to take a pic of his photo id on the lanyard he wore. I said, send me the quote, and we'll take it from there. After he left, I called my builder and he said he'd be happy to do it, because quite frankly I don't want that Lowes guy in my house. Then I went to order the item, and guess what? Now, it's no longer in stock, AGAIN! So, after a meltdown, I will have to once more, wait months to get this item, and I'll keep it inhouse this time. Point being, if you know your stuff, don't listen to Lowes personnel, they either don't know what they're talking about, or they're outright lies. A follow up. Three days later, I got online, and magically 11 of the type of sliding shower doors had become available ( shipped from the Washington, DC area). I quickly made the purchase, and made arrangements for my builder to install it. Several days later, I went to Lowes to talk to the Millworks supervisor. He profusely apologized, and said the installer had a list of complaints an inch thick, and hoped my complaint might be enough to get him fired. Question. Why is Lowes using anyone that makes them look so bad? It turned out, they had ONE shower door in stock, and I picked it up right then. My builder installed it a week later. Finally, success! But boy, what a rollercoaster experience.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Horrible,"Horrible. We had a backsplash installed through Lowe’s and the job was done horribly. The contractors distorted my front yard, my walls and cabinets. They had to rip out my walls to have it redone. This took 2 months. Along the way I was cancelled on with appointments that were made. I had major language barriers and was unable to communicate with the contractors at Service Pros. I was told I would be compensated for a 2000 dollar project and was offered 100 dollars. I will never go through Lowe’s for any home projects again. The unprofessionalism and lack of accountability of service pros and Lowe’s contracting out to them is unacceptable.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Let me start off saying that this place…,"Let me start off saying that this place has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. The first employee I said something to kept ignoring me like I wasn't saying anything. Then I asked her do they sale and cut mirrors? She said she didn't know as they were calling for someone to come to cut some glass over the intercom. Then she led me to another employee that said no they didn't do that but the other employee next to him said yes they do. He said that I had to buy the glass there, I was like no chit Sherlock smh. This employee led me to a guy that was making keys. I started to explain to the employee what I needed but he went off on me telling me he had another customer. Then he spent 30 minutes helping a guy with a door lock that they didn't even have in stock. Now a 5th employee came and told me that the glass cutter wasn't working and then he told me to go to their competition Home Depot. This was a waste of my time. I felt like they were lying so I called and asked were they cutting glass today and they said yes. I figured they were lying because it came over the intercom at least twice. If anyone say that this Lowe's is any good, they are lying. I will never go to Lowe's again. This Lowe's is Southaven on Goodman Rd",0,1
Lowe's Companies,The Lowe’s in my town clearly doesn’t give a ?$*!!,"The Lowe’s in my town clearly has no respect or concern for its employees or customers. Every time I go there (we don’t have much of an alternative for DIY home repairs), I see more and more customers who aren’t wearing masks. There’s no one stationed at the entry- ways asking people to wear masks, few, if any, automated announcements, and I’ve never seen an employee or manager say anything to one of these jerks. In NC, masks are the law, but if corporations refuse to enforce the mandate, selfish individuals will do whatever they want, regardless of their actions’ effects on the innocent folks who are following the law. It really is shameful. Lowe’s chocks their inaction off to a concern for their employees. If they really cared about their employees, they’d give them raises or, at the very least, do their part to ensure that they won’t contract a potentially deadly disease while they’re at work.",0,1

The washer I had gotten from an appliance store I have always used and I also had originally ordered the dryer at the same time on Nov. 5 of 2020. Got the washer about 10 days later. BUT....the dryer did not come so I finally gave up on them and canceled the order and got a refund. Went to Lowes to see what they had and they had the same dryer in stock and they even price matched. Way to go Lowes.Since I was so pleased I went and bought $1500 of flooring from Lowes to do our kitchen floor in a few days. You guys rock!",0,5
Lowe's Companies,Bad Customer Service.,I ordered a livingroom set from Lowe's and I only received the sofa and loveseat. Unfortunately my chair never was delivered so I asked why the chair was not delivered and the delivery person could not answer. I waited about 3-4 weeks and still I did not receive anything. I called customer service and that person gave me an incident report number and that I should receive a call within 2 days. I called 5 days later and that person said I had to wait 10 days. It is now a month after the fact and I have not received a follow-up or email about the status of my purchase. Today I called again and a lady informed me that it was just a complaint and there was never going to be a follow up. So now I am really mad and now she tells me within 24 hours a manager will call for a follow-up. We will see what they tell me. At this point I just want a refund.,0,1

Lowe's Companies,Purchased a Jeld-Wen Slider door from…,"Purchased a Jeld-Wen Slider door from Hendersonville Tennessee Lowe’s on May 29 of 2020. Purchase was done through Lowe’s Credit card because of interest free financing for a 12 month period. This door was a custom build and was 153 inches long by 89 inches. A 4 panel slider with the 2 center doors as the in/out. The door was scheduled to be at the store in Hendersonville on July 10th which it was but, during transit on US Holland (LTL) Freight, Lowe’s would not accept delivery due to the unit being damaged in shipment. Great call Lowe’s and the right thing to do at the time. Now, here is where the story gets muddy. Lowe’s did not prioritize the second order prompting Jeld-Wen to drop the ball on building a second door. Jeld-Wen decided to use the or play the “China Virus” issues in slow walking the construction of the second door. During this time, I drove to Lowe’s multiple times but could never meet with the G.M. He simply would hide behind the corporate shield and let his employees try to fix the issue. This story is really funny because I received phone calls from North Wilksboro, North Carolina (Lowe’s Corporate Office) asking about the installation of my new slider (twice). I would always let the customer service representative tell her complete story until I busted her chops and said: we don’t have a new door, and we don’t even have a new door on our property. Of course she would always use the standard concerned answer of: I need to look into this and get back with you. Guess what, they never get back with you. Skipping ahead and not going into details, a new door finally arrive in early December at my Lowe’s store only to be informed that the installers (sub-contractor) could not install it until January 6th of 2021. Remember, we bought the door on May 29th 2020. The installers actually did a good job installing the unit except the door does not lock properly and with not much force opens with the lock in. Jeld-Wen has been notified but with no assistance except an email with no video as promised. Bottom line: I have a 6000.00 door that want lock. When purchasing a door of this caliber, go through a true door and window distributor for first class service, never use a bug box retailer. Totally my fault as I know better. Never again will I buy something custom from Lowe’s. Oh by the way, we just had a new Ace Hardware in Hendersonville open up and I plan to by tools from them. I may pay more but I will get service. “Choices make America Great” I and have choices that I can use.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Purchased a refrigerator,"Purchased a refrigerator, ice maker, and 3 year warranty on 1-2-21. Was told it was in warehouse and would be delivered on 1-14-21. Store called and said it would be delivered between 9:00 to 1:00. At 2:00 called store and was told it was on afternoon truck so would be delivered before 5:00. At 6:00 still no refrigerator, so called the store and was told they made a mistake refrigerator will not be in until February. I asked to talk to Manager and was transferred and they either lost my call or hung up. Called back no Manager available and this person told me the refrigerator would not be in until April. Could not get refund because a Manager has to do that. So I call the Corp Office and go thru the whole ordeal and I am told to calm down. This gentlemen tells me that he gave it an incident number the the Lowes Store would call me back and make it right that same day. Two days later I call the store again and this time I do get a Manager and he tells me that it was refunded. I ask why was I not called and he did not know. Thank god before I hung up I asked him how much was my refund. They only refunded me for the refrigerator and the ice maker but not the warranty!? So then have to be put on hold to see what can be done??!! He gets back on line and said he refunded the warranty. So if I had not ask they would of kept $100 of mine and by the time my statement came they might of tried to say it was to long to give a refunded. He did not have an answer for that. Now keep in mind that I bought the refrigerator in Texas for my Son and I live in Illinois. So all the calls I made and waited on hold were long distance. What I poor way to do business. I will never do business with a Lowes again. I will make sure everyone I know is told about Lowes. I also had complaint on how they treat military members - so they burned my family twice and we only received a half felt sorry. Was told we would not get a refrigerator any sooner from them too.

On Sunday, January 17th Service Pro called to inform us they could do the installation on Thursday, January 21st. It the installation was scheduled much sooner than expected. I took the day off from work to be home when they arrived to do the install. Service Pro was supposed to call and confirm. They never did. So on Thursday the 21st (day of installation) I called service pro and was informed that my order was cancelled because they did not have any installers available for the day scheduled. NO ONE from Lowe's or Service Pro called to inform us of this or to re-schedule. I guess it's a good thing I took the initiative to call myself. I took the entire day off of work (with out pay) and now I have to take another day off for the installation, again no pay. All Lowe's could do was take $100.00 of the total price of the installation. I was tempted to return all the merchandise back to Lowe's but I would have to borrow a truck again.

Lowe's Companies,Worst experience ever.,"I don’t think I ever experienced such bad customer service at any stores ever in my life. Makes me believe that this is Lowe’s policy “do not help customers”. This happened at location Buford, Ga 30519. However, other locations I visited in the past, I noticed the same attitude, no interest in helping. I was shopping for 2 sets of complete shower and faucets, remodeling 2 bathrooms. One evening I was at the store trying to figure out brand, model, colors, etc. I was literally sitting on the floor looking at different options. Employees past by, but didn’t bother to ask if I need help. I left the store disappointed. The next morning went to another location, Suwanee GA. A young lady came by because the sensor on the shower set I was holding, start beeping. I asked her if she knows anything about faucets and stuff, she said not really and walked away. I end up buying 2 sets and went to the Buford location. I wasn't happy with the style plus I need it faucets to match. Again spending a lot of time looking, finally I requested help. They page twice, but still nobody came to help. I was furious, and I picked something and went to returns area to exchange my showers and check out. I told the young lady how frustrated I was and she tried to get someone again to help me. I waited, not sure for how long, at this point any minute was too long. Gave up and left, but did purchase shower sets (2) and 3 faucets, spent about $900. If I wasn’t in rush to finish my project at the house, I would not have purchased from Lowe’s. Lowe’s, you don’t stand a chance to Home Depot. I doesn’t look like you care at all, after reading other reviews.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,VERY SAD STORE!,If I could give this store #447 a rating of less than 1 star I would. I went to my local store and had an associate verify if they had a door in stock he told me no and then proceeded to tell me that there was 39 in stock at #447 and verified the price would be the same because this was a close out product on clearance. Now I drive around 40 minutes to get to the store to have an associate then tell me that oh yeah I know the stock number your looking for but ours isn't on sale. Let me ask you is this store the only one that has the same barcode on these doors and they aren't on sale. This sounds shady to me! I WOULD LIKE TO SAY DONT SHOP HERE!!!,0,1

The refrigerator we purchased was marked down by the manufacture, not Lowes (Home Depot has the exact same price. But they take credit for it ! This negated the Military Discount. I could of purchased it a home depot and Still got the discount. Why drive 20 miles for the same price ? I have been a loyal customer , Very disappointed .",0,3

I said yes, and the person confirmed they would be ready by 1pm the next day. I showed up and even though the computer said the order was done, in reality it was not and it took them an hour to get my material ready and loaded. Very unhappy to miss an appointment. Someone is not accurately tracking their work, and from the employee reaction this occurance is common. Customer service did not apologize when I complained or even offer to look into why their system showed ready, but in fact my order wasn't. Someone needs to get in there and fix their systems and accountability for online pickup experience.",0,2

Twelve days after purchase and not hearing anything, I called to be told it was scduled for install 4 weeks after the purchase. They did say they were going to get on this and probably get it installed in another 10 days. This puts install 3 weeks after purchase, not 10 days!!.

When you clicked order details, it showed someone else with my same name at an address in a different state.I called Lowe's and they did not seem that concerned. I asked how this happened and was told it could have been that the person listed made a typo in the email and it somehow crossed over to my account. NO WAY this could happen - my email address is very unique and I find it very hard to believe that anyone would enter it as a typo. This is a very scary situation - if I was a scammer, I would have had this persons name, address and Lowe's account number. I will not be setting up an online account with Lowe's again - if this were to happen with my account information, and, if I had lsaved credit card info, who knows what might happen. Be warned.",0,1

Then I was told by Mark, it would be January 10th! Lie number 3. Then I spoke to Andy last Saturday (Jan. 9th) and he said it was there at the store and he was going to tag it with my name and someone would be calling me on Monday Jan11th to install it. That was lie number 4. So I called and ask to speak to Andy, and was amazingly told (after they asked me my name) that he wasn't there, but they would get a message to him and have him call. I am guessing that will be lie number 5! If I don't receive a call by the end of the day, my next call will be to the Better Business Bureau!! Let me warn you!

Sadly at this point I would gladly take my old appliances back. And like a fool I purchased everything from Lowe's, they were so kind on the front end but good luck getting any help after the sale and the items have problems. They will jump behind that ""30 day"" clause so quickly it will make your head turn. Currently out of 6 new appliances three of them are not working. I tried reaching someone for almost two weeks with no response. Finally called and spoke with someone in customer service who actually listened and returned my call. The department manager and store manager didn't have the nerve to call back and instead had the poor girl at the front desk deliver the news that basically they just don't care.So... word to the wise, it might cost a few more dollars to deal with a local business over a large chain but the extra expense will be well worth it. I have a large order waiting for payment there and they will be waiting a long time before I spend any more money with them.

Lowe's Companies,Don't Buy Lowe's Extended Protection Plans,"We , bought the Lowe's Extended Protection Plan - in which it states (in part) that they promise PROMPT repair/replacement of your major appliance (in this case, a refrigerator) - we called the Lowe's EPP number on Nov. 2, 2020. It took them 2 days to ""find a repair company"" (they claim we are outside their primary service area - THAT is not discussed at time or purchase nor in their contract). They finally had A&E (formerly Sears) call and tell us the earliest dates was Nov. 25 between 8a-5p (even the lame cable companies offer a 4 hours window!) Nov. 25 comes and we get a call that the tech has driven his truck off the road and (drumroll) it will be Dec. 21 (again between 8a-5p) before they can re-schedule even though it was their error! Dec. 21 comes - tech actually shows up - determines we need a whole new door and it must be ordered from GE. Next service date is Jan. 8 - we call around 12:30pm on Jan. 8 to get a status update - only to find out that tech claims he tried to call, could not reach us and we have been cancelled and re-scheduled!! No second call attempt. Can you believe this!!

On black Friday mom and I found a refrigerator for both of us, and a washer,dryer combo with pedestal. We signed for the house on December 9th. We had set up delivery for the 10th. Unfortunately, this was not going to be the great experience that I was expecting. It is now January 7th and I still don't have my permanent refrigerator. I received my refrigerator and a washer machine on the 11th but they wouldn't bring them into the house to set up. They were dropped in my garage and left saying set up was not part of deal. I got the run around about when the rest of my order would come and when it was going to be installed. I had to call different stores. I was on hold for 3 hours to get answers. On the 13th they came and were going to hook up my washer machine and fridge. When they took them out of the cardboard box the fridge had many dents in the front of it. They connected the washer machine without issue. We decided to leave the fridge in the garage hooked up to be used for a little bit, till we could get the permanent one here. On the 18th my moms fridge came. On the 22nd my dryer came. Both without issue. It is now January 7th and I still didn't have a fridge in my kitchen. I still have no idea when I will get it.

Lowe's Companies,Actually can't believe I didn't look…,Actually can't believe I didn't look here before I made my purchase! Do not ever think about buying an appliance to Lowe's they probably don't own any of them or if they do the middleman company they used to ship and provide delivery service is horrible. They cancel a half hour before the delivery window starts don't know when it'll be available. I arranged my whole Saturday for this delivery and was insured it would be here. They don't care about customers or their schedules or anything else we have going on in our lives apparently. Stay away from Lowe's.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Don't even think of doing business,"I have had so many bad experiences with our local Lowe's. I needed to buy my elderly mom a dishwasher and tried every other company but them as she lives across the country. However, local to her lowes was the only company close to her that would deliver and install. First calling to ensure availability was terrible as their website won't confirm they can for sure do all the services. Trying to get to a booking agent was terrible and hours long over a few days just for a 5 minute conversation. I never got ahold of them. I called 4 stores in Myrtle Beach for an hour a day for 2 days..before someone actually answered the phone. The gentleman in appliances assured me they Could install and deliver to her home. I combed the website for a product for her as their stock was low and options limited. I found a product and ordered. Then I received a message to call on availability. I spent 2 hours on hold to speak to a scheduling agent who told me that even though they sold me a dishwasher they didn't actually have that one anymore. So back to the drawing board at this point I spoiled the surprise and just had my mom pick one out over about 3 more hours of searching because you have to search each store individually it won't just tell you if the product is available at a nearby store. We order a product exhale from exhaustion and she apologizes because itst been such a ridiculous process. Meanwhile she has been handwashing dishes with super arthritic hands for 2 weeks at this point because I had to break this up over several days with all of the complications. About 2 hours after, she gets a call from the store where the lady is trying to put her dishwasher on the truck for delivery but can't find it and says they are out. I had already paid for this but she ensures mom she'll fix that. No offer of finding from another store or anything. So next day we go back to searching nervously because we obviously can't trust the stock. She picks out a new one we schedule delivery. This time she has to wait 10 days for delivery. I apologise again and tell her I tried, I really did. At this juncture this is her xmas present and it's been more than 2 weeks of this. The day before scheduled delivery at the 10 day mark some dumb dumb calls to say he doesn't have her dishwasher in stock now someone must have sold it and says they'll deliver when back in stock...with no eta. He has what sounds like a big rub in and is hardly intelligible. My mom calls crying because she doesn't know what to do. I spend 7 hours over 3 more days trying to get ahold of someone to tell me what's going on. Picture this I'm calling on a cellphone and a laptop separately to the 800 number and local stores each day until I can't wait anymore. Mind you not a single person ever answers the phone in that time. I schedule callbacks that route me back to the holding queue when I answer them and start me over. My mom finally gets upset and breaks her effing quarantine to go INTO the store to get an answer.. remember she is old. They give her the same run around until she picks a new one out there and they tape her name on the box. They schedule delivery for more than a week later again. This started mid November and we're less than 2 weeks from Xmas. The day before delivery they call to say they can't find her dishwasher. She assured them her name is on the box andshe walks him by phone to the place in the back where her dishwasher is sitting with the name taped to it. This time they delivered it. This is the worst experience I've ever had anywhere. Please do not get yourself into this read these other reviews. It happens frequently. Had we any other options for her we would've switched but she lives in a rural area outside Myrtle Beach. Unless you have hours and weeks to spend working for Lowes yourself no cost could cover what you'll spend in time with these guys.",0,1

Also, the survey Lowes offers when you call is a joke. If the Rep thinks you are going to give a bad review, they simply do not hang up the phone on their side. The pause will eventfully time out. Pretty sad really.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Robbed,"I purchased a Gift Card for $300 for my Son & Daughter in law for a house warming gift for there new house so they could do some things around the house and they went to Lowe’s a couple of months later and went to use it and the cashier told them that it did not have any money on the card so we contacted Lowe’s card services and was told that someone would contact us back well never did so we called again and again and it was not till Oct. when we finally got someone to listen(we first contacted in June) after talking to a lady she took my Daughter in laws info and said would respond in email,got email next day saying that someone used the card online to purchase something but could not tell us at what store the purchase was made or where it was shipped but the lady who sent us the email fromLowe’s card services sent another e mail saying that allow 14 days and another card would be sent out and we waited another month and 3 more phone calls and still no replacement card the number for the card had to be taken by an Lowe’s associate cause that’s the only person who had the card at the time I paid for it so finally in Dec. got a hold of someone in card services and I was told that the case was closed and I had to call the local police to have them investigate that is was not there responsibility well they just lost some customers for good it’s like they didn’t even care pretty much I feel like I just gave them $300 and got nothing in return just like being robbed .",0,1

I prefer to shop at Lowes as the lighting is better and things are easier to find than at Home Depot but both are within a 5 minute drive so if this to be the new policy I will shop at Home Depot, or as my grandchildren call it the orange Lowes, from now on.The young lady checking me out was very nice and thanked me for my military service but when the manager was called over she was abrupt did not offer any options so I went to Home Depot and bought what I needed.I expect my wife will eventually use the credit ""we"" have but that will be the end of it.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,LOWES FREE DELIVERY USING XPO IS BAD,"I will preface this review with this statement, I don't review business because you only provide a bad review because you can reach a solution with the company. For the most part LOWES provides low prices on items but there is a price to pay for FREE DELIVERY. LOWES has contracted its FREE Delivery Service to a contractor call XPO Logistics and they SUCK so LOWES is to blame for this. When you pay $1800 for a washer and dryer there is deliver built into that price so its not free you just pay upfront. This is not a LOWES employee issue but the the contract delivery service that LOWES uses needs drastic improvement. The local LOWES'S rep/sales person was great and I have no problems with him! After that purchase, delivery was set for 12/31/20 between the hours of 8:30 AM to 12:00 Noon and install is handed off to ""XPO"" Logistics!?!? or what ever they call themselves now. XPO NEVER CALLED ME WHEN MY DELIVERY WAS GOING TO BE MADE OR THAT THE DELIVERY WAS DELAYED."" I had to call LOWES and inquire about the delivery and their status was it was ""on the truck for delivery"" so we waited until 8:30 PM still with no call from the delivery company. So it turns out the problem of poor service by XPO is not over, IT IS THE CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBILITY TO CALL LOWES TO RESCHEDULE THE DELIVERY EVEN THOUGH YOU WAITED ALL DAY AND WASTED YOUR TIME ON FREE DELIVERY! You would think that at a minimum level of customer service should provide a rescheduling without customer interaction. What further disturbs me XPO call center is in the Philippines which LOWES by contracting with XOP Logistics is outsourcing American Jobs. LOWES has some copiability at a corporate level to observe the performance of their vendors through customer service surveys. What I think happened is LOWES trying to remain completive they sacrificed quality of service for price. Almost everything you purchase in LOWES is made overseas. I would suggest using a local appliance store and paying a little more and get what you want coupled with customer service that makes since to support your local economy and American Jobs.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Delivery nightmare,"Scheduled delivery was 12/31 from 8-12 in the AM.Get a call 10 minutes prior to delivery guys arriving. Old refrigerator was taken down to the garage. Delivery guy (Mario) mentions that new refrigerator won't fit up the stairs. Seems to me that he's being lazy and doesn't want to take doors off so it will fit.I ask that we at least take the doors and see if it will fit because measurements suggest it will fit. He tells me that his supervisor will be by the property in a few minutes to determine whether not the appliance will fit. Delivery drivers leave, a couple hours later - still no ""supervisor"" and of course Mario isn't answering the phone. So now I have two refrigerators sitting in the garage. Call XPO they tell me it's a Lowe's issue. Unbelievable",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Broken dryer...still,"I have been without a dryer since 12/4. Service was to arrive 12/10, unfortunately the service company said they came but nobody was home. 3 people were home and nobody from service visited. After Lowes telling me it's a service company issue, I rescheduled for 5 days later. They came out and said 3 parts had to be ordered. When I was told parts were out of stock, I called lowes and the rep said they would get authorization to source parts other than normal channels. Today I found out this was not completed! I also found I can order OEM parts on Amazon and have them by Jan. 2. I was also told 2 of the 3 parts are not failed but may in the future. I am without a dryer for a month because the service company is trumping up a bigger bill, service men have lied about a home visit, lowes rep didn't follow up on sourcing parts and an overall collective incompetence and lack of customer service. This is not acceptable and I want to warn people to avoid a hideous ecperiance by purchaseing anywhere other than Lowes! I am certain to be contacted by Lowes early January and may get scheduled and perhaps have may appliance repair completed more than 2 months after scheduled repair. Oh and I have the extended warranty too. It means nothing...lowes blames service..I paid Lowes my money and if they source the work to a crappy low bid, then they take the heat!",0,1

Eventually I had to go inside to pickup my order.Lowe's needs some major operational help as this clearly is not limited to individual stores.

As I already had been told the previous twenty-four hours was the time a General manager would call, I called again to ask why and see if a district manager could be involved. This time customer care told me I would not be called for 72 hours.

Saul at Colonie Center Lowes could not have been sweeter. He listened patiently to the story and said "" That's not the kind of story I like to hear ."" He said I want to get a stove out to you today."" I almost dropped to the floor after everything I had been through, this was what I had been trying to have happened all week! He called me back and said, ""there were no more Samsungs available, would I like a floor model from a different store, which he could not guarantee the damage or another model from his store.""I thought where was he all week, he could not have been sweeter.""I asked if he could send me pictures of comparable models to show my daughter"" He said sure!"" He said he was leaving soon, but he would have his assistant Les finish up with me. He said he would stand by his cell phone and have Les call me if I needed him! The new stove arrived around 4.30 p,m. and is actually better than the one I had as it has an air fryer too! So for this review, I gave them 4 instead of 1.

Lowe's Companies,Not happy with on line shipping !,"I ordered a mini refrigerator on line. At the time I placed the order, December 13th, I was given a delivery date of 12/21/20. Today is 12/23/20 and I have not received my shipment yet. I called the 800 number to track my order. I was informed that it was shipped on the 13th from California and it can take up to 14 days from day shipped. I was told to call back by January 4th if it wasn't recieved. This has caused a great inconvenience as I have guest coming to my home on the 26th. I thought I was allowing a few days for any delay but I surly did not expect 17days!!

Lowe's Companies,Lowes has been a huge disappointment in…,"Lowes has been a huge disappointment in the last 4 weeks. I ordered a 24x24 light panel 4 weeks ago. My item was lost. (Not their fault)So, I ordered the same panel and they shipped it again. The panel arrived, and behold it was the wrong size and BROKEN. I called to have the correct size panel shipped to me and they told me I had to repay the price I initially paid for the panel before they would send me a third one. So, I did not yet have the correct unbroken panel, yet I was supposed to pay for it again. When I returned the panel to the store, I was directed to lighting to order the correct panel. However, after pushing the assistance button they have on the wall, I waited for 20 MINUTES. Guess what, nobody showed up! I will not be shopping at Lowes. Their customer service is attrocious, and no one seems to know what is going on when you ask for help. If I could rate a zero I would.",0,1

They stole $70 dollars from me after my company graciously gave me a $100 gift card for Christmas. The lady that checked us out told us there was only $30. I should have known to double check but she insisted it was only for $30. Then it took her 10 min to take off the shop vac we tried to get of the machine. She didn’t even know how to do the job and had to have a manager. People keep warning me about going there and now I’m listening.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes Online Ordering is Terrible,"If I had the option, I would give Lowes 0 stars. I ordered a Bosch appliance package with Lowes back in October. Even though their prices were a little higher, I used Lowes because I was promised a November 20th delivery. I received an email that my order was going to be received the week of November 20th, so I gave away my old appliances. The day before the delivery, I received another emaI stating the date was moved to December 11th. Needless to say, today is December 22nd, and I still have no appliances. I tried calling several times to speak to someone who supervises online ordering, but I never heard back from anyone connected with this ineffective system. I finally received a call from a local store who's manager agreed that there are so many screw ups and the local stores( who have nothing to do with the system) are assigned to speak to the unhappy customers. I had no appliances for Thanksgiving and now it will be the same for Christmas. I have cancelled my order with Lowes and would never use them again. They even screwed up my refund! Very poor customer service. Use a local appliance store. Thanks to ABC Appliances in Pennsauken, NJ, I will soon have new appliances.",0,1

I then called Lowes Woodbrige, NJ (supplying the oven) whose manager is Rich who explained I need to call Logistics. This continues for over a week. I took two days off of work as they said I would be receiving it that day and then never did-- never received a call informing they had cancelled my order. I finally receive it on 12/18.

The order isn’t even ready. I called corporate and left a message for them to call me back, after 50 mins still waiting I finally get a call from corporate, I tell her my story and that I’m still waiting.

I went home and got the other cabinets I had picked up from them and returned them back. Took my business to Home Depot. I deleted their app and would never recommend this store to anyone.

At the store, using cellphone data, I tried to display the cart. For over half an hour I was unable to get lowes.com to display my cart. Then it suddenly showed zero items. No one was around for help. I asked a nearby man for help. They couldn't find anyone and came back instead. But were hostile. Said they couldn't help me, if I wouldn't tell them what I wanted, but I told them exactly what I wanted. They slunk away. I asked if they were coming back. They disappeared. A friendly woman at the customer service desk found the items on her terminal. They got a man to show the items to me. However, that guy acted as though I was holding him up. This has happened too many times in Lowes, though it's been awhile. No place to complain online. I'll try Home Depot first next time, though it is further away.

Lowe's Companies,Do They Hate Customers?,"I just drove 30 miles (one way) to shop at Lowes. I do this, because I’ve always preferred Lowes over the “main competitor”, even though it’s just a few miles away. That may have changed today when I stood at the paint department counter for 20 minutes as the lazy employee ignored me (I was the only customer). Needless to say, I just left my basket full of project material and walked out. The people behind the customer service counter (which is directly across from the paint department), watched the entire time as I received no service and not one person spoke up or asked if they could help. If this is the standard of service that Lowe's has stooped to, maybe I do need to shop elsewhere. To be honest, they may have well of asked me to leave since that’s what it felt like. I’m so annoyed, I may not to even purchase online from them anymore, and Lowe's has always been my “go-to” for anything home related, including appliances.

Lowe's Companies,Worst experience ever for Lowe’s service warranty,I have had the worst experience ever with the Lowe’s warranty i purchased with the Samsung washer. I have waited a month with four service calls and still don’t have my washer fixed. Every time I call there is an excuse and another week’s time for another service call. This is the worst experience and I will never buy another appliance there again. I have purchase many there before and always bought the warranty. But this is a joke. You pay money for a service and are treated so poorly. I have asthma and a compromised immune system so a laundry mat is out of the question. Do they care? Absolutely not. Just unbelievable.

I have to take the dryer one night and come back the next day for the washer. I come back for the washer and Affirm tell me the are charging me for another washer. The original total was $1550.18 they tried to capture $2325.24 which is the exact amount of another washer on top of the original washer and dryer. This amount was quickly declined because it's over the ordinal amount I requested from Affirm. They tried to say the extra more was some finance charge. I called Affirm and they explained what this issue was however, the manager on duty was unable to do anything. I had to have a washer so I ended up buying another washer so my family could do laundry. They have offered no help to resolve this matter and have only made excuse. I will be returning everything and buying some place else. This could have all been avoided if I took both pieces home the first night but the work would not help me put the dryer on the van roof.

Lowe's Companies,"Kitchen project, thumbs down","While the staff at Lowe's were friendly and seemed to want to be helpful, there was such a lack of communication the entire project was a mess and I am not happy with the part of the project that Lowe's was responsible for. We first visited the store in July, we choose the countertops and butcher block and paid for everything - $3,000+ in August. I asked for a deep farmhouse sink, which they said could not be done. I then asked for a deep, single bowl, white sink. They ordered a standard, double bowl stainless steel sink. I ended up having to go buy the sink I wanted somewhere else, paying for 2 sinks. In October, we still had not heard anything about the work being scheduled, so I called. To be fair, our timeline was to have everything completed by Thanksgiving, but I had not heard ANYTHING, so was calling for info. At that time we were told our old counters would be removed on October 8. They were removed, leaving us with no counters and no sink. They said it would take 2 weeks for new ones, which was expected. The countertop company measured and said we needed to level the cabinets. It was in our contract that Lowe's would do this, but getting them back out before installation was a nightmare. The countertops were scheduled for the 24th, on the 22nd they still had not come out. Someone came late on the 23rd, spent 20 minutes here, charged another $300. On the 24th the countertop company came and installed the lovely new countertops, but they had to level the cabinets in 4 different places. Lowe's was supposed to install the butcher block and hook-up the sink once the counters were done. It took more than a week for them to come back - apparently the contractor went to Florida. They told me I was scheduled until November to explain the delay. But if that was the case, why did they come in October and rip everything out??? The butcher block top is not the color or wood that I asked for and cannot be stained, so I am stuck with it, though Lowe's did say they would sell me another type of wood. After this experience I will never do business with Lowe's again. Everyone is friendly, but no one seems to have any idea what they are doing and there is no communication between the employees, the contractors, and the customers. This is not my first kitchen re-do and it may not be my last, but it will be the last time I work with Lowe's.",0,1

We called to find out the time of delivery and she showed nothing in the computer for the replacement she had promised and was a bit rude about it. We got another manager over her and he sent us another stove. Well it was also damaged, and our new refridgerator has a bad solenolid so it does not make ice or allow water to come through. We called yet again to report the dented stove and refridgerator issue and they said they would call back. 2 days later still no call so i went into the store personally and again told ""a manager will call you"".

Neither happened!Had to call off work again and wait for it to arrive. AND NOW I have been charged twice for the washer and was told it could take weeks to get it off of my card. Lastly, no discount of any kind for the inconvenience. This doesn't even include the order I had the week before that was messed up from the Wilmington store. Called off work a total of 5 times!

Customer Care collected our information but could not find the vacuum. They promised to call us back. That didn't happen either. Called on the 16th to talk with a manager.

I opened for that, nope, no call back, no way to talk with anyone. tried the McKinney store one more time. Customer Care (really?) see your order do not know where your vacuum is.

Got our measurement and quote 2 days later, ordered the carpet- it came within 7-10 days. We were told that the installers would be calling us to get a date for the install. We knew a guy in our community and he offered to install it so we picked up the carpet. This is when it started to go wrong. We told the flooring guy we would be there around 5-6 pm to pick it up but it was 7:30pm before we left. They didn't have it ready. The next day the carpet man that we hired- started installing and he said that we didn't have enough padding. So we called Lowes again and they said that they shorted us 2 rolls and 14 ft of padding. We went to pick it up and they had it ready!! yay. We talked to the manager and he said that we would get refunded for not having the company install-$300 we got back and when I told him that we had to make a second trip- the manager lied because he said that we weren't quoted for that- but we were because the lady told us exactly how much we were shorted. In the long run- the install company called us the day after we picked up carpet- and said that they were 4 weeks out/ and chances are I hope they are making more than $300 off of installing because the guy we hired put in around 20 hours of time.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,"""Blows"" rhymes with Lowes","All I can say is the word ""Blows"" rhymes with Lowes. Cuz Lowes Blows. It appears to be the same regardless of which store you are in as well. They don't really honor your military discount. I have so many complaints that I won't bother listing them. All I can say is Home Depot will get my business from now on. Even the woman (Lowe's employee) at my last checkout stand told me she shops at Home Depot because the customer service at Lowes is so horrible. That speaks volumes!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I wish I could give this review…,"I wish I could give this review negative stars. This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST STORE IN THE HISTORY OF STORES. I have visited Lowes for the last time. The last 5 times everyone working in that store was completely useless, and I left all 5 times without getting anything,(with the exceptionof the last visit). I only went there as a last resort, as the tree farm I usually go to was closed this year and I live in a small town with few options. I am concmvinced they train their employees to be as useless as possible so customers give up and (they hope) just buy something anyway. The final straw was a Christmas tree I bought a wee ago. Their garden center had no one working in it, and I didn't want to drag a tree through the entire store [from outside], and I couldn't find anyone to assist me so I took the tag off and went inside to wait in line. There was only 1 cashier, but I saw literally 11 different workers pass by, see the enormous line if over 30 people and walk on by. One worker tried to look busy by pushing a cart around with a single pack if batteries (triple A). When I got to the register the cashier wanted to know where the tree that was supposed to go with my tag was. I was loising my patience by this point, and told her if she wanted to see the tree she could come outside and look in the back of my truck. Adding maybe they should have someone working out there.. she eventually wrang me up after some guff.. meanwhile it is 6 days later and they sold me a completely DEAD TREE. It never drank water, and my ornaments are falling off because the branches are dead. There are more needles on the floor than on the tree, I wish I was allowed to attach a photo, as the severity of the sub-par quality of this tree needs to be seen in order to fully grasp just how crappy this merchandise is. I am not a complainer, but I feel this amount of utter incompetence needs to be logged so others avoid this store like the plague. I HATE LOWES.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Save your time and money never shop at Lowe’s.,"If there are a less than one star to be given I will give it, unfortunately there isn’t.

The delivery personal called me on time, but they told me they only have the washer and nothing else I told them to cancel the delivery until I get everything at the same time. Tried to call the store got no help, went in the store talked to an assistant manager assure me that my complete delivery will be the the next day. I had to make an adjustment to my work schedule at wait for it, and they showed up to my house again with only the washer. Went to the store again talked to the same person, told me that the reason why they haven’t delivered my complete order because the dryer was damaged and the have another one coming in the store and it will be delivered to me in 2days. I’ve asked him why the haven’t talked to me and communicated the info he told me he didn’t know the situation???? Waited for couple of days to get the delivery with another adjustment to my schedule, and the result was it will not be delivered to me on time. I have canceled my expensive purchase with them and I found a cheaper same washer and dryer somewhere else with a better delivery service and closer date.

Lowe's Companies,I am placing a complaint in regards to…,"I am placing a complaint in regards to Lowes descriminatory practices. This incident is not random, but rather commom practice at this location. I have decided to keep a detailed journal about the many events I have either witnessed there. Today incident took place with a cashier named, Dustin (white male, wearing a veteran batch) at 16:50, Saturday, December 12, 2020 at Lowe’s, branch located at 1795 South Robert Street, Saint Paul, MN. I was standing in line carrying a plant. There was a long line there. They finally decided to open another check out lane. Typically, in a company where employees are properly trained and leave their biases at home. The next person waiting in line is asked to come to the recently open check out lane, instead, this employee, Dustin, walked to the lane and asked the person right behind me to come to the new check out lane. I was left standing there carrying a plant, but apparently invisible to the white cashier. I reached out see that cashier’s name tag for my records. I called that incident out and the cashier didn’t even bother to apologize. The racism displayed by this employee and others at that branch is unbearable, but I am taking the time to write this review because fair treatment should matter to corporations. I hope you take action. This branch is located in a very racially diverse area, and yet people of color at this branch continue to be treated this way. You shoukd take matters like these seriously.

I handed her my check for $19 which was my card balance in full. She looked at it and told me she needed my drivers license. Mind you I am paying my bill, not making a purchase. I asked why she needed my license and she said for my protection. I asked her what they were protecting me from other than some crook coming in and paying my bill? No response. Then she asked for my phone number and after fiddling around for a few minutes she walked away and came back with a supervisor who asked me to change the date on the check since I had written it the day before. All of this to pay the $19 I owed on my charge account. I left without the purchase I went there for to begin with.

They do not often provide estimated delivery dates, and when they do, get ready for that day to come and go with no items in sight. I've spoken to 3 customer support representatives about my items and all 3 were incompetent, claiming they didn't have the knowledge to assist me with where my items might be. I already PAID for these items. I should receive them promptly! A ridiculous business model. I plan to order all similar products form Amazon from here on.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Installation rip off,"My issue is not with the Fountain Lowe's employees. Everyone with whom I interacted was very helpful, friendly, and professional. The issue I have is with the installation company for my hot water heater and with ""corporate Lowes"". I was charged an ""unusual access fee"" of $197 because the hot water heater needed to be installed in an outdoor closet area that is 2 feet above the ground. I spoke with Corey with the Lowes installation department and he said he also felt the charge was too high. However, when he spoke with ""corporate Lowes"" they said they thought the charge was justified. It was my impression that the extra cost was for additional labor, however, only one employee of the plumbing company completed the install. So, not only was the unusal access fee exorbitant, but also there was nothing extra required for the install. I would ask that I be refunded the $197 since the plumbing company charged the extra fee without having any extra labor provided. This is the type of issue that will cause me to go to other companies such as Home Depot for similar services in the future. If Lowes cannot maintain some cost control over their install companies and if corporate Lowes stands behind extra fees for no extra service, it makes me question what other areas are Lowes taking advantage of customers.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Don't go to Lowe's for carpet installation--or for anything.,"We did carpet installation services through Lowe's. We had planned to change the carpet of the entire second floor and also our stairs. When Lowe's gave us times and dates for when the services would be completed, we rearranged our very busy schedules to accommodate and to ensure a smooth process on our part. HOWEVER, the Lowe's carpet teams did the following:1. Didn't even show up. Multiple times. Claimed that their crew didn't show up and, therefore, they couldn't do the carpet (this happened multiple times over 3-4 weeks)2. Showed up late. Didn't even bother to inform us. We were not prepared to have to deal with carpet installation amidst our work schedules (which we had changed to accommodate the original installation time)3. Didn't order enough carpet. When they finally got their lives together, they stripped the entire floor and stairs to install carpet only to realize they didn't have enough carpet to cover the stairs. It has been weeks. We still don't have carpet on our stairs. On top of ALL of this, they told us a date and time on which they would complete the stairs carpet installation. Then, we received ANOTHER call that they didn't have their crew because they just ""didn't show up."" My poor dad had to go to Lowe's to ask why it has been weeks without carpet and they still couldn't manage to show up when they said they would?? Then, the manager had the AUDACITY to tell MY father that he was being disrespectful for asking why the carpet installation was delayed, why the carpet wasn't ordered, and why the crew didn't show up in the midst of a global pandemic. As much as we take this pandemic seriously, it does not give Lowe's the proper justification to order the wrong amount of carpet or let any of this happen for so long. It also doesn't give Lowe's the right to be so unbelievably disrespectful and accusatory when the evidence of this situation clearly shows that this is all because they are lacking in basic courtesy, customer service, and, well, everything.

Then when we finally got our fridge, the delivery man kept telling me that it wasn’t his job to do anything expect drop the fridge off. Even though they claim “expert installation.” And to top it all off, he was a sexist, misogynistic jerk. He kept telling me only my husband would understand and be able to do everything. I was trying to ask him questions so I could basically do his job for him, but according to him, I guess women are too frail and stupid to understand anything.

I have to pass a Home Depot to go to the local Lowe’s and the way this stupid $14 order has been handled is going to cost you 1000s. No one will take ownership and figure out a way to make sure I am satisfied. If I could give a 1/4 star I would. I have call the 1-800 my local Lowe’s and either no one will take ownership and figure out away to get me the information or get the stupid $14 purchase to me. Ridiculous,0,1

And when we went to complain to Mrs. Carmen that she was the one who sold us the kitchen, she didn't care.my advice: better buy kitchen elsewhere so you do not regret it and lose your money and illusion of a beautiful kitchen.Everything was in Lowe’s of Yonkers ny .

It literally took two hours and two trips to different stores to get 18 pieces of tile... mind you that the stock on the tile I needed reported plenty on hand if you are to believe the app .. ( I mean why have it if it’s way way off?) on the veterans rd location in SI. Staff simply didn’t want to look so sent me to another location in forest ave. After two trips to customer service desk trying to get help & 45 minutes later I had to start shouting for assistance... mind you there were constant announcements for customer service to many different aisles to help other customers but I could not get any. Finally after creating a disturbance I got someone to find my tile on the floor in a box pushed way in. I know there is pandemic but from the level of disengagement ... staff simply doesn’t care. I hate to think it’s because my ethnicity is different than most staff is why I was treated so badly but it’s the only answer as to why other customers seemed to get help & I was given a run around & told to go find assistance from customer service desk!,0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Lowe’s located in Gaithersburg, Md","The Lowe’s store located on Market St, Gaithersburg, Md must be the worst, even if they aren’t trying. I called the store’s customer service at 11:27am on Fri, Dec 4, 2020, to cancel an order. The first time I called, I got to hear Christmas songs for 3 mins. before hanging up. The second time, got this guy, who answered the phone with “customer service”, no name or store information. I asked if this was Lowe’s, and he completely disregarded me, repeating “customer service” as if annoyed. I told him I needed to cancel an order and he replied with “you can do that in the App” and hung the phone up. Really? This is his job: “servicing customers”. I called back hoping to get this AH on the line again to give him a piece of my mind and, of course, he didn’t answer. Got Rose instead, and so, after explaining my issue with customer service, I asked her to tranfer me to the store manager. She took the message, saying that “he”, the manager, would be returning my call as soon as he was done with a call. Never received the call. Instead, three hours later I called back. Rose answered again and transfered me again to the manager, but after a long string of ring tones followed by more Christmas music, I gave up. No wonder Lowe’s in Gaithersburg is in such a decrepit state. I’ll stick with Home Depot since they’ve shown they have more respect for customers.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I had a terrible experience purchasing a dishwasher,"I had a terrible experience purchasing a dishwasher at Lowes in Wareham, MA. The dishwasher arrived on November 23 in a packing crate, and when my plumber went to install it, the tub was crushed inside and unable to be used. My experience with the delivery was also horrible. A man put the dishwasher on his shoulder from the truck, and carried it that way into my house. No paperwork to sign, no opening the delivery crate to see it if was damaged, nothing. He ran out of my house as fast as he could. This was the week of Thanksgiving. On that day, November 23, , I called Lowes in Wareham and spoke to the Delivery Manager (who did not give me his name) who told me that this is the way that dishwashers are delivered from Lowes. He said that they are never taken out of the crate. He had attitude, and ended the call with ""So what do you want me to do? I can't do anything about it, it is the delivery company's problem. The day before Thanksgiving, November 25, I called the store and asked to talk to a manager. He told me that dishwashers are not delivered like that, and it should have been uncrated and I should have been asked to sign a paper saying it was delivered in good condition. He set up the delivery company to come November 27, the day after Thanksgiving to pick it up. I asked about refunding my credit card, and he told me that he could not do that until the dishwasher had been received back in their store. He promised that it would be back by Saturday, November 28, and he would issue the refund on that day. I waited over the weekend, and a few days more, and called my credit card company. By Tuesday, December 1, no refund had been issued. Today is Friday, December 4. It was not refunded. I called Lowes this morning to confirm that my credit card had been refunded. I spoke to the Receiving Manager. She told me that no refund had been initiated, and it was a special case, requiring 2 managers to sign off on the refund. I asked her if she could sign off, as Bob had told me that he would start the refund. She told me that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE had approved the refund on my credit card. I asked her to sign off on it, and for her to find another manager to meet the company's 2-manager approval mandate for this ""special"" refund. She told me that she would, and took my email to send me a copy of the receipt of refund. I did not expect much, and was getting ready to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. But to her credit, I received the refund receipt within a couple of hours. Suffice to say I will never shop in Lowes again. I was lied to by managers, and was delivered a damaged dishwasher that my plumber told me had to be dropped from quite a height to cause so much internal damage to the tub - it was impossible to close the door. I will never shop there again, and I am very upset.And the extended warranty that I purchased for $100. was not refunded. I suppose that I will be battling with the company that provides that service as well. I am fed up.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Does Not Care About Its Customers,"I placed an order for an item with Lowe's on 10/28/20 in which a Lowe's corporate customer service employee ""completed"" the order for me. I had to do a split payment using a $100 Visa gift card and my actual credit card, so I could not make the order on the Lowe's website.I was originally scheduled to pick up my item at Lowe's # 0535 in Oklahoma City on 11/5/2020. A couple days later I received a notification that my order was delayed and there was no estimated delivery date at the time. I waited a week and had still not received an update, so I reached out to Lowe's customer service who was unable to provide any details on the order for me at the time and had a store employee follow up with me.On 11/20/20 a Lowe's store employee called me and still had no update on my order, but stated they were receiving a shipment of the item the following day, and I could pick up the item then. Since I had already placed the order and given payment information, I was going to let Lowe's fill the order as the store should have filled the order when the items were received. On 11/24/20, I still had not received a notification that my order was processed, so I went up to the store to get the item and fulfill the order myself.When I tried to have Lowe's complete my order by bringing the item to the Customer Service desk, they confirmed that the initial Lowe's corporate employee who took the order down never actually completed the order so they had to cancel it. However, they cancelled the order before confirming the payment methods and stated the $100 went back on the Visa gift card, which I had gotten rid of as the balance was used in full, a Lowe's employee told me the order went through, and I received email confirmation that the order was placed successfully.Because I still needed the item the order was originally placed for, I bought the item with the full costs going to me as I was unable to use the gift card balance that Lowe's originally took from me.I spent hours on the phone with various Lowe's representatives trying to get the $100 reimbursed to me either through store credit or a Lowe's gift card. I have now been told that I must get in touch with Visa to try and have another card issued to me with the $100 since Lowe's issued the money back onto a Visa gift card.This issue was caused solely by Lowe's, starting with the customer service rep failing to complete my order and telling me the payments went through and the order was placed successfully. Additionally, the store failed to confirm how the order was paid for and should have confirmed where the refund should go for the $100 gift card that was used. Now because of these mistakes made by Lowe's, the store has taken $100 from me as well as providing extremely poor customer service from start to finish.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Pi***ed off customer,"I have been a member of Lowes for years now. And thru those years I have been happy with service. I usually shop at the Littleton NH. Store as it is the closest to me ,but with Covid 19 we are not suppose to go into NH without quarantine for 14 days. So. We were in need of a new snowblower and could not put it off any longer winter here.. So we went thru the Essex Vt store. But we ordered online to do the curb side pick-up. I ordered online and waiting for email to tell me when it would be ready for pick-up. 3-7 days... So on the 3rd day I received and email saying it was ready to be picked up. So off we went 1.5 hours later hegel there call and they tell me sorry its not here.. WHAT... I received an email saying it was ready for pickup. Nope not here. So we drive back 1.5 hours. Not at all happy. Very pi××××× to be correct.... The next morning I read the email again and it does say its ready to be pick-up so we call and can't get thru to customer service so we ask for someone in lawn and garden and we get Brittany. She looks it up and says yea it says its here. But she says she will go look for it and call us back. 20 min. Later she calls and says yep it's here come and get it... So off we go yet again 1.5 hours we get there call for curb side pick-up and they say sorry its not here.... What the hell..... seriously.?. Really pi×××× at this point. We tell them we had called and was assured it was here. So we ask for Brittany( the one who took the time to go look. ) and she says its here.... So if people took the time to look it would of saved us time and money from driving 6 flipping hours and 100 bucks in gas... if we did not NEED this snowblower we would of canceled the whole order. At this point. I am seriously thinking about never shopping at lowes again. But I will say you need more people like BRITTANY at the Essex store. Because if it wasn't for her you most definitely would of lost our business. Very pissed off customer..........",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowe’s Sucks...and I’m sad about it,"There's a long backstory here: But the short of it is my family had to make the difficult decision to sell our ""forever"" home, a home we all loved, and move in with my widowed mother. We took the equity we had in that house and ""fixed up"" my mama's house, at least as far as the money would go. One thing I knew I wanted to do was give my mama a new kitchen.The choice was clear as to where I would get my appliances. Lowes is the only choice we have in our small community. (I know we could have ordered from some online site, but we wanted a closer relationship with our supplier.So to Lowes we go. I sat with a Lowes ""cabinet specialist"" and we mapped out the area and made a plan for the cabinets. I ordered all our appliances on the same day.Cut to the chase.....NEARLY EVERYTHING WE GOT FROM LOWES HAS BEEN TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!At first I made attempts to communicate my frustrations, but finally was told that the ""Cabinet Man"" was no longer in their employ and that he didn't know what he was doing anyway! (Thanks for that!)Sadly, now I just make a mental note of all the things that are defective. I'll try to include pictures, but I am not too savvy on the computer.Let me list them for you:1. Immediately we noticed that the cabinets directly over the stove were turning yellow. The Lowes microwave has a vent that comes on automatically when we are cooking if there is any steam released. It is really loud, but we have accepted that. The ""Cabinet Specialist"" assured me the layout we chose would work. I did not know my off-white cabinets would be yellow within a very short time. Yes, it is grease build up. No, I cannot get it clean. Please believe me, I have tried everything. I have scoured the internet for suggestions and have done them all. If I scrub any more it looks to me that I will damage them. The way I see it now, there is no fix for this. SO VERY SAD.2. The cabinet under the sink (yep, that came from Lowes too) is in terrible shape. I thought I was getting wood cabinets. But if you look at that cabinet, the way it is warping under the sink, it looks to be something CHEAP3. The handle to the microwave just came off in my mother's hand one day as she opened the unit. I tried to superglue it back and it worked for a week or two. Now we just grab in from underneath. Not easy for my mother to do. Just another mental note of a defective part. Sad.4. The top silver decorative ""cap"" of the dishwasher popped off. Tried the super glue trick again. Same outcome. Another mental note, still sad. Speaking of the dishwasher, it started leaking 2 weeks ago. Back to internet. Lowes.com for manual. Followed all the suggestions. Cleaned the filter. Now it works....but only on one setting....the other 2 still leak. Oh well, expected that. Mental note. Still so sad. I really wish these things had not happened. I don't have the energy to go through all that needs to be corrected in this kitchen. I just think everyone should know that LOWES cabinets and appliances should not be your first choice if you can help it. Take my word for it. Sincerely,SAD LOWES CUSTOMER😟",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Mr.Bert and the moline il store 61265…,"Mr.Bert and the moline il store 61265 is an exceptional employee. He not only works hard during his shift he goes above and beyond off shift as well. As I was wondering the store lost out of my mind like a caged butterfly finally let go into the wild to spread its wings. I was about to give up on my whole $3,000 purchase after helplessly finding what I need Mr.Bert saved the day guided me directly where I was wanting to go and not only did he show me what I was looking for his insight and knowledge on the multitude of products is next to none. I will defiantly be coming back to Lowe’s after this experience. Mr.Bert is no doubt Future store manager material!!",0,5
Lowe's Companies,"Incompetence On Steroids - Store #1570, Houston, TX","We've been buying our appliances from Lowes for years, with no issues whatsoever. This incident more than negated the positive experiences. The episode involved some of the most inept and incompetent individuals in the history of retail sales.We selected our new refrigerator and arranged for a Saturday delivery.The confirming call came as always, and all was on schedule. Our neighbors' children wanted our old fridge, so we put all our food in coolers and said goodbye to the old reliable box. But Saturday came and went, with no delivery or call.We went to the store first thing Sunday and spoke with the manager on duty. He remarked that deliveries are handled by a contractor, and that Lowes had no control over its operations. Huh?? I didn't buy the refrigerator from them; I bought it from Lowes, and the responsibility lies with the merchant. He called the delivery people, and was informed that the item had been returned to the warehouse ... no reason given. Further back-and forth between the three of us resulted in a promise to deliver the fridge Monday morning. Just to be on the safe side, I picked up some dry ice (for $52!) on the way home.Monday morning passed with no word from anyone. I called, and was advised that the delivery system had crashed, and that trucks were just then being loaded. The ETA was 4:30. By this time, there was no hope in saving any of the food, so out it went. With no word by 6:00 p.m., I again called, and was told that trucks are running late, but that we'd be receiving the delivery that evening. At about 7:45, the driver called to inform me that he'd be there in about a half-hour. Finally! But wait ... there's more!Nobody showed, even after the phone call. It is now Tuesday, and we doubled our efforts ... I went to the store and my wife called Corporate. I wanted to speak with the general manager, but there's apparently a layer of assistants who insulate her from customer contact. The result of all this was, (1) the refrigerator will ""200%"" be at our door the next day, and, (2) we will be compensated for our lost food and days of inconvenience. Terrific!! So we're now at Wednesday.The automatic call came, with delivery scheduled for 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. About 6:00, we called to obtain a more precise ETA, and were informed that the contractor was advised by Lowes that the item was out of stock, and that we wouldn't be receiving anything. Pause for Thanksgiving break (thankfully).Friday morning, it was back to the store, again attempting to speak with upper management, but the same assistant we first dealt with came by. He knew our situation well, and communicated it upstairs, like the old Telephone Game. Bottom line: Lowes made good, with a combination of store credit (presumably to be used on our new fridge) and a discount on any unit we buy. The nightmare ends ... not quite.We picked out our new refrigerator after looking and comparing models, and went to place the order, only to discover that it won't be available until January. At this point, we'd had it. We can use the credit, since we'll be doing some work at home ... no loss there. The discount turned out to be moot, as we'll be getting our new unit from Costco, where it's priced $200 below Lowes.I later had a conversation with an individual who knows the system. He remarked, ""I know I should look surprised, but ...."" I've since cancelled all orders on my Lowes card, and once the balance shows zero, it will go the way of our spoiled food.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Never again… Ever. I'm done.,"Every time I come here I get incredibly frustrated. Brick and mortar, or online, doesn't matter. This store just sucks.Their tools are absurdly overpriced, their materials are either out of stock, or in the wrong place, the website is an absolute mess of crap they don't even sell, and their gift cards are useless online. Why?! There is not only no option in the app at all to use a gift card, but attempting to purchase on the computer wasn't anymore helpful as they don't even allow to you split payments. So, if you've got more than one gift card, you're screwed. Apparently, they don't care because they've already got your money. What do they care if you ever spend it? Absolutely abysmal. Never again. Ever.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Brand new Refridge stops working within 5 weeks.,"I purchased a Refridge on Oct 18, 2020, with a 5 year extended insurance. It stopped working on 11/25/2020 and I lost of the food in the freezer and refridge. I have been pushed from person to person all day today. the earliest they can get a service person is Next week sometime. I was told I should be happy it is next week, some wait 2 weeks or more. I did call corporate office and was told, they were sorry. Nothing else can be done. If I have not heard back from someone on when the schedule date is by Next Friday, then I need to call back. I do not understand how a company this big, does not stand behind their appliances or can not get service when it breaks down, especially if within 5 weeks of the purchase. Now for the next week, I do not have a way to keep anything cold, unless I want to spend more money or pay to eat out. No satisfaction. It seems they have their money, so it is not a big thing to them.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,So it all started September 8th when…,"So it all started September 8th when went to Lowes store number 98, Katy Tx. I was told October 20th windows would be ready.

Lowe's Companies,Great Service,"For many reaons and for many years I have hated Lowes.. store after store was all the same EXCEPT for the store on Brice Rd in Columbus. Although it's not the best area of the city, they have always provided amazing service. I will never go to their orange competitor again, unless I'm really desperate. After HD delivered a damaged appliance and told me I had to wait ANOTHER WEEK to get another washer delivered and installed I told them to go pound sand. at 230pm Monday I online ordered a washer and had it delivered at 830am the next morning... same brand of appliance. only thing was I thought I requested and paid for install which I did not but the process of hooking it up was very simple so I encourage everyone to save that hard earned money and do washing machine installs yourself.. they are so easy. Just check for leaks and make sure it's level. Thanks to Lowes I can do laundry again 😁 and I love my new washer .",0,5

Maytag has repaired several times and we still have an inoperable dishwasher. Switch my defective dishwasher!!! Yet another delay to wait for another replacement part on a BRAND NEW dishwasher we've owned for a couple of months !!! Noooooooo !!! This is no longer acceptable, It has been inoperable for the same amount of time we've owned! No No !!!Now the dishwasher has a bad vent switch for the steam/humidity. F8/E4/E2.

They said, ""No it wasn't ready"", and ""That's weird"" that the email said it was but she would pick it now and it would be ready in 15 minutes when I got there. I got there and parked in the pickup spot. I called them, told them I was waiting outside in slot#1. The worker found my order and said, no, it was not picked yet, but we'll do it now and ""We'll bring it outside right away"". I made it clear I was in slot#1 and waiting outside. I waited 20 minutes and called again. They don't have enough staff on the phones and it went on ringing with no pickup and I had to try again 10 minutes later. I said I've been waiting outside for nearly a half hour and she said, ""Oh, you didn't tell us that... It must have been the other girl that talked to you. It's been sitting here for a half hour... We'll bring it out now"". I realize COVID makes this thing harder, but they've had half a year to figure this out. Other companies are doing a much better job.

Everywhere in the house, the carpet is getting loose. It needs stretching everywhere in the house. When I contacted Lowes, I was told the installation warranty was for one year. Since it's two years now, Lowes can’t do anything. Within two years the carpet has all kinds of wrinkles and getting loose everywhere. I will never go to Lowes for any major home improvement.

Well, I never got the receipt, and when I told the store manager this, they told me ""ole well"". This was not my fault and strictly the fault of Lowes. My wife showed them the transaction on our bank account but didn't matter. I WILL NEVER GO TO LOWES AGAIN, AND I WILL SPREAD THIS STORY TO ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS NOT TO USE THEM.

They had according to web site 4 in stock at that location. Left plenty of time to allow them to get it ready. Wife and son left to go over when I saw the pickup notification come in. My fault as I never thought they would just change the pickup location store up and do one 20 minutes FARTHER than the location we were planning on being at.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Home Improvement is dishonest.,"I bought windows from Lowe's Home Improvement on 8/31/2020. Their people had been trying to deliver for about three weeks nagging me. However the installer wouldn't be available until 11/7/2020. All arrangements had been made for that date, delivery and installation. Though the installer showed Lowe's did not. After being let down so many times prior by Lowe's I cancelled the entire order on 11/9/2020 one amount of $1974.31 and one for $9777.29. I received the $1974.31 the next day in earnest. However the $9777.29 is being held back purposely by Lowe's even though they issued me a receipt.The Rio Rancho store manager Stacy Culp told me last week that a large amount takes a couple days. Now this week she is telling me that a check will be overnighted. And after talking to her boss Walter Cordova who also assured me yesterday that it would be overnighted it was not. It's been three days now on overnighting. This is a large sum of money to me which is now affecting me financially. When I call their people at customer service you get placed on hold and after a long while your told that an ""incident"" has been sent to the store level where at the store level nothing is being done but telling me that a check will be overnighted they just don't tell you what night. I've contacted my bank's fraud department and they also agree that this is wrong and will do their due diligence to refund my funds.

I was in customer service for over 35 years as a property manager. So I love exceptional customer service. I had ordered a leaf blower on line from Home Depo.. It looked like a toy and had no power. It was a Dewalt so I was really disappointed. I went into Lowes to get a couple paint supplies so I decided to look for a blower. First I encountered Johnathan in the lawn dept. He was helping another customer but took the time to acknowledge (very rare anymore). He answered one simple question. ""Where are the Dewalt blowers"". He told me where they were so I went on my way. I approached Eian near the tools and he showed me what I had just ordered on line and explained it was a construction blower for sawdust not a leaf blower. He could have just went about his business but he told me about another blower and walked with me to that department. Since I didn't have a cart because I did not plan to buy a blower he carried the blower to the counter in front.Then I realized I could not get the things to my carwithout a cart. Eian went and got me a cart! It was late in the afternoon and I was tired but I left happyand smiling about these two young men. They will go far if they continue to give that kind of customer service. My motto was always...You the customer are the REASON I am here! Sales would go way up if people could just get some help.

Lowe's Companies,They couldn't have done worse if they tried,"I am very disappointed with Lowe’s completed indifference for their customers. Intentionally making it difficult for a customer to resolve a problem is annoying. Refusing to take any responsibility for that mistake when it costs the customer time and money is unacceptable. Stopping your customer from speaking with a manager or filing a complaint is disgusting.On September 1st I placed a large order for chain link fence materials. At the time of the order, I received confirmation for a delivery date of September 17th. After verifying the delivery date on their website using the order tracker, I arranged time off work for September 17th to receive materials and begin putting in the fence.September 16th (the day before delivery) I received an email the order would be delayed until October. No explanation, no details, and no phone call. I called the Lowe’s my order was listed to ship from (Oak Park Heights) to get an explanation of the delay and updated delivery details. I was told they didn’t have my order, didn’t know who was coordinating the order, and suggested calling a different location. This pattern continued with me calling multiple departments at 4 different locations before getting directed right back to where I started.I was finally able to speak to a manager at the Oak Park Heights location who stated the order could not be delivered because the store had not yet received all the materials. The manager could not comment on when my order might be delivered, would not comment on how this last-minute delay may have happened, and could not point me to anyone to help me further. I asked if there was a corporate contact for customer service I could speak with who may have better visibility between stores but he flat out refused, stating all customer contact is handled by the individual locations. However, he also admitted the individual locations had no visibility or control of transfers between stores.A single item (the gate for the chain link fence) was delivered September 17th by Lowe’s Maple Grove location.A few days later I received a call from a Lowe’s delivery coordinator to reschedule the delivery of my order. A delivery date of September 29th is offered, which I accepted and confirmed over the phone.The morning of September 29th, I called Lowe’s Oak Park Heights delivery department to confirm my order had arrived and would be delivered that afternoon. They confirm my order had come in and would be delivered by 3:00PM. Around noon, my order was delivered. Upon inspecting the delivery, I found 10 items were missing. When I called Lowe’s about the missing items, they stated this portion of my order was canceled by Lowe’s because they did not have them in stock. This cancellation was neither approved by me nor communicated to me until I called and asked why there were missing. At this point I asked where I could file a complaint and the representative flat out refused to answer. Compensation of any kind was refused, including waiving the shipping/delivery fees.In the end, I paid Lowe’s thousands of dollars for an important order which was delivered 12 days after the promised date with the remaining items being canceled without telling me. I lost a day of work, spent about 2 hours on the phone over multiple days straightening it out, and still ended up driving +20 miles to get the remaining items. I still paid the shipping/delivery fees in full, and no compensation of any kind was offered. I don’t usually write negative reviews, but this was too awful of an experience not to warn others about. This was hands down the worst experience I’ve ever had with any company.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I’d rate this 0 if I could,"I’d rate this 0 if I could. Lowe’s has always been bad with estimating shipping time but my most recent experience has blown the term “poor customer service” out of the water. I ordered two doors 3 weeks ago, with the estimated shipping date changing 4 times and no answers from customer service on why. Each time I’ve called they’ve either said they don’t know or they are in route (only to call 3 days later and a new rep tell me they haven’t shipped yet). My contractor is now giving us a hard time because we keep pushing them back with this delivery not being in. To this day (3 weeks now) I do not have the doors, but they were quick to take the $400 they cost out of my account already. I’d suggest for anyone who was a reliable source for their product to take their business elsewhere.",0,1

I bought Milgard Tuscany windows through Lowe's in May 2020 and the seals are already breaking. When I talked to Lowe's about getting a refund for the windows they informed that they have a return policy of 90 days which was not communicated to me. If they had, I would have replaced them over the hot summer versus telling the Sales rep that I wanted to wait to replace them in the Fall after it cools down and was told it would not be problem. Well, its a problem now if I want a refund, then I have to pay a 20% restocking fee and the installation cost is not refunded either. Terrible service from Lowe's and bad communication at the expense of their customer. They don't care, they got paid and received their commission.Go to Pella and pay more for wood windows. Vinyl windows are cheap plastic.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Nightmare at Lowe's,"I wanted to order two bi-fold doors from Lowe's. It should be easy, right? No. It has been a nightmare. First, there is no one in the Millwork section to show doors to customers or to help with orders. I tried ordering on-line only to be sent to the store anyway. A store rep made an appointment with me to order the door and arrange for installation. She didn't show up for work that day. After many discussions with people in the store and a manager who wouldn't provide her last name, I placed the order. Then, the next nightmare! The installation company lied and said it had contact me to arrange for installation. Never heard from them. When I called them, they said there was no record of any installation and that Lowe's was probably trying to order the door. I called Lowe's and a person tried to work with the installation company. No luck. I'm exhausted by the many hours spent trying to buy two standard doors and get them installed. I will never, ever, ever arrange for Lowe's to install anything! Do yourself a favor and find a local company that can do the work for you. It will be far less stressful.",0,1

I called Lowes and explained the situation, they said she would have to return it to the store closest to her, I told them that this was a gift and to make the recipient have to return it wasn't something I was willing to ask. I asked to speak to a supervisor and after holding 10 minutes was hung up on. I called again and was put on hold another 15 minutes, and again told that my friend must return the cheap wreath before they could credit me with the $70.00.

A week later I had to phone them only to find out that my order was still on the order desk and they weren't sure when it would come in. I was offered the floor model washer that had a visible dent in the front of it for 25% off. I accepted that offer and drove 100 km into Sherwood Park to pick it up. The manager on duty wouldn't come to talk to me but relayed via staff that he'd only let it go for 10% off.

Lowe's Companies,Door Installation,"I have dealt with Lowe’s on numerous occasions in the past, all without any problems. This last experience was the worst I have ever had. They are not familiar with their policy of not drilling the door frame and door for an alarm system security switch. I was extremely clear on what I need and expected, especially since the existing door has the switch in it. After wasting my time with two different contractor visits, I find out it would be against Lowe’s policy to install the switch. After speaking with two Lowe’s managers, neither seemed to be concerned with the amount of my time wasted. It would appear that everyone associated with this project needs additional training on Lowe’s specific policies. Don't waste your time with Lowes.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Almost SIX Months for Refrigerator Delivery!!!,"We purchased a refrigerator on 6/1/2020 with an expected delivery date of 7/15/2020. It finally arrived on 11/13/2020. Worse than the time involved was the lack of correct information on the order. Each time we inquired at the local Lowe's, we were given a ""canned"" answer. ""It should be here within 2 weeks."" An honest ""we don't know"" would have been more appreciated. When contacting the national customer service office, the responses were more like they had really checked on the order. The problem was first the wait time to talk to someone and secondly, every answer conflicted with the response we were given in the previous inquiry. After the order was 3 months old, Lowe's customer service (nationally) had no record of an order with our purchase order number so there was no help there. Finally, one of the local delivery employees took an interest and for the last month, he would contact us every 10 days or so just to say it had not come but he hadn't forgotten about us. That was appreciated. We haven't had the refrigerator a week yet so we can't speak to our satisfaction, but it did come with positive reviews so we hope our problems with the purchase are behind us.",0,2

We received the text about the deliver and never received it. Today is 11/17 and we still have no fridge after being up at Lowes for over an hour trying to straighten it out. They said our fridge was being ordered and wouldn't be here til January. We had to pick out a different fridge and was guaranteed for it to be there the next day. That didn't happen either.

To top it all off the truck ran over a snowplow stake and messed up his lawn. When asked about the incident the Lowes employee told him “the driver was the worst at driving a truck”.

Was told we had to pay advance, which we did on August 8. A few days before October 30, was told there were delays and was now scheduled for November 30. Lowes now had our money for almost 3 months, with now anticipated for 4 months, with no assurances that it would start on November 30. Therefore, we decided to cancel the Sales Contract. Various employees at the local store, home office, ect. were contacted. No one would agree that we could to cancel the sales agreement. Some employees said they would call us back in 24 hours, they would not. They were call 3 times by us, left messages, no one would call back. Others, put on hold for 30 minutes, dropped call. One person said problem resolutions would only begin after the installation of the fence. Problem resolution department, they only took information. After 2-3 weeks, finally the local store person indicated that they we would receive a refund, but it had to be cash, it took too long to get a check from Corporate. Promised she would call back when she had enough cash. We agreed. Was called in 3 days and was told, if approved, we would receive a check from the Corporate office which would take 14 days. So therefore, after all this time, we still cant get a firm answer of when or if we are getting a refund.I had reservations about paying in advance for a service that had not been completed. I will never do it again. We have loss of confidence in Lowes to perform the service timely after the first delay.",0,1

Why wouldn't they have called me I had asked...When placing the order I told the man we no longer had the phone # in their system and gave him my cell phone #. Don't you think that if I called that morning, we would be home waiting regardless if they couldn't reach us. I called the store yesterday morning and they said our $800 order would not get onto the truck for the day but it would be out to us on Sunday...I made sure they had my phone # so they could confirm a time.

So does the installer throw the other 5' away and isn't that false advertising on your website which says $1.15 sf???

Lowe's Companies,Worst Experience Ever,"My husband and I are seniors. We live in a senior housing development. We went to Lowes to get a new dryer. We knew the specific size and told the salesman that we needed a flat back dryer. He said Lowes installs dryers all the time at our development and that we don't need a flatback.The company they use to install couldn't hook it up for some unknown reason. I had to hire a handyman and spent $70 to have him hook it up with no problem. However it didn't fit because it was not a flatback dryer.We went back to Lowes to return it and attempted to purchase a new one when they told us it would take 2 months. We can't be that long without a dryer. That's crazy and no way would we use a laundrymat due to covid. We just did the return process.No one told us that we had to unhook it from the wall ourselves because they don't come back into the house for a return pickup. My husband and I, who are seniors had to detach from the wall and lift it and put it in the room next to the door. Their customer service is beyond disgusting. The salesmen are no help at all. I tried calling the store and never got through. I called 10 different departments with no success. Finally I called the rental department and the woman couldn't find the order. I WILL NEVER USE LOWES AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THEM. Thd worst experience ever.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Absolutely horrible experience,"Absolutely horrible experience. We spent right around $5,000 buying everything we needed insulation, flooring, electrical, walls, paint and all the extra stuff with it. We ordered a ceiling fan and they sent us to 3 other location that said they had it and they didn’t. So when we got to the last location in San Marcos they of course didn’t have it but they offered to order it and so we ordered it the beginning of October and they said it would be here oct 27th and then the 29th. Guess what still not there and do now I call on 11/10/20 and they say ohh we’re discontinuing the item and they refuse to sell me the display after all the hassle and crap they we’ve gone thru to get it. I will not ever do business with them again I will pay the extra and go elsewhere if need be. Nothing but a bunch of run around with Lowe’s!!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Veteran Appreciation,"I'm a US Navy Veteran and would just like to say ""Thank You"" to Lowe's for showing such a strong appreciation towards service members.

Their new policy is if you purchase something with a Lowe's Giftcard, for refunds they will only give you a Merchandise card which is limited to IN-STORE purchases. Great to force people into your store during a pandemic. I'm sure their next step will be to issue Merchandise cards for any type of Refund. OUT OF CONTROL. DISAPPOINTED",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes violated terms of contract - discriminatory practices,"Our church ordered flooring for our parsonage and #loweslafayettein contracted with #ultimatehomeservices, who apparently discriminate against women pastors and Christians in general. They spent two days removing carpet from the home, then tried to double the labor cost for the job, and now we are two weeks out and unable to get resolution from either UHS or Lowes. This is quite disappointing; Lowes has violated the terms of their contract and is ultimately responsible for upholding what they quoted to us.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,We are only renting,"We are only renting, but our landlord had contracted Lowes for the flooring in the living area, kitchen, and bathrooms. Both were done but done late. We are still waiting for the carpeting to be installed in the bedrooms. This was put off 3 times. Well, today they were supposed to arrive to install between 1 and 3. It is 2:30 and so far nothing. We have moved everything out of the rooms and I am not moving it again. It's up to them to move things around as the landlord paid extra for this service. Lowes is terrible at installations. They don't seem to care as if they are the only ones around. Do not use Lowes for anything. Find a local business that cares about their customers.",0,1

I stopped shopping at that other ""Big Orange"" store because the last time I was there, an employee standing at the entrance literally shouted at me as I walked past and into the store -- and kept shouting as I walked away.

Lowe's Companies,Entry door fiasco!,"My husband and I live in Colorado Springs and wanted a new Pella entry door. Little did we know that it would take MONTHS to get our order straightened out. Our first experience in ordering the door was extremely frustrating and time-consuming due to the person we had to work with. We visited Lowe's multiple times to try and get everything correct. A lack of communication was the biggest problem as well as insufficient knowledge about doors. Sure enough, the door arrived at Lowe's, and it had the wrong type of glass in the sidelight. Being the persistent people we are, we asked to work with someone else. Nick C., became our sales specialist and he was terrific. He is knowledgeable, patient, kind, and communicates. I can't say enough good things about Nick. I would have given Lowe's five stars if we had been fortunate to work with him from the get-go. Nick is a Veteran and should be rewarded financially/and given a better position within the company. Lowe's is lucky to have him as an employee.",0,3
Lowe's Companies,Lowe's treats Veterans the best of any companies.,I work at a Lowe's and I have to say I am really impressed with how well Lowe's treats their Veterans and employees who are Veterans. This year Lowe's is letting associates stack their discounts from Nov 5th to Nov 18th. That means 20% off almost everything in the store. That is beyond amazing. Lowe's makes Amazon look really bad this year as Amazon decided NOT to give Veterans a discount on Amazon Prime like they did last year. Instead they offer it to anyone on Public Assistance. People who can't or Won't work. Yet not to Veterans who proudly served our country and put their lives on the line. How sad and pathetic is that of Amazon? Thank you Lowe's for honoring our Veterans!!!!!,0,5

So I went to the front of the store and asked for the manager. A woman who was standing near the entrance came forward and said she was one of the managers. So, I complained about why they let people come in not wearing masks. Her answer was that they cannot control that. Cannot control that? Menards which is a block away has a sign at the entrance and requires people to wear masks. Lowes does not care about the safety of its customers and worse they don't care about the safety of their employees. When I called their headquarters and complaned, I was told that they follow local city or county COVIT-19 rules which in this case is a republican county which does not care how many people catch the virus or die.",0,2

The next day we picked it up and unfortunately when we got it home and opened it, there was a deep scratch in it. Extremely disappointing! We got back in touch with the store manager and he asked what we were looking for and told us he would work with us to make things right. We went to the store to return the damaged one and he had checked his inventory and was able to show us other options. We found a different style that we liked and he discounted it for our trouble.

We started this process in August, it's now November and not only do we not live there anymore, the oven is yet to be installed. It started with the site survey, the tech came out surveyed what had to be done and that we would get a call to schedule the install. We got no call & 3 weeks later we had to go to the store to find out what was going on. They checked out the account, with the response, *I don't know why someone didn't call you."" Then they said we would get a call, we purchased the oven recommended & waited Another 3 weeks, meanwhile we sold our house, moved into our new home. We had to go back last week, the customer service rep was very helpful. He explained that everytime some clicked on our account it generated another PO. What I didn't appreciate was that after all this time waiting, I had to shell out another $400 for additional fees. We eventually got a schedule to install today 11/4, where they contacted us to say the oven has been damaged & they need to reorder & reschedule.

All of them told me that they are unable to cancel the order! Does that make sense to anyone????? I have to call FedEx and request they cancel the shipment? What?

Lowe's Companies,No one should be treated like this.,"I don't know where to begin. Last week I purchased a refrigerator from Lowe's. I asked the sales person if the men would move my old refrigerator into the garage when they came. He told me they would. When the men finally arrived they told me they would not guarantee they would not do a good job removing the doors and they were not liable for the refrigerator working when they put the doors back on. Not a good start. The men then suggested that they would put the new refrigerator in my garage and as soon as I got the other refrigerator moved they would come back and put the new one in. I said I didn't want the new refrigerator in the garage because I wasn't sure when they would come back. Now it gets good..... The supervisor gets on the phone and advises me to keep the new fridge in the garage because it would be safer there than in their warehouse!!! What? He further went on to say that he could not guarantee that the new fridge wouldn't get damaged if they took it back. I told them to take it back anyhow and if it came back damaged I would not take it. As they are getting it ready to put on the truck my neighbor said he could take off the doors of the old fridge right then. I told the men that the door matter was taken care of and they could put in the new fridge. Their response was, ""Lady, you used up your time. We have four other deliveries and now you will have to call and make another appointment."" I asked to talk to their supervisor Jessie, and he was very belligerent. He told me that they have no time for me, he didn't care what I said. At the same time one of the workers was also yelling at me telling me that they had to go. Needless to say I went to the store and told the manager that I was returning the refrigerator. No one should be treated like I was. I will never buy another appliance from them because of how I was treated.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes as a Company,"This is a review for how lowe's treats customers *generally*, rather than a specific *product* received.Over the years I have personally spent tens of thousands of dollars at Lowes. I have come to regret nearly every purchase.The most recent was for a Whirlpool refrigerator. The company promised delivery within a weeks time, and scheduled a specific date.The date came. The time of delivery approached and passed. I called into the store where I was informed both that the order had been scheduled for pick up in store AND that is was scheduled for delivery that day.As it turned out, they had screwed up. They had marked it for in-store pick up after confirming it was for delivery.That isn't _so_ bad, but what makes it infuriating is the customer service person. After asking about the problem, they informed me there was nothing they could do. I asked if they could tell me when it might be delivered. Their response was that it was in the system, and they would transfer me to appliances to find out more. I asked if I would receive reimbursement if they planned not to provide a refrigerator. They responded that they were customer service, and could not help with those sorts of matters, and would instead transfer me to appliances.In what world is customer service unable to help with reimbursement for a failed transaction? I bought a product - they promised delivery - they did not deliver - I have no product - they still transferred funds from my account.This is where a customer service person would initiate some sort of procedural reimbursement for not providing the product.No. Not at Lowes. At Lowes, they transfer you to appliances. Because Appliances knows more. About helping the customer.Why have a customer service? Why not just let me dial straight to appliances? Why take my in-store purchase, promise _delivery_, then decide not to deliver, then decide not to _confirm_ this with the customer, and then have this entire chain of responsibility be placed in Appliances?Lowe's is horribly mismanaged. If you are considering buying something at Lowe's - remember - don't. If you think they have something that you can use - they do not. If you think they have a product that you can easily pick up in store and then use, say a box of nails, just remember - they do not. It isn't worth doing business with them. They have neither the desire nor the ability to deliver on any agreement that they might make.Because delivering on promises is some _other_ guys responsibility. In Appliances.",0,1

Next day manager from Vernon Hills store calls me telling me it has to be returned to store.

Two weeks later the install team showed up ( one person) to remove carpet, level floor , install laminate, and base boards which was to take at the most 4 hours I was told by the salesman.As he walks in and pulls up a corner of the carpet he says you have asbestos, interesting I’ve had 5 carpet installs from Lowe’s over the years and never a problem in the same room . I call Lowe’s to speak with a manager his response not our problem its a sub contractor.

He took my order number and came out about 10 minutes later, pushed the two packages through my car window and turned around and left. He couldn’t have been anymore snotty if he tried.

We waited, and waited, and waited because their delivery window was 8am to 8pm. At 7:30, I called the number given to me for delivery questions. I was put on hold, cut off, called again, transferred, put on hold ... you know the drill. Fifteen minutes later, I was told that deliveries were running late and that the range was on the truck. Ok. By 9:30, I knew that no range was coming. Next morning I called the delivery number and after being on hold for a while I was told that they couldn't find the range. No, it wasn't on the truck. It wasn't even in the warehouse. They blamed the vendors. I suggested that the range didn't even exist and was told that they would find one and delivery would take place ""in the future."" I cancelled the order, called Best Buy and yes, paid a higher price, but the range is scheduled to come in three days. We've had issues with Lowe's before but enough is enough.

So i put it through again and the money comes off but then a week later it was declined. Still have more than enough money on that card. Then i finally find out its because they dont have the product but they still wanna try a different card.

Lowe's Companies,If there was a lower rating than one…,"If there was a lower rating than one star that is what their delivery system deserves. What a scam! Let me provide this warning now and get that much out of the way. Don't buy appliances from Lowes. I imagine their selection and products are as good as any other place, but their customer service is clearly NOT what I'd call good....or even average....in my book Lowe's customer service after a sale is horrible. ANGRY 🙁☹😤😵Ok... So here is what happened. In the first place they had scheduled our work for Thursday. They wont give you a time when you make the appointment, only the day. Then the day prior to your appointment you get an automatic call from the delivery people who give you a 'WINDOW'. Not a real person to talk to, just a computer message. Ours was 10:00 am to 2:00pm. It was after 3:00pm when the delivery guy called to say he was on the way and would arrive in about 10 min.I was already a little ticked that they were an hour late but I hurried home and the guy showed up soon after I got home. At this point you are thinking....woo hoo...finally!!!! Keep in mind this was the second day in a week that they were scheduled to our house...but the first time they never showed up and no one even called. My joy was very short lived. The guy looked at the water line that we had installed and said he did not have the right connection to do the job and told me they have those at Lowes and are about $5. He handed me the ""wrong"" connection that I could use to swap for the right one. I asked him if he would stay because I can drive out to Lowes, make the swap, and be back in probably less than 30 minutes. He said he would wait. I rushed out to the store, and at first the appliance department told me they don't carry the kind of item that I described. I asked them why the installation people would not have a variety of hook ups with them in their giant Lowes truck...and that was when I got REALLY, REALLY, REALLY pissed off.They informed me that Lowes doesn't do deliveries and installations...that is a part of the process that Lowes has handed off to a contractor...a company that is separate from Lowes and essentially once the item is out of the door at the store it is no longer a Lowes problem so they were real perturbed at me because I didn't arrange for the correct attachment prior to the appointment with the delivery guy. Keep in mind....the delivery dude arrived in a big truck with LOWES written all over it in giant letters. I told him I don't know a damn thing about installing and setting up a refrigerator and had no idea what would be needed...and that was why I had counted on Lowes to take care of that!!!!! He still tried to make it my fault even then. I think it sort of dawned on him after a little more conversation that I was really pissed and he wasn't making it better. He then took me over to the plumbing parts section and he found the item that I probably need.I say probably need because when I got back home...about 35 minutes after I had left and the installation guy and his big Lowes truck were gone....Wife said he never said a thing to her about leaving and he did not call. I tried calling the cell phone number on which he had called Camilla but got no answer. Called Lowes then and asked to speak with the manager...I told them if they can't get the fridge installed tomorrow they can plan on picking it us and I want our money back. He sounded a ""little bit"" sorry for the issue and said he would set up the delivery himself...it can't be any sooner that Saturday. Of course that all depends on whether the stars are lined up just right...that the moon is in it's second phase, and that it's a non leap year....if all of those happen we might see delivery completed Saturday....DON'T BUY APPLIANCES FROM LOWES. In talking to a Lowes employee who works at the customer service desk at a local Lowes she said delivery issues are a constant problem since Lowes stopped doing their own deliveries. She spends much of her day trying to explain the system which none of the employees like and even store managers are stuck with this corporate-level decision.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Dont shop at Lowes,"We spent $1000 on a washer, and first of all they delivered a broken washer. Because my boyfriend and I both have typical jobs, we could not be there for the instillation. Someone did not do their job because they installed a broken washer. It took three days to even get someone on the phone. Once we did get someone on the phone, we had to explain over and over again the washer was broken. It was not starting. It was plugged in, but nothing happens. They had to send someone out to make sure it was broken, which was a complete waste of time. The guy that came knew NOTHING about appliances. Once we got information about getting a new washer, more bumps in the road came. First they said that they would come Friday. Friday comes and we get a call saying it is coming tomorrow. They use a third party company and couldn't get it to us that day. The lady on the phone made it seem like it was our fault. She was rude to my boyfriend. We bought the washer two weeks ago and still do not have it installed. The customer service is truly laughable. No one knows what they are doing and they are extremely rude to customers. They hire people who do not know anything about installing appliances, and people who honestly do not care about anything. I truly never want to step foot in Lowes again. This experience was one of the worst experiences I have truly ever had with a store like Lowes. I will take my business somewhere else.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes is Unreliable!,"Lowes is unreliable when it accepts orders for materials erroneously listed as being in stock when not. This is exacerbated when they don't call the customer to tell them they are not keeping the delivery date and time thus leaving them at the job site waiting for a no show. Combined with the numerous failed attempts to establish communications with a responsive Lowes representative, being advised that the item is not in stock at the store and a truck will be sent to another store on the following day is frustrating at best. Again waiting for a callback on the following day only to learn that the representative is waiting for confirmation that the item is in stock at another store because he has no confidence in the website citation of stock being available is unacceptable, but customer has no choice but to remain in Limbo. Having to wait another three days for an uncertain delivery is very frustrating and makes a customer regret not dealing with Home Depot instead of Lowes.",0,1

THEN when it shows up, it's missing one of the freaking items! And of course, I spend another hour trying to reach someone, and can't get ahold of a single person. It's like the entire store is at lunch. I will never ever order from Lowe's again. Worst experience ever. Oh, and I like how they still charged me for it, to which I had to dispute it. I have always preferred Lowe's over Home Depot, but two of the doors I ordered from them showed up the very next morning with no issues... just saying. Time to close these Lowe's credit cards.

I almost lost one of our dogs this past week because of the poor workmanship- they were quick to take my 2400.00 but not quick to get this fixed- Nobody gives a damn and their response time and communication is horrible- As soon as this is fixed- I am closing my account- I will never buy a thing from Lowes again and would never recommend to anyway- Try Home Depot or Menards for service and quality",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes Pella window - Greg Disalvio…,"We had someone come out to give us an estimate on getting 14 Pella windows installed. This was at the McCandless Crossing store in Pittsburgh. The person that Lowes sent out was Greg Disalvio. He was extremely unprofessional and made some chicken scratch on a notepad as his measurements. He said he would get back to me within 5 days with an estimate. It is now over a month since he was in our house with nothing from him, not even a note or call to apologize for his delays. I can understand a delay of a few days or even a week, but not over a month after him promising he would get us the quote shortly. He did provide a quick, incoherent quote when I forced the issue and visited the local store. But it was totally incorrect and did not detail what we asked for. On an aside, our neighbors across the street from us also had a very bad experience with Greg Disalvio and Lowes. It's over a year that they are waiting on the proper windows to show up. DO NOT order any windows and doors from Lowes under any circumstances, especially if you have to deal with Greg Disalvio. Very poor response and total lack of professionalism. It also seems that the sales associates in the store know very little to nothing about what they're trying to sell. They are very poor and don't help much. Do yourself a favor and if you have to go to a big box store, try Home Depot. Much more knowledgeable, more courteous, more helpful, and they do care about their customers. The same can certainly NOT be said for Lowes. They are terrible.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,What a nightmare!,"A few days ago I bought a gas stove for one of my rentals, it’s not the first time I have purchased a high priced appliance for my tenants. I purchased the stove with the added hardware for installation, delivery and disposal of the old unit. BAD choice! The delivery was on time, but the delivery guys, according to my tenants, didn’t know what they were doing. For starters, they didn’t have tools, my tenant had to loan them their tools for the installation. The following day, I get a call from my tenants reporting a gas smell in the house. I immediately call Lowe’s and ask them to speak with my tenants about going there to see what was the problem. My tenants told me they were going to come out the next day. REALLY!!! There was a gas leak and they were not going to address it immediately. WOW! My tenant said, they would cut the gas of at the wall and not use the stove for one day. The next day my tenant calls me saying they keep calling Lowe’s but Lowe’s keep putting them on hold then disconnects their call. Unbelievable! Finally, the guys that put the stove in call me and say they are heading over, I give them my tenants ph number, which they should have had already. They call me a little later and say they can’t fix the problem because the don’t have the correct connection part. I replied, “I purchased all the parts need for the installation, how come you don’t have the part for the installation?” They said,”it wasn’t in the bag. They said, my tenant told them to just put a bunch of thread putty around and it would be okay.” I told them to go back and get the part they needed to complete the installation. Their reply, “we have spent too much time here and needed to leave.” There’s a leak and they were going to leave. Unbelievable! Later my tenant said, he did not tell them to just use the pipe putty, they lied about that. He said, during the installation the guys noticed a couple of small dents on the stove, my tenant said, they were really small and not noticeable, that’s what he told them not to worry about. Anyway, I ended up having to hire someone else to hook up the stove properly. What a nightmare! The next time I need an appliance I will try Home Depot or someone else.",0,1

Sold us a product they didn't really have, made it difficult to change the order, delivery driver was rude, then couldn't figure out how to refund the difference on settling for a lower priced unit that they did have in stock.

I attempted to contact the Madison Heights, MI store several times via phone with no answer. I had to go up to the store a total of 3 times before anyone was able to help me. I had promised follow ups without ANY follow up at all. They claimed to have lost the carpet and then found it. I was then told installation wouldn't be for up to 1 month and a half from when I ordered the carpet. The day of installation I received a call stating the installers could not make it due to car troubles. Then was promised first thing next day. Installation was smooth once they were able to make it. Lowes offered next to nothing in reimbursement and the manager from corporate side was rude and less than empathetic to my time and the effort that I had put in to receiving my product. If you want to go with Lowes for any installation purposes definitely think twice because the time YOU put in is not worth the money they charge. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!",0,1

Last time we orderrd vanity with granite counter top, we told these morons not to glue on the granite or the under mount sinks because we had to haul it up stairs. They said ok. So i took off work on the day they were supposed to delivery, they never showed up. 2 days later they dropped the vanity in our driveway upside down with granite on concrete driveway ( talk about some dumb people ,). So i had to have my 3 neighbors help me move it in my garage, once we got in it garage we noticed those morons glued the sinks in andvtye granite, so now it weighs about 400 pounds. So we had to now find a moving company that cost us more money to have them move it up stairs to bathroom, took 2 months to find someone, so they showed up today and tipped the vanity up right znd we seen a big crack in the granite (unreal).

I have had to call weekly and still do not have the item. It is in the Lowe's facility I'm told, but still not to the Topeka store? This has been since October 5th again with a communication I had to initiate. This is absolutely ridiculous. It is now October 17th and I still do not have the dishwasher and being told Topeka still does not have it in their store. Again through communication I had to initiate. I will never buy from Lowe's again.

Lowe's Companies,Very upset customer,"I was at Lowe’s at Lancaster Ohio today. I purchased a sink and Fossetts to go with it.

She then wanted to look at my drivers license. I showed it to her,she punched in a few numbers and said there I got it. When I got home and looked at my receipt real close, I never got my VA discount. I’ll feel though if the girl Could not get my VA discount for me she should’ve asked someone else or sent me to the service desk instead of lying to me and said she had it.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Beware of Lowes,"On June 11, 2020 I paid in full for 240 linear feet of aluminum fencing to be installed on my property. The fencing material was delivered to the Lowes store two full months later. Perhaps due to the pandemic. Understandable if so. After getting the run around from Lowes on late delivery to my house, the material finally was delivered to my house with several of the panels being damaged beyond usage. I got nothing but the run around from Lowes as to how and where the damage occurred. They even went as far as to say they accept damaged shipments from their suppliers. Who would do that? The damaged panels were re-ordered and Lowes told me those arrived damaged. Lowes yet again re-ordered the damaged panels. It is now four complete, entire months since I signed and paid for the fence contract and I still do not have my fence installed. There is a LOT more to this very sad and pathetic story, I’m condensing it here for briefness. BEWARE of Lowes.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Flooring Install Experience,"Since my time expired to do my Lowe' Survey. I am sending Lowe's Survey Support an email.My first project with Lowe's on flooring was the worst experience I have ever had with any Home Improvement store!The buying experience, of course, was great! But when they sent the install team out. The experience was horrible to the end. They were not as experienced as they should have been.1st, Day 1- Installers arrive after 9. Should have arrived at the job by 8:30. Our floor was not even and Lowe's knew this because I told them when purchasing the flooring! However, when installers started the job we told them about the uneven floor and they suggested cardboard to make the floor even instead of suggesting COMPOUND. When they did use the compound. My husband advised them that there wasn't enough compound to make the spot even. They advised him it was fine and began installing. 2nd, Day 2- Installers arrive after 10. Because they arrived so late in the morning they were at our house until 10pm! Needless to say they did not even finish the job and some of what they did was horribly done. There was not enough quarter round because they used the material in the wrong area so they couldn't finish that, the caulking was horribly done, some planks had knife cuts on them due to manufacturing error but they were used anyway and the floor was still uneven. Mind you we were left with no planks. 3rd Now I am trying to get the uneven floor fixed and get the quarter round finished with Lowe's and the experience is just as horrible!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,DO NOT GO TO LOWES NEWTON!!!!!,"We are good, honest people. We are trying to watch our pennies as covid has hit all areas of our business too. However, we are very bad with receipts and sometimes need help from our suppliers. Trying to return trees to the Newton NJ store was a horror show. While I tried to explain we use many credit cards, sometimes give our workers cash, and we do not do a good job with receipts. The ""Assistant Store Manager Jess"" stayed firm in her decision not to credit a $ 13.00 tree that died without the proper paperwork. She did show me that in the return cart was a Home Depot plant - Thanks! After all I was dirty, in a tee shirt and jeans and may have looked like I was trying to get a free tree - please note not all Vice Presidents wear suits. So the $ 13.00 that Jess saved the Newton Lowes in a policy adjustment will result in excess of $ 35,000 a year that will now be spent at the orange competitor up the block. I will also tell all of our employees, all of the fellow trades we deal with, and all of our renters that any professional courtesies that you may expect to get will not be provided as Lowes has ""Rules"" that are not meant to be broken. By the way, I went to the Home Depot who took their plants back and pointed out they have additional discounts via their pro program. Shame we really liked Lowes in the beginning.",0,1

She told me I had an incomplete profile and she couldn't find my contact information even though the local store could pull up the order and see my profile. Totally incompetent.

I bought a large amount of dirt, gravel for a project and was going back to get 3 pallets of dirt for my back yard, plus 30+ bags of rocks. I still have all I purchased I'm waiting on my house to be finished painted before doing my yard. I was told I got my discount but I didn't. I went back today to get it and they said ""well it's over 30 days and you can't get it"". I figure my discount is around $40-$50 and here I am about to spend $600+ on even more after spending $500. So what I understand, if I want to get my discount, I need to bring all the product back and return it and then buy it again? So instead of me buying $600+ more, why don't I return what I bought and just get my money back and you lose out on $1100+ of purchase since you guys fail every time to get my discount right.

Lowe's Companies,A flooring nightmare,"It’s difficult to sum up such an extremely frustrating experience, but I’ll try my best. The initial agreement with Lowe’s was that our cork flooring install would likely be completed prior to our move-in date to our new home. Instead, on move-in day, we were met with a partially completed kitchen floor due to running out of flooring, visible gold underlayment along the edges of various areas due to such jagged cuts, and two improperly installed areas that clearly needed to be redone. When we finally gathered the fortitude to call Lowe’s to finish the job, we were told the original subcontractors were let go due to their ineptitude. The new subcontractors assessed the situation and agreed to finishing the job and redoing the two areas with original installation issues. Unfortunately, the one issue required the entire living room/dining room floor to be ripped up in order to have a leveling compound added. This resulted in our large living space turning into a sea of mud that would not dry for a week, which would have been much longer had I not finally lost my patience; only then did they suddenly came up with a quick fix. When the job was finally completed, almost a year later I might add, instead of relief, we were faced with lost wages due to my not being able to work from home many days due to the continued work or failed attempts at work, the costs of having to eat out for many meals which we typically avoid, the stress of it all of course particularly on our young children, and most importantly, the fact that the new crew sawed all boards inside our house without our knowledge or consent. When the job was completed, we were met with thick piles of dust throughout all the floors and on all countertops, and it literally took a month or more to clean dust from all the cupboards, etc. Unfortunately, we also learned at our next a/c maintenance appointment that our secondary air cleaner had died and that our air ducts needed cleaning; both were fine at our last appointment so logic would say that the extreme amounts of saw dust caused the issues. The cost? Over 1K for a new air unit and about 700 for duct cleaning. I should also add that the two issues that were “redone” only have new issues - the living room floor now has a very large bubble and the hall area has a visible gap between floorboards. We decided we’d personally rather live with the issues than deal with Lowe’s any further. The basic message is this - spend a few “extra” dollars to go with another contractor, not a subcontractor through Lowe’s!",0,1

She thought she had my wife on hold one times during their conversation but she didn’t my wife could hear everything she was saying. This young lady Deanina and another young lady by the name of Dawn thought it was funny to leave my wife on hold for a long time cause they did not want to deal with the issue. They joked about having to use the restroom while thinking my wife was on hold. When my wife said excuse me she again hung up on her. My wife called right back Deanina told my wife she was not smart enough to answer my wife’s questions about our purchase. At this time Dawn speaks with my wife. She told us we have to come and pick the refrigerator up on our own. So low and behold we arrive at the store at 6:58 pm and who is the very rude young lady helping us yes Deanina and Dawn. Deanina was even more ruder in person. Dawn was nice at this point. Me and my wife had enough at this point. We ask for the manager paid in full for our purchase and spoke with Gary the manager. He did nothing about the situation but say he was sorry. This will be the last time we ever spend our hard earn money with this store awful customer service. We have called corporate and made them aware of situation. Let’s see how they handle this.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Gray mullet unfriendly employee!!,"Was trying to buy varnish and as my boyfriend went to take it off the shelf, he knocked over a store sign which had been hanging off the shelf crooked. There was an employee at Lowe’s in Kailua Kona with gray long hair, almost looked like a mullet, a man in his 50-60s unloading a pallet. Rather than ask if my boyfriend was okay, he shook his head at us. My BF approached him and said sorry, he ignored him. This man was horrible! He ruins your store! Should not be around the public!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes mistreats workers,I worked at lowes briefly and the company treats their employees terribly. Managers regularly reprimand workers for little things that don't matter and will yell at them for the slightest mistake. I have observed this where I worked as well as other locations. HR basically doesn't exist so if you're being harrassed no one does anything. I experienced this myself and observed someone else being harrassed during the short time I worked there. During the short time I was there I also witnessed multiple workers quit because managment expected to much of them. The company and the store managment also didn't take covid-19 seriously until well into the pandemic and didn't take any precautions until our state government forced them to.Please treat retail workers with the utmost respect and kindness. They've got one of the worst jobs working for companies like lowes.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,LOWES REBATES,"I purchased a John Deer e110 riding mower on May 28th 2020 from Lowes. It was promoted as having a rebate of $200.00 if purchased before June 3rd. When checking out, I received a rebate receipt with info on my purchase that was to be submitted on line on Lowes rebate site which I did on May 29th . I received electronic conformation with acknowledgement and referance number from the rebate center the same day. It was to take 6-8 wks to process. After numerous calls to rebate center and 16 weeks later it still was processing. I made one final call on October 1st and received a new reference number for future inquiries. That night I received an e-mail Saying my rebate had been denied. No explanation. The rebate center is located in South America. I called Lowes customer service national center to register my complaints twice which they have record of.. Lowes was no help at all. A rip off to get you to buy from them.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I hate lowes,I hate lowes. Their power/hand tools brands are trash compared to home depot so ill never shop there for anything else. The brands they carry are the near equivalent of going to walmart or harbor freight. How the hell do you not sell any Milwaukee tools? they are the most popular brand of tools in america. Craftsman and dewalt are trashcan brands. Its why I always say lowes is for housewives and home depot is for contractors or people who care. It bugs me that lowes is closer to my home and I have to pass by it every time i go to home depot. I dont care how lazy im feeling ill always drive the extra 10-15 minutes for quality.,0,1

So I call Lowe’s online where they tell me, that they cannot honor the store price for the same sod b/c they cannot see that discount in their system and when I offered to take a picture of the sign, they tell me that store sod and online sod (same bluegrass sod) have different product numbers so they couldn’t honor even when shown proof!!!

Lowe's Companies,Customer Service and Return Policies,"My elderly mother purchased a $175 kitchen faucet at the Valdosta Georgia Lowes store. Its a Delta Savile faucet. After, approximately, 3 to 4 months of use the faucet starting leaking, would not shut off completely. She paid for a plumbing service call, $95, the technician tighten bonnet assembly (which corrected the problem for a short period of time) but explained that the fixture was defective and would need to be replaced. She purchased a brand new faucet, same brand, different model. The personnel at customer service (Valdosta Georgia) said to bring back the OLD fixture after replacing the NEW one and LOWE'S would credit her for the defective Delta faucet. It was another month or so before I could return to Georgia (because I live in Florida) and replace the faucet for my 86 year old mother. By this time 180 days had elapsed and AFTER being told there would be NO problems returning this item, Customer Service (Valdosta) informed my mother they CAN NOT honor their return policy for her. Believing this was a disservice and quit frankly, dishonest, after being told there would be no problems, she wrote the CORPORATE OFFICE a letter explaining the situation and as of this day (10-03-20) 2 months later absolutely ZERO response from Lowe's. I am personally deeply disappointed with the lack of integrity at the local level and especially with the corporate office. No response of any kind is not acceptable. If this is an example of Lowe's policies and proceeds, my business will be placed elsewhere. Also, I will share this experience with others for review. I'm very sad because I've had many years of quality service and product from Lowe's and for it to end in this manner would greatly disappoint me. I do hope Lowe's will step up and correct this issue so I can change my opinion and review. Thank you for reading! Update: October 17th, 2020. Lowes never responded, I finally called the corporate office in Wilkesboro, NC. They would NOT consider any refund whatsoever. Referred me to their policies. Very disappointed and will do business elsewhere and with other supply chain. Really taken back by Lowe's lack of any compromise. They wouldn't even meet me halfway with a gift card or anything.

Lowe's Companies,Request for installation and price quote for house,"I requested Lowes to send out their third party company they use for plumbing and countertops on 9/9/20. 10 days later the company ""Handy"" called to make appt. to come out to my house. A representative came to take pictures, measurements and talk with me about my needs. So I did not receive an email or phone call from ""Handy"" about what could be done or what were my options until 10/2/20. On the voice mail that I received stated that the work for an under mount sink replacement was out of their scope of business. Well what a disappointment. No options left such as a new countertop could be installed and no estimate on the plumbing that I requested either. Nothing at all after all this time. Wow. My recommendation to other customers seeking help with installations is to go to another company. Lowes cannot handle your business because it is out of them scope (limited ability). Project number 647864372Bar code 466478643727Funny part is at the bottom of work order Lowes has statement ""For reliable, professional installation service offerings at a great price, Lowe's is your best resource: "" . There is more at the bottom about Guaranteed satisfaction, professional independent installers and contact through out your installation experience.

Lowe's Companies,Never buy from lowes!,"We bought a fridge from lowes in January and it was supposed to be delivered in February because our old one went up. We didn't have a fridge till we got a new one. We have 4 young children in our home so its crucial to be able to feed them something other than fast food. Anyways the delivery date comes and goes, no fridge! The fridge didnt end up showing up till end of March/beginning of April. When it arrived the delivery workers said it would take 24-48 hours for the fridge to get to temperature. So I signed everything as there was no physical damage. 2 days later it was still sitting at 65 degrees on the coldest setting. I called lowes.com they told me to call the store it was delivered from (martinsburg wv) blowing me off. I call the local store and the girl I talked to told me they won't replace it i would have to call factory lg service for repairs. That was the beginning of a long, long process. 5 months later many repair appointments (Dave with factory services was super polite and told me it should be replaced but his boss would not allow it. He was the only good part of this ordeal) and parts replaced later as well as every manager (Jose Hernandez, Richard malone, and cody belcastro) I talked to over the time promised they would see it was replaced and subsequently blew me off and never got back to me! During those 5 months I had no way to buy groceries for my kids till I went out and spent $500 on a used appliance because I couldn't afford another brand new fridge. I bought that fridge about 3 weeks ago. Back to the fridge I bought from lowes company, while the fridge sits around 40 degrees at its coldest setting under the fan in the back of the fridge, which is not good and I do not consider fixed, I am done trying to get them to fix it. This company obviously wont replace it and clearly cant fix it so I give up. We have bought many items from lowes including a snowblower, lawnmower, weed eaters, washer and dryers, and microwave, and an oven, and were very loyal customers we will not be anymore. I will take our business elsewhere since they do not stand by their products and it's been 6 months since I received a fridge that didnt work in the 1st place. I had to feed my kids fast food for 6 months because of their crappy customer service and even worse product. I had to spend an extra $500 to buy another used fridge because the brand new one didn't work and they would do nothing.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,On August 31 Ishmeal helped me buy a drill,"On August 31, 2020 I went to my local Lowe's (store 387 Battleground Avenue, Greensboro, NC) to buy a drill. Now, I have never purchased a drill in my life so I had no idea what I was looking for or even the verbage on the packaging. I was looking at all the various and sundry drills (who knew there was such a variety from which to choose). A very polite young man approached me and asked if he could help. I explained my situation and that I was looking for a drill for home use, nothing project heavy, just simple fixes around the house. Ishmeal was fabulous!! He asked relevant questions (some of which I never thought of) was patient and answered each one of my questions without judgement. After some discussion and his showing me the various drills (who ever heard of a hammer drill?? haha), I was debating on which I wanted to purchase when Ishmeal stated, hang on a minute, I'll be right back. He came back and announced he had the perfect drill for me. Ishmeal searched the inventory that wasn't on the floor and handed me a Dewalt Brushless Hammer drill that just happened to be on SALE!! It is the perfect, perfect drill! I absolutely love it but the best thing in the whole wide world is that is has this awesome little light turns on when the trigger is pressed. Oh. My. Gosh. It is wonderful and so is Ishmeal. I am forever grateful for such a wonderful experience!! I cannot begin to express my gratitude. Ishmeal is the BEST!! I do believe he could do with a raise.

I cried all the way home. I still can't believe it as I will continue to shop at Naya location. Naya made feel as a very satisfied customer.

I bought a new shower but when the contractors hired by Lowe's tried to install the doors, they told me they didn't know how to install those specific shower doors and left.

Lowe's Companies,Completely and totally honest review of the last two years,"this review is not only about lowes.com it's about my local Lowes brick and mortar store. Are used to have high regards for Lowe's back when I only had to pick up a random shovel or a power tool was on sale. However since my husband passed away a couple of years ago, I have become the handyman/woman of sorts at home. Not because I want to but because I don't have the money to hire service people to come to my home or builders either. I have taken numerous courses at our local community college as well as taken in numerous tips and tricks from others in order to be able do certain things. These jobs always require a trip to Lowe's which I have completely become to despise! It does not matter what department I go into or which level of associate I deal with, these people know less than I do about anything (& i already admitted that I know nothing about home improvement) having to do with what the store stands for in general! If you can breathe you can be hired at Lowe's from anything from a bathroom cleaner and wood cutter to the manager. Seriously. Do you know what happens when you ask assistance from a Lowe's employee?? They pull out their phone and ask Google❗️ That is a 100% fact! Upon having this done to me four times I finally was blessed with an assistant managers presence and I graciously asked before he went for his telephone for an answer to my question, ""What is going on here at Lowe's? Why does every one here draw a blank and have to Google every single question for assistance?"" His response was ""pardon me?"" I just walked away. lowes.com sucks in every way being since they are only Wish by another name now because nothing from their online platform is even associated with a Lowe’s store other than do you acquire it through their website. The products are not those products at all but they are from private sellers like you and me but are mostly shipped from other countries. One would think that the actual store would at least have a reputation to hold up. They do not. Below I'm going to list the items that I went to my North Carolina Lowe's Home improvement store to get the last 4 times and this happened to me every time.1. drill bits for the drill i purchased last week.(box in hand)2. Bosch bush axe.3. entrance gate hardware(The piece that holds the gate onto the post)4. vent cover for top of my house.5. A folding shelf bracket. As if I had not already researched these items online as I needed them, which was every couple of weeks or so for a different item. Each time I left the store with Nothing and disgusted to no end. Even though I would find these items on their Website I was still told they had no idea or although it said available in store, they were only available at lowe's .com. As for the vent cover and folding shelf bracket-- They've never heard of any such item in their lives! Granted I'm not the brightest crayon in the box and I own that fact However, if you ever get wind of me working a job in Lowe's home improvement stores, please report me to some type of authorities because I have done lost whatever Remnants left of my damn mind. As of two days ago, MY LAST visit to Lowe's, WAS my LAST to lowe's❗️ I will from that moment on be driving the 26.8 miles away to my closest Home Depot! EVERY TIME!

I told them I had cancelled the order, he said ‘no problems’ and went his merry way.. this company is horrible.

When I went to install diffuser, I found it to have a crack on its side. I wrote GoodEarth an email on 9/24 and visited Lowes in North Smithfield RI 9/26. I stood on the blue square at the 'Returns', waiting to explain problem to clerk. As I waited, 2 guys just walked in from the other side and was seen buy a 'returns' clerk. None of the clerks noticed that I had been waiting, obeying Covid guidelines. I think Lowe's needs a behavior lesson. And when I saw clerk, i was told the unit would have to be detached from ceiling. It wasn't an easy mount. Although I think the light pan was a little bent, I like the lighting fixture but I think Lowe's could have better quality assurance. I bought a screen door from them a few years ago and had them install - the lath failed within a week and theyu did return to replace - Since they are in the improvement business, perhaps they could embrace the self-improvement business.

Lowe's Companies,0 star,"0 starI made an order on the 22 of august and wanted it delivered. They said that because some items were missing they could only deliver on the 15 of September, which is incredibly bad service. Half of what I order wasn´t delivered on the 15 but billed none the less. When speaking to customer service I was just sent around and mocked by getting the same questions by different people and not getting the manager. At one time I was told they would look into things and give me a callback. Of course, I didn´t get any callback. Update. It is now 13 October and I haven´t received everything. Endless phone calls have had no success and when told that I will be getting a phone call back, nobody calls. I´m am getting people to receive deliveries that I being told will happen and again and again, I have to carry that cost when nothing is delivered. I have made 16 phone calls and every one costs a lot of time and anger as one is endlessly mocked by being sent north and south without ever getting any resolution. Never ever buy anything from Lowes.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Zero stars,"Zero stars. Purchased a dishwasher and had installed by Lowe’s. Unqualified contractor hired by Lowe’s. broke a part under my sink. Flooded my kitchen. Tried to charge me for fixing! Wait , it gets better. The installer brought in a blank piece of paper for me to sign for install. Yea no! So they can forge it later saying install went ok??? Fought w them for 3 days to file a claim. Filed complaint with BBB as well for refund of my install fee. They are so shady. Lied to BBB saying repairs were made on 9/8/2020 which they weren’t. I just submitted an estimate for repairs this week? They closed my BBB complaint without my knowledge. I’m not satisfied with the install and requested a refund. I’ve now been stonewalled and can’t get any help with this at all. Rude staff. Rude corporate employees. Can’t get through the CEO. Never again will i spend another dime in this shady company!!

Lowe's Companies,Very poor customer service,"Lowe’s has always been my go to store for all my needs in and out of my house from appliances, wood works/fencing, paint to all parts that requires replacement and/ or repairs. Recently I had a visit to the location at Roseville, CA in the flooring department. Two people that works there in the flooring department seems like you’re more of a nuisance when you ask questions. They don’t even acknowledge you when you’re there just arm’s length waiting for them to see you. It seems like they pretend they don’t see you or possibly they just don’t care if you’re there. Very very poor customer service. So I approached this one guy that works in the flooring department and ask him very politely if he can see me next after whatever he is doing and also if he could give me an approximate time and possibly make an appointment to come back. And he just answered very rudely saying” it will be faster if I don’t get interrupted”. I said “wow”. Am I in Lowe’s?? All the past years and experiences I’ve been shopping to this location were really great so I cannot believe I am at the same place. Well.., I still love you’re place and will continue to shop at your company. Great prices and products . But please don’t let this kind of customer service ruin your 5 star reputation.",0,1

Mind you they want payment up front but they don't have to do the work after payment. It has been a month and they said the installers have been called to finish the job. NO CALLS !! So just got off phone at Lowes and was told that they didn't know that I had already receive the strips so they did not call installers!!! I said that we where at the store a month ago and where given the strips, so now again I have to wait to the installers call to finish the job.

Lowe's Companies,Don’t buy a thing from Lowe’s that requires delivery and set up!,I had a terrible experience with Home Depot that prompted me to switch my business to Lowe’s. It has been a nightmare to work with this company too. Do not purchase from either companies!

The first delivery person spoke zero English. Just please find another way to order your supplies.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Save yourself unnecessary stress and shop elsewhere.,"Goodness. Shop at Home Depot or Menard's or any other store than Lowes. Our experience has been crazy terrible. If you order anything online, be aware (as I've been told by employees now) that the order goes into limbo- it is not reported to the store. This means that if it is delayed for any reason, the store doesn't know and cannot contact you. We ordered 4 appliances from Lowes on July 5 and have yet to see 3 of them now in late September. We have had 4 delivery dates. They were supposed to come tomorrow (our 3rd delivery date) and we just got another delay message. Calling corporate is helpful- they are able to research where your items actually are- and gave us a % discount for our 3 month wait... but a friend ordered new appliances from Home Depot 2 weeks ago and they are scheduled to deliver in 2 weeks. So...?Yes- COVID has delayed things, but I think that Lowe's might have already had terrible tracking and delivery systems before this, and COVID has multiplied these issues 10-fold. I am writing this review so that if you are buying large items where timeliness is important (ie- no kitchen for 2 months)- do not buy from Lowe's. They have a mess going on, and I would love to save you from the same mistake we made.",0,1

When my husband and I asked why he (a healthy appearing person) didn’t wear a mask. He said he was a math teacher and had done “the numbers” which didn’t support him wearing one. There was a heated discussion, I later called and left a message for the Lowe’s management to call me back. I have not heard a word from him.

Lowe's Companies,8am-8pm Delivery - Can't even make that!!!,"Online it only tells you delivery of our washer and dryer between 8am and 8pm. Yesterday my wife calls to ask if she can at least know morning or afternoon. The lady on the phone from the 2nd street store was rude and would not help look up the order status. Today I called an OKC Lowe’s, and a helpful gentleman was able to inform me it was being delivered from the Kelly and Covell location. I call that location, and get put on hold for over 5 minutes without even having been asked if I mind holding. After the long hold I still don’t know... a) when the delivery might arrive, b) if our merchandise is verified on a truck scheduled for delivery, or c) why we haven’t been contacted with an ETA in the day of delivery.At the time of writing this, the associate named Garrett ( who was helpful) had earlier told me he would have a manager call me back per my request. Garrett calls me back. I ask why the manager did not call me, he would only say manager put it back on him. So Garrett was helpful, but the expectation was set that a manager would call me, and that did not get followed thru. Not a big deal in itself, but added to the poor communication and customer service up to this point, it rubbed me the wrong way. It is now 3:53 pm and we are told delivery will be from 4-6. Still no explanation as to why we weren’t notified that the equipment was set on the truck for today with an ETA. Hopefully the delivery drivers will be helpful and all products are in good condition. I don’t know how much money needs to be spent for good customer service, clear communication, and for expectations that are set to be met... but I know it must be more than $2200. If the delivery guys are helpful and polite to my wife, I’ll upgrade my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.Update: at 3:53 pm I was told our washer and dryer will be delivered between 4 and 6pm. At 6:30pm still no delivery. I finally get a manager who tells me the delivery driver who had our appliances clocked out at 4:30. He then had the gall to tell me he was working on it. From 4:30 to 6:30 when I called, literally NO ONE was working on it. We waited 2 months for this order and are seriously considering canceling it altogether. My original 2 star is downgraded to 1. Simple mistakes can be tolerated, but for $2200 this has been a complete sh** show!",0,1

In the morning on the day of delivery, the driver called me and said that he could deliver the gas range, but the countertop was not in the warehouse and they would bring it to me on another day. Three days passed, the money was withdrawn from me, but the countertops were never delivered. Although my account has the status delivered. I called customer service, waited about an hour and a half listening to music, after which I decided to drive to the local store. The worker said that I should be given a delivery date and that they would call me in a few hours. Another day was lost. The next day I had to go to that store again, since no one called me. and I still haven't received what I ordered online. A disgruntled worker said he canceled the delivery. I saw that he canceled my end cups for the countertop. Maybe he got it wrong? The next day, I went back to the same local store to sort things out again. I was already furious, the employee canceled the order for countertops without my consent and just gave me a refund check. This was the limit for me. I haven't seen such a service for a long time.

Lowe's Companies,Not worth ordering anything from Lowe's as customer service doesn't help solve issues.,"The outdoor dining set I purchased is gorgeous, and my review has no reflection upon the beauty of the set itself; I am solely writing about Lowe's inability to see issue's through. I've never written a bad review anywhere for anything ever, but my experience merits complaint. I don't like reading lengthy reviews from others, so the gist is that if you need something resolved by Lowe's customer service, THEY WILL NOT GET THE JOB DONE.The detail is, one of our chair backs arrived with some broken welds, and we appropriately needed the chair to be replaced. I ordered this set April of 2020, and have still not received resolution of a chair being replaced from Lowe's to this day. I have called more times than I can count on my two hands to try to get this chair replaced. I've waited on hold and spoke to representatives on the phone for probably 12 hours total. Unfortunately, I had to take this upon myself to fix it. So I researched who Lowe's supplier is, in hopes that I could get a replacement chair. That process took a long while too, but finally the supplier, Almo, sent us a replacement chair backing; although, for some reason they sent us 6 chair backs, when we only needed 1. So now I have 5 extra chair backs to figure out what to do with as we do not have 5 bases, so these 5 backs can not be utilized. Thank you for your generosity and help anyway, Almo.Lowe's, if your customer spends a couple of thousand dollars on your product, your customer is worthy of care and problem solving, not a half a** ""we are sorry ma'am for the inconvenience"".It's a shame that I will not be shopping at Lowe's ever again, and I will tell my friends and family to do the same.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,I give up,"Lowe's has been my go-to ever since Home Depot seemed to stop caring. Seems like Lowe's is now going the same route. Had a delivery for a new wall oven, paid for removal and haul away. I was informed by the gentleman on the initial followup call and delivery schedule phone call, that the removal would not be a problem, and that they would just go ahead install the new one due to the anti-tip bracket. On delivery the two gentlemen notified me that they could not take the old, disconnected, but still sitting in the cabinet oven. It almost felt like they were waiting for some kind of ""what if I slipped you guys a hundred bucks"" or something. Just kind of awkwardly standing around an oven that could easily be lifted by two people, but not just by myself. They left. So now I have an old oven still sitting there. A new oven sitting in the middle of my kitchen floor, and they are having me contact my local Lowe's to get ANOTHER team to come haul away the old one. What the actual F Lowes?!

Had it picked up, traveled 30 minutes again to the store, picked out another (low-end this time). Dishwasher delivered and delivery ""gentleman"" wanted my signature before I inspected. He opened the front of box and said ""see, it has the new blue film on it"". Flippant attitude...I needed him to leave. I open the box once he left, and the dishwasher looked like it had literally been taken out of someone's home and brought to me! There was water IN the dishwasher! I contact Lowes and in my most restrained voice I explain what happened and asked to have the obviously used dishwasher picked up. I was ""corrected"" by the ""gentleman"" in the appliance department, as he said ""they test them out at the factory to make sure they work""! What! They must have tested it 10 minutes before I received it because there was WATER in the dishwasher and it smelled like detergent. End result, that person said ""I'll let the delivery company know you want it changed out, and they'll call you when they can get back out there""!!!The Lowes Corporation has not only lost an individual customer, but you have lost my business as a Contractor too!",0,1

I talked to the manager before this and he told me customers load their own stuff all the time. I am sure they do, but we are talking extremely heavy equipment that takes more than one person to load. We've seen employees soliciting help from customers coming in the store. They were asking for the customers to help them load someone else's heavy items. Someone is going to get hurt and Lowes could be sued. Lowes should hire people that are willing and able to load heavy equipment. I feel this shows bad management.",0,2

I went it today to lowes to purchase soil only to be told no again. I have my military ID....that should be proof enough to earn my discount, not some silly loyalty card that Lowes doesn't care enough to fix. I asked why Lowes requires the loyalty card, they claim to be ripped off by people who aren't worthy of the discount. Well now, the people that are worthy can't get it due to someone not doing their job in paperwork. No where on my account is my ex's name but yet thru my phone number somehow, he still pulls up. Another thing, not all wives share their husbands last name. the fact the only one name can be used on the loyalty card is crap. Home Depot has been getting my business for the past three weeks. Considering I just moved into a new house that needed updates, Lowes has lost an good amount of money from me. I used to be a very loyal Lowes customer. Now Home Depot and Ace Hardware will be receiving my business. They only require to see my military ID vice a silly loyalty card to give me a discount.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Patio Door Order Nightmare,"I tried to order a patio door from Lowe's and experience was so awful that I've decided to go elsewhere. I had the detail done to confirm the measurement and went back to the store during a weeknight to put in the final order for the door. My boyfriend and I pressed the help button at the door counter and waited about 15 minutes before anyone came by to help. After the associate came and I explained that I wanted to purchase the door, he spend 30 minutes trying to find the file folder that had the information from my detail. He finally figured out how to pull it up on the computer after calling a manager on the phone. I told him the brand I wanted to buy, and instead of walking through the choices one by one for all the features and confirming my selection, he rushed through the process, sometime selecting the choice for me without asking. A couple times, I had to have him go back so I could make the selection I actually wanted. I even asked him at one point if I could see a picture of what a choice meant and he said it wasn't possible and continued on. Once we finally had the door selected, he printed out all the paperwork and told us to take it to the register to pay. When we got to the register, it turned into a nightmare. The cashier had some sort of issue with the system after scanning our paperwork and decided to move to a different register. She then ran into a different problem on that register and tried to ask another cashier for help. After they couldn't figure it out, we moved back to the original register where she ran into a problem again. We then spent 15 minutes moving back and forth between the two registers going through a process of having her log in and out of the registers and re-scan our paper. It appeared she'd locked our project because she'd scanned it under multiple systems. A manager came over and couldn't figure it out either and took us over to customer service. She called their IT department, which required us to wait another 15 minutes while she stood there on hold. When IT finally came on and the manager was able to successfully scan our paperwork, the door was not populating in our order, only the installation cost. The IT person told her the door was not showing as part of the project. This didn't make sense because when the initial cashier had scanned it during one of the many original attempts, the price of the door had shown. The manager hung up from IT and said they didn't know what they were talking about. She then called the associate that had put together our order to try to ask him why the door wasn't showing as part of the project. He didn't know. After an hour and a half of waiting around while the Lowe's associates fumbled during the whole process, the manager said she wouldn't be able to check us out and that they'd have to redo the order and call me the next day to have me pay over the phone. I reluctantly said ok and asked if we'd still be able to apply my boyfriend's military discount over the phone. It had been quite the process for him to sign up online as he had to submit paperwork and wait for approval. The manager told me yes, they could do the discount over the phone. At that point, I had some lightbulbs still to purchase that we were also buying. The manager rang them up, but didn't apply the military discount that we'd just discussed. At that point, we were so frustrated and desperate to leave that we couldn't stomach having her refund the order and redo it to apply the discount. It felt as though we'd run into incompetency at every stage of the process and in the end, we still didn't get our door.",0,1

I told him I was considering linoleum where it was a thinner product. He assured me it would be fine, the installers would make a transition board from kitchen to family room. So considering I am not a carpet installer, I agreed, as he was the professional....WHAT A MISTAKE!. He did not take into consideration the height of 3 doors in the room.While installing the carpet, the installer said that one of the 3 doors needed to be cut down, although reluctant I agreed to cutting it( a custom made door).The installers laid the carpet without mentioning the other 2 doors would not fit. Had I known this, I would of stopped the job.One of the doors are our exit door, and while going out several hours later, we were exiting the door only to find we could not open door( mind you, we are seniors and one of our exit doors can not be opened).I immediately called the Lowes where I made the purchase. I was informed it had to be taken up with the installer deptartment of Lowes. I spoke with them, they saud they would send a door specialist to see what could be done with the outside door.I then spoke with the the owner of the install company, and was assured he would come to check out the situation. Needless to day, we wasted our time waiting for him, he never showed up. Mind you, this was the second mo show, one was for June 30th to take measurements. We waited all day then.When I called to ask what happened, he said he forgot. Very professional, right?I called the Lowes again where we made our purchase, I spoke to both the salesperson, and the manager of the store. They were both very nice and concerned. They did say again it had to be taken up with the install dept, and if installers did not make it right, that Lowes would.When I called them back they again told me they were waiting for the door professionals to get in touch with them.Good thing I did not hold my breathe, over 3 weeks later, still nothing.Once again, I decided to call them. This time I was told there was nothing I could do. They said if the door installer did not install my door, they could not be responsible. I asked to speak to manager to see how they could right this wrong, guess what, the call was disconnected!We are now here with one of our exit doors not able to open.After this review, I will be making a small claim naming the installer and Lowes.

So she said she would leave a message to a delivery in-charge person at my store to call me. The call didn't happen for more than 10 hours since I left the message. I didn't feel the sense of urgency. I was already several days behind the schedule. I think they are totally over-promising for what they can do. I cannot trust them especially the delivery date.

They wont even try to call someone to help, although very friendly, a very inconsistent level of customer service here. I can only assume the store manager is not pulling the management team together to share common goals.Products Available - I have been online many times looking to see if a specific product was in stock prior to driving to the store and 9 times out of 10 the website is wrong. Rarely can certain products be found in the store and when they are its very short lived.

Lowe's Companies,I was in lowes this week,I was in lowes this week. I discovered they are price gouging people. The prices are so high on things it crazy. Example electrical conduit pipe is three dollars higher a 10 foot stick than ace hardware in my town. When I asked to speak to a manager about this a customer service person told me the manager doesn't make the prices and walked away from me.,0,1

I called them to pick the set up. Now mine you i put this on my Lowes account. They told me I have to go to the store where it came from to get a cash refund. I told Lulu I do not live in that city i bought it online. Then she tells me to dispute the transaction It took forever for her to realize put the credit back on my card so can get something else. I feel so defeated today. Instead of you putting the credit on the card you want me to dispute the transaction.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Worst manner of customer care.,"I brought a mini fridge (Galanz 4.4cu ft mini retro frige ; color Blue $210 includes tax) last night through lowes.com and curbside pick it up this morning because that item was only available for store pick up. One hour after plug on it, there was icing on inside of refrigerator and I found out the rubber around of door was rumpled.I called to storeand talked with supervisor, her name: Virginia, (W Plano, Tx 75252 Lowes) for exchanging for the same item at the curbside parking lot, because I have a 2 years baby and can't carry that item by myself into the store. I am a second language of English speaker, I know my explanation probably slower than native speakers, I tried my best to explain my situation to her and she answered yes but had very bluntly and unkindly etitude. She also said she is very busy and gotta go to work while I am talking to her by phone. I am wondered I am a customer and my phone call to her was not her work? I spoke with her by phone about 10 minutes but waiting times was over 5 minutes. Anyway this afternoon (5hours from pick item up) I carried item back to the store curbside pick up zone.When I parked at the curbside pick up and called, the clerk, named Brandon who carried out exchanging item but it was opened box item has no wrapped, no protection supports only item was put into an empty box and he said they will not accept if I exchange or return that item again and Lowes accept only one time exchang or return with same item. I explained that I wanted to exchange because of its a defected item. He said, it was only stock of same item, and it was opened because they checked for rubber of door and inside and said will not accept exchange or return with same item. I complained and he said his supervisor said so to him then he called to supervisor whom I spoke with before name Virginia. She has very very bad etitude and very unkindly said she couldn't work because of my phone call, and couldn't accept if I bring same problem. I call my friend who speaks perfect English and she asked about the store policy to her and she changed her word and said store policy is acceptable 30 days exchange or return if only item has problem. ( when I checked the Lowes store policy she was't right its 90days acceptable of exchanging and returns.First of all, I don't understand why store supervisor doesn't know the store policy and has bad manner of customer care. I cannot said always but most of times I did my best to seek she / his understanding my lack of English and mostly people are understand and nice and kind. Today, experiencing of Lowes store is my worst customer service experience in USA.I am not really writing review person, but today I feel like I am treated by racism because of I am an Asian and can't speak only lack of English. It was first time experience of this kind matter. Finally, they didn't wrapping my exchanging fridge as well and just put it into my trunkOf course she didn't give me no apology for my experience.It was my first time and worst, horrible experience of customer care in the United States. Now I know why Lowes has lot of bad reviews on the sites.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,If I could give the Orem Lowes a zero…,"If I could give the Orem Lowes a zero rating I would! We bought a microwave and a dishwasher. We signed their contract to have them deliver and install the appliances. On the scheduled install day we didn't receive a call notifying us regarding an installation time so I called the store. When the installer didn't show up I called again only to be told they would call right back. Lowes never called but the installer called asking if we picked up the appliances my husband told him that the installer was supposed to pick up the appliances and install. The installer called us an hour later telling us that the store couldn't find our appliances. Landon from Lowes called my husband to try to fix the problem. I was also on the phone with Lowes trying to get a hold of the store manager instead I spoke to Elizabeth. Elizabeth lied said she would get the manager Aaron or Erin after she got more info from me. Needless to say she lied she never got the manager in fact she never intended to get the manager. Elizabeth had attitude while trying to ""diffuse"" the situation which only made things worse. Eventually the appliances were delivered and the dishwasher was broken. Landon found us another dishwasher. My advice to corporate make Landon in flooring and installation the store manager.

Lowe's Companies,Batting 1 for 3 and that is generous,"This is the worst experience EVER when buying an appliance. I have been dealing with Lowes for a little over two months now and it has gotten so bad, I am not even surprised at their utter and complete failure at every turn.I ordered three appliances online, and out of the three, one turned out the way it should (almost). I can understand shipping delays due to COVID, but this is not even that. They LOST my stovetop, they didn't deliver my microwave because they couldn't figure out how to get it on a trunk and get it to my house (it was at the store for a week before I got fed up and went to pick it up). Finally, the oven needed to be returned because it had a warped frame. I tried to exchange it, they said I had to buy another one and then do a return. I put the order in at the store, then their online department said the oven wasn't offered online anymore. I tried to schedule a pickup of the old oven, they put the address in wrong and called during the window they were supposed to pick and said they couldn't come. This is not one employee; the Customer Service department, the store manager, appliance specialist, delivery guys, online personnel. I have dealt with at least a dozen Lowes employees, and it was a trial-by-fire to get this far. Unless you feel like wasting alot of time and money, go somewhere else, ANYWHERE else.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes online ordering system is broken,"Lowes online ordering system is in a shambles. You can see numerous complaints on the BBB web site. Lowe’s takes online orders which it cannot fulfill. Lowe’s either knows it cannot fulfill these orders at the time they are made, or lacks adequate controls which prevents it from knowing. The executive office reasons that an online disclosure absolves it of all responsibility to complete customer orders, and places any and all blame on vendor(s).

I was told I needed to call each store individually to cancel my order. I did and was assured the items were cancelled. I even received an email confirmation on July 28th. I began to receive calls from the Bessemer location telling me the items were out of stock. I told them 2 different times the items were cancelled and that I did want to be charged for the items. One August 10 I was charged $231.08 for the items and I called the corporate office and was told that they would be cancelled again. I then received a phone call on August 13th from a Lowes Delivery driver telling me that the items where on the way. I told him that I did not want the items and he began to argue with me and insisted on bringing them. I told him I had cancelled the items. He said okay and then later that afternoon I received an email saying the items had been delivered. I called the customer service line again and was told the items would be cancelled and I would receive a refund. 28 days went by and I realized I had not received the refund. I called the customer service number on 9/9/2020 after a 30 minutes conversation with T. Kathy I was told I had to call the Bessemer store to get the refund. I called and was repeatedly hung up on and then told to come up to the store. I called the customer service number again and spoke with a man named A.J. he was very helpful and told me he would have the Bessemer store manager call me. A man named Jimmy Johnson then have me a call and got my information. He told me he would look over paperwork and then call me back. I don't understand why I can't get a refund for an online order that was cancelled. I cancelled the order in under 30 days after placing the order.

Lowe's Companies,Frustrated Customer,"I bought today 4 gallons of a Sherwin-Williams paint that, according to Lowes in store advertisement, had a rebate of $5 per each gallon, due to Labor Day offers.

Then I asked if with my receipt I had enough information as to submit the request for rebate, and once again, she had no clue. Then I asked to talk to the Manager of the store located in Winchester, TN and when he arrived, once again he had no clue about the rebate. He went over the paint area and came back with the same explanation: I had to go online and place my request for rebate, and once again, I asked if the information in my receipt was enough as to complete the petition on line and he answered ""YES"". The offer expires today and after a long day at work, when I got home and tried to submit my request, I found out in Lowes Website that I needed information provided in a ""Rebate Receipt"", which, by the way, was never given to me! So I drove to the closest Lowes and the Manager said they could not give me the Rebate Receipt that was supposed to be provided by the store where I purchased the paint.

Lowe's Companies,POOR SAFETY CONCERNS Lowes Port Arthur,"I was in Lowes Port Arthur, TX Saturday morning (9/5/20) with a buggy full of materials. When I walked up to the register with the buggy, I went around to unload it for the cashier and slipped in a puddle of oil on the concrete floor. During the fall I thought that I broke my leg by the way it twisted. I heard a few people asking if I was OK. I got up and seen that no one was attempting to clean it up so I asked the cashier to get someone and she told me that someone will get to it that it was on camera. She did not call anyone so I told an associate that was working next to her and he told me that he didn't see a problem. I told him that I just fell and almost broke my leg and he say's that it's not his concern. I yelled out to get me a manager and that I wanted him fired. I had to ask three times for them to call a manager before they called for one. The manager comes up and I tell him the story and all he does is tell me that they will handle it. We get a little loud and he tells me that it's not a big deal. I tell him that it is a big deal because I slipped down and almost broke my leg and he says it again, it's being taken care and walks off. Never asked if I was OK or as for as I know, went look at the video. I leave the store with no assistance to load up $900.00 worth of materials or any concern from any associate. Lowes seems not to have any concern for their customer safety or well being. While loading the materials in my truck, my elbow and knee start hurting and by the time I get home 30 minutes later my head is pounding with a bad headache so I decide to call customer service. After a 20 minute wait for someone to answer my call, the gentleman was very nice an corporate. After a hour and a half phone call telling him my concerns and demands about Lowes safety policies, he tells me that the store would contact me within 48 hours to discuss the incident. He also told me to go to the ER to get checked out. ER Diagnostics came back that nothing is broken but if pain continues to go get an MRI. Evidently, Lowes does not take this serious because no one contacted me. By Saturday night I had a sore back and my ankle was killing me. If this is how Lowes handles their business, I believe that I will be shopping elsewhere",0,1

Potting soil is not cheap. I now have all my plants in my backyard sitting in buckets of water. I'm hoping to disinfect my home as much as I can and I pray that when I finally repot these plants and bring them back inside the infestation is gone I am so disappointed I'm bummed out because I bought a lot of those plans for 14 to $16 a piece and many of them are gone now. To Lowes this is a huge problem you guys need to make sure that your plants aren't infested with these bugs I mean there are tens of them in the dirt of the plants plus the eggs you should be treating these plants and it can be done because home depot's plants aren't infested damn.",0,1

Upon walking around for five minutes we noticed the customer service line was out the door two employees were stocking not helping customers, so I approached a worker and asked for assistance to find a specific toilet seat. He wouldn't help and paged for someone else to do it. We waited ten minutes in the plumbing section and no one came then some lady tells all employees to go to the front of the store to have a meeting all the while there was at least 20 customers in the place not being attended to. After 15 to 20 minutes of no help we went across the street to Home Depot where we were greeted immediately, had three employees help us find what we were looking for and purchased all three items. If you need anything definitely go to Home Depot their customer service is impeccable. Lowe's has definitely lost customers.",0,1

Which I had to call and take an appt for!!!!

Lowe's Companies,One of the worst customer service…,One of the worst customer service departments I've dealt with. Ordered item with damaged part. Gave customer service a call several times and each time they had to transfer to multiple departments. Additional afterwards told me I had to contact the vendor for the replacement part number. Called the vendor and they had to call Lowe's several times to get the item part number for the replaced part. Whole process has taken about 3 months now. Vendor told me they spoke with Lowe's and part can be picked up at specified store. Spoke with Lowe's prior to pickup and representative says part was not there yet. Called the day afterwards and another representative said that is not how things work where they need send replacement part to store for customer pickup. Part should be sent to owner's home. Been quite a headache. They really need to look at their process flow and streamline it and training for all their representatives. They apparently don't know what is their protocol to follow and seriously has been wasting my time and theirs going back and forth.,0,1

There is never anyone to help you and you can spend 1/2 the day waiting to get help. Yesterday was the last straw...I purchased wall to wall carpeting for my entire home. The carpet and install were great BUT leave it to Lowes to screw it up! I had set a high payment monthly ( Auto pay) thru the Lowes credit card and plan to pay off the carpet in 3 months. 4 days after the carpet went in auto pay withdrew the entire amount from my bank! It left me with $28 in my checking account for the entire month! I chatted with customer service and they told me it was ""your banks fault"" WHAT??? I called and talked to a manager and requested an explaination her reply was ""I am sorry there must have been a glitch in the system! I have given you a $30 credit on your Lowes credit card, REALLY? I ask her if she could send back a partial amount and she said of course in 7 days.....I will never deal with Lowes again, Jerrys Home Improvement and Home Depot here I come for the rest of my remodel.

Lowe's Companies,It's safer to buy seafood out of a hot car in July than spend a dime with Lowes in Longview TX. The sales rep Chris McDonald stole the material I prepaid for after I fired him for being incompetent!!,"My wife recently called Lowes In Longview Texas 75605 and asked for a quote on installing app 400'of 5' chain link fence on our property. Lowes sent a sales representative by the name of Chris McDonald out to give us an estimate for the work to be performed we marked the area with red paint which is still on the ground unless the rain washed it away. Two guys showed on Friday 8-28 and returned on Monday 8-31-20 in 2 days Mutt and Jeff were able to install 18 fence post (in the wrong place and 2 gate post in the wrong place). The installation crew (Mutt and Jeff) decided to move the fence app 3 feet further from the highway than what we agreed on. Basically I wanted my fence built on my property line across the front yard and by moving the fence I would basically be paying to install a fence 3 feet off of my property line causing us to lose 3 feet of our front yard. I told Mutt and Jeff to hit the road and take their TOOLS with them. My wife paid 1,500.00 dollars in cash and put the remaining 3,750.00 dollars on a Lowes credit card because of a low introductory interest rate. We called Lowes and told them to stop all work and they would be responsible for pulling the fence post up and we expected a full refund. The sales representative CHRIS MCDONALD claims that we had agreed to pay them 5,250 dollars for 165 feet of fence and a gate and that is not the case at all. The manager of the store called me today and told me they were going to refund a total of 1,600.00 dollars out of the 5,250.00 that we prepaid them. they are trying to charge us for material that isn't here and if it ever was here Mutt and Jeff or their goofy leader CHRIS MCDONALD took it with them when they left. I went to the store this afternoon and met with a manager by the name of Ryan that bears all resemblance of a fat cartoon character like CHRIS MCDONALD. I accepted the 1,600.00 that RYAN the fat cartoon character gave me and then called the Lowes credit card company and they are working on a resolution. I got an estimate on removing the post and repairing the damage to my yard for 2,000.00 dollars and I'm pretty sure Lowes of Longview will be paying for that. I will be needing someone to install the fence correctly. I will not use anyone that purchases material from Lowes in Longview in fact I will get the material myself and pay cash money for the labor. I will not use any one associated with the two fat cartoon characters CHRIS MCDONALD OR THE GOOFY NIGHT MANAGER THATS WORKING TONIGHT BY THE NAME OF BRYAN. You don't always have to take what people try to give you. To thine own self be true. But I would advise anyone looking to use Lowes in Longview Texas for any of your projects to STAY AWAY from these goofy little feminine salesman and managers like CHRIS MCDONALD OR THE MANAGER WORKING TONIGHT RYAN neither of these guys know their job and Lowes would be better off standing them in a corner so people could stick gum on them. These guys are so goofy they are almost comical. lol",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Not the best place to buy appliances,"I purchased a dishwasher from Lowes. This has been my worst online transaction ever! They offer haul away service during the purchase (at a price of $30) but do not specify that the old device has to be unhooked so the person delivering the new device can haul away the old one. They also sell the hose and power cord separately (at an additional cost) but ship from different places so the connectors will not arrive on time for installation, so you need to pay for them again during installation and request a credit for the original one. Requesting a credit for products/services not rendered (2 out of 3) takes at least 45 minutes waiting in line and 15 more minutes while the representative completes the transaction. Do yourself a favor: buy somewhere else.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Deceptive/ misleading customers,I only put 2 stars instead of 1 star because of past issues that were resolved satisfactory. Ordered appliance online it emailed me it would be ready on the 3rd. got there on the 4th and no appliance. Why tell someone it will be there when its not. Went to the customer service pick up desk they went to get my pre-purchased appliance they sent a guy back to get it. since it would take a while i asked to do some shopping while i waited they said they would page me when it made it upfront. i shopped and bought some items and wandered around the store waiting for my page. It never came I finally went to the front again and the counter person realized they failed to page me. I did not see my appliance anywhere. The counter person went to the end of the customer service area to speak with someone (supervisor) then came to me to inform they did not have my order that they would let me know when it got in. Suspecting deception I asked when i could expect a call..NEXT MONTH?? 30 days out. Why not be upfront why waste my time. No consideration for customers time and supervisor hid from conflict making subordinate do the dirty work of misleading a customer.,0,2

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's does not back their merchandise - even with an extended warranty,"Two years ago I purchased an LG high end refrigerator. And per the salesman's recommendations I also purchased Lowe's extended warranty. The night before last the refrigerator died - no cooling or freezing. I called Lowe's repair service and they claimed they couldn't get here for a month and a half. When I pointed out that if they couldn't fix it in 7 days, they needed to give me a reimbursement. All of a sudden they found a repair date of 5 days down the road. Have you ever tried to live for almost a week out of an ice chest? I was bumped up to a ""supervisor"" who claimed she could do nothing for me. Moral of this story: DO NOT PURCHASE FROM LOWE'S!! DEFINITELY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON AN EXTENDED WARRANTY!! Had I not purchased the extended warranty I would have had a $300.00 deduction on the next refrigerator I have to buy. Had I not purchased the extended warranty I would have purchased a new refrigerator yesterday and I would be in great shape today. I even explained to them I was a transplant patient with no immune system and every time I go out to buy ice I am exposing myself to COVID which my body has no way of fighting.

Credit card company immediately reversed the charge. At the time I also purchased 2 doors. My mistake - wrong size. As they still sell these same doors I thought they would take them back with a receipt. No, go to another dept and talk with them, and then wait 30 minutes for another person to get back from lunch. Then she smiled and said even if she did take them back she would charge me a 20% restocking fee because of Covid. I explained that was only for special orders which it was not, it is a wax(?) order (online for items not kept in stock). And Covid should have nothing to do with Lowes greediness, but less customer service is their game now since more people are staying home and updating.

Lowe's Companies,I attempted to return a black and…,"I attempted to return a black and decker cordless circular saw, that was purchased by my son for his dad as a birthday gift, at the Hamilton Ohio store. I did not have receipt due to it was a gift, and planned on purchasing a DeWalt for $129 compared to the B&D $45 for the simple reason that my husband already has DeWalt tools and batteries are interchangeable. The price on Lowe's.com was $45.64. The ""kid"" Maxwell whom worked at the customer service desk would not give me in-store credit for that amount because it rang up $29 and some change. I showed him the price on the internet and he continued to say he would not honor that price because that is not what comes up when he scans it. I also asked him if it was now on sale, and he said no. Then Maxwell calls one manager and they must've told him to call another manager. So Maxwell calls another manager and they say that price must've been through a different store and we can not honor that. *Note* online says it is not available online and can only purchase in store. So Maxwell wants to continue to argue that this item is not available online. I point out that it says that online so obviously the price listed would be the in store price. Maxwell still continues to not understand nor honor online price, so I tell him I am going to go get DeWalt saw and check price on B&D and I will be back. I could not find the B&D but picked up DeWalt and headed back to customer service desk. I also made sure location for Lowe's.com was on Hamilton Ohio and the price was still 45.64. When I got back to customer service desk and advised Maxwell that the B&D saw was out but showed him my phone that the location for the $45.64 was on Hamilton Ohio and asked to speak to a manager, Maxwell became very angry stating ""I told you lady what the price is for the return"" along with a few other comments and refused to get a manager. I again requested a manager and told him he is not going to talk to me like that. Maxwell again very rudely replied the price he is going to do the return for along with other snide remarks and refused again to get a manager. By now I am furious and raised my voice for other customers to hear, sat down the drill in a loud manner, and demanded a manager. Manager Joe then comes to the desk and Maxwell starts again and in his loud snide voice yells ""don't slam our merchandise MAMM"" with even more emphasis on mamm. So now Joe the manager has a chip on his shoulder automatically because he thinks I am slamming merchandise on the counter. Now I am already on the defensive and upset because of what i just endured with Maxwell and how he talked to me, and now Joe also will not honor price online that is approximately a $15 difference to go towards the $129 saw. So I ask Joe for cooperate number and call them while standing in front of service desk the whole time. So now I have spent at least 40 minutes in store before calling cooperate number, which was another 30 minutes, and while on hold I made it a point to advise customers walking in the door to check online prices also because they differ and the store will not honor. After approximately 45 minutes into this I also realize Maxwell did not give me my license back, which was given to him before I went to get DeWalt saw, I say something to Joe and my license is laying unattended standing up against the computer screen for 45 minutes. How irresponsible. So I am even more aggravated by this and tell a customer walking in the door they may want to go to home depot or Menards to shop and Joe threatens me to call the cops if I do not stop saying things to customers. I inform him that it is ""free speech"" and he says no it's slander. I then informed him he needs to look up the definition of slander because advising someone to shop elsewhere is not slander. Now back to phone call with cooperate. The lady on the phone advises me that the price online was an error on their part and the $29 and some change price was the sale price and should not be $45.64 so therefore that is the price they can honor. So I advised the lady on the phone and Joe that I will wait until the sale is over to return and I will NOT purchase anything else from Lowe's due to the poor customer service especially from Maxwell. Joe then said he could take half off the price of the DeWalt saw, but could only return the B&D for the sale price. So all of this for a $15 dollar difference in the return when I was spending more money on the DeWalt in store at $129, the sales associate Maxwell treated me horrible and talked to me horrible, the hour and a half I spent of my time at the store and on the phone, for the manager Joe to say as I am packing up the B&D saw to leave ""I will give you discount of 1/2 off the new drill but can only do the $29 for the B&D. Soo $129 DeWalt saw was rang up for $64, $31.11 taken off for B&D return, and $129 DeWalt drill costed me out of pocket $30. Now does this make any sense to you. SMH.",0,1

Then I had to cancel it & ask them to take the partial order back. Then call again to do the refund ! I have summarized the experience in 3 sentences, but I should mention that for every step , I had to make several calls with looong hold times ! Sometimes I was lucky in that I could leave my number for a call back. However that happended may be like 2 times out of the 15 calls I had to make !!!Adding an update on 09/14/2020. Made a trip to the store to get a refund as the online customer rep suggested that since the local store picked up the returned order, I need to check with them. The person in the store took the details & never returned my call ! So, I disputed the charges with my credit card company ! Not sure, when will get a refund ! sigh !",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Wetumpka Lowe's Poor Customer Service,"I gave Wetumpka, AL Lowe's a 5 rating when I bought my Weber Grill. It was a floor model already assembled as they did not have any others. It was going to take 2 weeks! to deliver. What was delivered was a box, unassembled grill. The delivery ""boss's Boss"" said someone would be out in 24 hours to either assemble or bring a grill already assembled when I refused the delivery. No one came. She lied, the store told her a lie. I called the Wetumpka store Customer service who said I could return the box and purchase an assembled one. Never mind that I got a discount for first time using my Lowe's card and a $50 gift certificate and that I am 73 years old and cannot pick up the boxed grill. The Customer Service should get a ZERO STARS. No making it right. I even called and talked with my sales person, Jason Taylor, who verified that I bought the assembled floor model and he took it to the back with my name on it. Somewhere, someone decided not to honor my purchase of the assembled floor model. The box sits on my patio with a tarp over it. I cannot pick up, move or put together this very heavy grill. So it sits. For Lowe's and their poor, no integrity customer service, I only feel deep disappointment and disgust. Do not buy anything at Lowe's that you cannot take home yourself as what they deliver may not be what you actually bought. And they will not make it right.",0,1

Latest is shipping, they show order to be ""in transit"", UPS said it should have been here days ago. Cancel my order, NO sir can't do that it's in transit. Ok tell me where it is, you will have to call UPS sir. Yeah ok, round and round we go. It must have gotten lost in transit, let me work on that, oh I see it's to be delivered in 3 days. 3 days from when I ordered over a week ago. Please cancel my order, no sir can't do that it's still on transit. HD and Lowe's have consistently went up in sales and down in customer satisfaction. Wake up everyone let's shoot at ACE where customer service is still a quality believed in. They consistently beat HD and Lowe's year after year.

How unfair is that? I should be refunded immediately. I have proof of canceling this order before they said they delivered. Lowes has the proof but I have to wait.CROOKS.... I even reached out to the President / CEO. Nothing !!! No response. Unbelievable!!!I have never even been in the Kathleen Ga store. I initially placed the order in Warner Robins Georgia and they sent the order to the Kathleen location. When I found out how long it would take, I went back to WR and purchased the floor model and canceled the online order. I even told the delivery guy, when he called me on August 1st and then again the 7th, that this order had been canceled.It was August 3rd when I was about to pay my bill online that I noticed my card had been charged for something I cancelled. That day, I contacted Lowes and filed a complaint. They emailed me a complaint number, that has been of no value..

Lowe's Companies,Bad service to a good long time customer,"I went to Lowe’s Hattiesburg today 8/27 to pay my bill and get help signing up for the veterans discount. I was paying the full amount of the statement, $175.00 I received this month as I do every month. The customer service lady took the bill and check, scanned statement and told me I owed $225. I told her I was paying my monthly statement which she had in her hand. She said that was not the amount on the account. I asked for the manager and a young African American man came and asked what was my problem, I explained again and he said the $225 was what the computer showed. I said the difference is probably what we charged since the statement was sent but no one was hearing it. He said he would be happy to give me a receipt for the $175. I asked if he could help me sign up for my veterans discount, I had my VIC card. He said to do it on line. I explained I had tried but it kept wanting me to open new account and I just wanted it added to my existing account. He said there was nothing he could do. I had to do it on line. We have done business with this store for over 28 years including a commercial account but in the last 3-5 the service has gotten worse and worse and at times even rude and non existent.

Lowe's Companies,Save Yourself - Cross the Street to Home Depot,"Don't waste your precious time at the Lowe's on IH-35 near Connelly High School (Store #1725 NE Austin). ONE star for my visit to their store yesterday - and only bc I can't post the review unless I choose at least one star. Arrived at lunch hoping to pick up landscaping supplies within the hour and what a disappointment! Asked Amber in patio where I could find their usual stock of Scott's Lawn Soil and she proceeds to point to the side of the patio area replying ""we have all kinds of soil over there"". I explain I'm looking for specific brand/use soil and she rudely shoves her phone at me through the plexiglass asking me to type in what I'm looking for on her phone's Lowe's app. DURING A PANDEMIC WHERE WE ARE SEPARATED BY PLEXIGLASS AT THE CHECKOUT, SHE'S SHOVES HER PHONE AT ME!!?? I tell her I'm not going to touch her phone and asked that she page someone since she clearly has ZERO knowledge in her own work area. Shameless. She pages someone not once, not twice but 3 times and no one shows up. I find the palette way up in the rafters and let Amber know but she just absently blinks at me like a deer in headlights on how to access the soil, still unable to raise anyone for assistance. I've never EVER had such poor service at what WAS once a generally decent Lowe's store so I decide someone should know about the experience. Not to give me any type of special treatment but to be aware of what's happening in their store to make improvements. Maybe even relocate Amber to lightbulbs or something less taxing for her to manage. Next up, Tommy (MOD) shows up at Customer Service following my request to speak to the manager. What shows up before me is some random that looks like he just finished a pub-crawl. No semblance whatsoever that he represented Lowe's much less in a managerial capacity. I felt like I was talking to the local frat boy. Lord. I started to tell him what happened but his whole demeanor wreaked of ""I have better things to do"" so I wrapped it up with an expletive and told him I was taking my business across the street to the better home improvement store aka Home Depot and you know what, their patio staff knew EXACTLY what Lawn Soil was and within 10 minutes I was in and out with what I needed. They also mentioned they get people over there all the time with similar stories of that same Lowe's location. Amber and Tommy, thanks for the great reminder that better service, product knowledge, and staff are just across the street. Will no longer be wasting my time at your place.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Disregard of consumer warranties.,"I recently purchased an outdoor fence with installation from Lowe's. The installer did not receive necessary product to secure my gate & left with a string around the top to open & close it. It was not addressed the following Mon as he said & we had a bad storm where the gate was blown back & forth & it caused damage to the fence it was attached to. It buckled. Lowe's refuses to take responsibility & I have been advised by their complaints dept that it was the storms fault. No responsibility on their part. This was a $6,000 fence that was supposedly warrantied for lifetime with warranty/guarantee on installation for 1 year. This happened within a few weeks of their incomplete install. Beware. That's what I'm saying. I chose Lowe's because of decades of great customer service. Apparently they have changed their minds about valuing customer's if it costs them money. I am more than disappointed & grieved that I now have no where to go that I can trust people. I certainly won't be shopping there again for ANYTHING.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Don't buy from lowes, they don't deserve your money","Hey, do not shop at lowes. I just bought a dishwasher with all the bells and whistles online including delivery, installation, and the haul away service. The expected delivery was on 08-24 and some guy from a third party company plops it in the middle of our living room and leaves. I don't know what is going on at this point. So I then call the fulfilling center in which I get transferred three times to a dead line. Next I call the customer care line in which I wait 45 minutes before someone answers and I tell them this and they said installation will happen at some point this week. I told her I have a dishwasher in my living room, we have no communication with anyone on anything and she basically told me it is the way things are done. I did not find that satisfactory so I called the store, which was a nightmare. I had to go through the phone menu several different times just to get someone who would answer and immediately asked for a manager. I finally got one after waiting for 20 minutes. She said that she would talk to installation and they would call me next day. That is today and no call, I decided to call the customer care line again and had to wait a while again. I asked for a manager again immediately and she said she could not directly escalate. So I explained my situation and she told me I was impatient. It is not a matter of impatience, it is a matter of communication. I understand that times are really weird now with covid and I am more then willing to wait, but I was not told anything from purchasing the dishwasher til I got it about their process. I have now requested a refund and to get the dishwasher removed. I am taking my business elsewhere and I suggest everyone else does so as well.

Lowe's Companies,Customer Service is Non-Existent,"In early July, our dishwasher died. After searching several other stores for a new one, we decided to try Lowes. Everyone was out of stock in the color we wanted, and telling us they were back-ordered until mid-August due to manufacturing being shut down earlier in the year for the pandemic. Lo and behold, Lowes could have one in, and get us the desired color, by July 25. So we made the purchase. Days later they called to tell us it was now back-ordered until August 10. Not great, but understandable. August 10 came and went. Nothing. I called several times and got no response from either the appliance department or the delivery department--the phone just rang non stop, no one ever picked up. I ended calling an 800 number I got from a chatbot online and after about 90 minutes of being bounced around, got someone who seemed helpful (at least at the time). She told me my dishwasher was in a distribution center in Albuquerque and would be shipped to my store in Greece NY by the end of the week.Guess what? Another week went by and still nothing. This time when I called the store, I got an answer in the appliance department. ""Cheryl"" barely let me get a word in edgewise she was so busy talking over me and interrupting me. She was beyond rude--just plain nasty, clearly there is no customer service training here (I say that as someone who has worked customer service jobs for the last 35 years, about 18 of them in retail). At this point, I had been handwashing dishes for a family of four (including two teenaged boys who eat a lot) for six weeks so if anyone has the right to be nasty, it was me. But she used the old line ""they're unloading a truck now, maybe your appliance is on it"" and said she'd call and let me know either way. Well, as you can probably guess, she never did.A few hours later I called back the number I'd had luck with the week before. This time the lady I got said she didn't know where my dishwasher was but she would check with the store. Then I got a call from Cheryl again (strangely a bit nicer this time since I'd told the other lady how rude she was) telling me the dishwasher is back-ordered until October. Long story short I canceled the order. If I am going to wait a while, I'd rather work with a company that at least has the courtesy to keep me updated. My issue was never the delay, it was the fact that no one bothered to call and let me know it had been delayed again or when I could expect it to come in. From reading other reviews online just now, I see this is a pretty regular thing with Lowes. I ended up going to my locally owned appliance store and purchasing a dishwasher in a different color (and you know what? I like the change). It has already been delivered. Sure I paid a little more but it was worth it. So here is my suggestion: support your local seller instead. They appreciate the business and will treat you accordingly.",0,1

I went to the store on Friday after 10 am. I was told that the items were not here as of yet, the delivery will be Friday night not during the day. This was not told to me when I made the purchase.I call the next day at 7:30 am before going to the store and was told the items were not delivered. I said to the associate I was told that a truck was delivering the items last night. She said shipment came in but my items were not on the truck, and that she will have the associate in that department call me when she comes in at 8 am. I waited until 8:30 am, no one calls me. I called back again the associate told me that she gave my information to (Amanda) the associate in the department where the items are from and she will remind her to call me. As of 9.30 am I still haven't received a call from anyone at Lowe's. I called back a third time; this time I was told there is no guarantee that that the items will be on the truck when it delivers. On top of that the lady was asking me the same thing over and over again as if i was ignorant to what was going on. I asked to speak to a manager and she put me on hold. I waited for approximately 20 minutes and no one came to the phone so I hang up.I called back a fourth time and asked for a manager, a male came to the phone and said his name was Jose. I explained to him what was going on and he told me to hold on. He came back to the phone and said that my order will be in the store on Monday, August 24,2020, and will be ready for pick up the next day. I said to him when I made the purchase I was told it will be in the store by Friday and I mentioned to the associate that I will pick them up by Monday and now you are telling me a completely different story. He replied you asked me for a date and that is what I am giving you. I said to him why was I told on thing and now I being told something else. He said again you asked for a date and that is what I am giving you. He was not trying to understand or even trying to listen to my complaint, so I hang up the phone.These people don't care about their customers; they provide you with false information and become rude when you questioned them.

Called customer service and received an incident number and was told a week ago the carpet that was missing from the order would be sent out immediately. No carpet yet. My carpets were $28 per carpet with a total order in the amount of $91.29. I called the same number tonight (18004456937) to find out where my third carpet is. Was on hold 22 mins waiting to speak with someone and the line switched me over to a survey to rate the service I just got on my call. SMH. So of course I rated all zeros, the lowest rating. Hey Lowes, where's the third carpet I paid for weeks ago????",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Where are my cabinets?,"Wow, I should have read these reviews first, prior to spending over $2,000 a month ago. Ordered cabinets one month ago. Understood the delivery would take longer, sure no problem. My receipt said 8/20/2020 for delivery. I call 8/19/2020 directly to the department that sold me the cabinets. Confirmed its packed and ready for delivery. I'd get a call the morning of to set time.Wow! I received my call. Only to be told, ""We are not delivering your cabinets my delivery driver called in."" Ummm What? Seriously? I get it, things happen but you base your day of ""function"" on ONE delivery driver? I took time off work to be here for your damn delivery. I called back..yeah good luck...NO ONE ANSWERS THE DELIVERY LINE. So I call my contact in the cabinet area, she's frustrated as well. Reassures me a manager will call me. I received a call from manager named Megan who had every excuse in the book. I was reassured my cabinets would arrive today, 8/21/2020. I've called the delivery department ALL DAY to figure out a time frame or an additional confirmation for my delivery since I no longer trust this company. No answer. Its now 4:06pm...who wants to bet my cabinets WILL NOT show up today? I am beyond furious, upset, drained and down right pissed off with the lack of any customer service with this company.

Got home and realized this and had to make a 16-mile round trip to make it good. Again, they did not answer the phone when we arrived. Sat another 20 minutes even though they were aware of our return trip.

Lowe's Companies,I purchased a Samsung washer and dryer…,"I purchased a Samsung washer and dryer set from LOWES over a month ago. I was told that I would have delivery updates within a couple days and that my washer and dryer set would be delivered within the week, so I got rid of my older set. A week later I didn’t hear back so I called, and kept getting sent to the appliance center, where all in all, was on hold for another hour. I was then told that they no longer had my dryer but that they would update me when they did. I called and sat on hold for the next 2 weeks in which they told me contradicting statements each time. They have it, they don’t, they will, they wont, etc. After weeks, they told me that my washer and dryer set would finally be delivered on 8/1/2020. I was very happy to hear this but on the first, they delivered my washer, washer hook ups, dryer hook ups but NO DRYER! Again I spent too much time calling and being put on hold until one sales associate finally helped me. Turns out, they sold me a dryer that is discontinued. I left a review about my experience on an instagram post where I was asked to call a phone number so that they could assist me. I was then told it would take an additional 3 weeks for any additional information updates but that the store would exchange or compensate me for my trouble and bad experience with them(Still waiting on that). They offered to exchange but only offered they’re worst quality set which wasn’t even comparable nor was it Samsung. I told them I wanted a similar set to the one I bought(same brand, same capacity), weeks later, I still haven’t heard back. They still have yet to offer me any compensation for all of this either. I am going to be waiting for 2 months to see if they will give me the dryer I bought, and that they charged to my card. I wish I would have never bought this set from them, if the money they charged were in my investment portfolio, it would’ve nearly doubled, instead its a sitting in the Lowes bank account and yet I have no dryer still or word on if I ever will. I will NOT be buying anything from “Low’s” ever again. The constant back and fourth, unwillingness to sort out my order, they have held onto my money for 6 weeks on a purchase they have yet to deliver, lack of customer support, and sitting on hold for an hour only to be told they cannot provide any information about where my order is. Do yourself a favor and buy from somewhere more reputable, Home Depot, Jerrys, Best Buy, anywhere but Lowes. Until then, I will have to wait for 2 months until they can even tell me if they will give me what I bought from them, 2 months just for a response. So I am using my washer which was delivered late and hang drying my clothes, waiting in limbo for a dryer...",0,1

I went to customer service as CSR said that's where I could speak with someone and pay for purchase. I spoke with gentleman who I thought was manager and was told same thing about sale items not getting military discount. I called 1-800-445-6937 and spoke with nice lady Asia and she said same thing about sale items not getting military discount.

Lowe's Companies,Signed contract and they disappeared; work half finished,"Two months ago, I signed a contract to have Lowe's install a fence and I have regretted it ever since. Here is a list of the issues Lowe's is causing so far:1. A month ago, the sales representative had disappeared since I signed the contract and would not reply to any emails or calls. I then went in to the local store to get an update and they said to reach out to my sales rep even though my issue was that the sales rep would not reply to me. I was finally able to get a manager who said that they would reach out to my sales rep and let him know that I have been trying to contact him. 2. The sales representative wrote a false phone number on the contract and that is the phone number I was trying to call for 2 weeks. Once I got the correct number, he still would not answer.3. Delivery was scheduled for last Tuesday for the building materials. I confirmed the delivery and waited at home for a few hours only to receive a phone call that the product hadn't been sent to the store yet (not sure why they couldn't tell me this sooner so that I didn't have to take time off from work). I was told my sales representative would reach out to me shortly.4. After never being contacted by my sales representative, I have now been trying to contact him for a week, once again not getting any replies.I am to this day wondering where my fence is even though I have been charged thousands of dollars and am now required to pay, even without knowing if the fence will ever be installed. All I want is an update on my fence but nobody at Lowe's is able to do that.____________________________________________UPDATE:It is now two weeks later and I still have not heard from the sales rep. I am now just going to pretend this guy doesn't exist and will just contact corporate from now on.However, today Lowe's was supposed to deliver the product again, and for the second time, they did not show up. They are supposed to have everything installed by 9/19, but the product isn't delivered yet and the contractor isn't scheduled so this doesn't appear that it will happen. I will more than likely cancel the contract after they breach it after the 19th.__________________________________2ND UPDATE:Lowe's did not schedule an installation date with me but I received a surprise call 2 days before the contract expired that they were coming to install the fence on Saturday. I finally thought this would be the end of it, but I was wrong. When the contractors were ready to leave, they informed me that Lowe's did not deliver all of the product to complete the fence. I asked them what I am supposed to do now and they said it was between me and Lowe's since it was Lowe's mistake. They said that they would call it in and report it to Lowe's, but I also called and reported it that same day. I waited two weeks for an answer from them and decided to give them a call for an update. I then found out that they were not aware that the product was missing. The representative sounded confused and asked to put me on hold. The representative never returned after placing me on hold. I was now informed by a friend that the best action is to get a lawyer and take them to court since they do not listen otherwise. AVOID LOWE'S AT ALL COSTS!!!______________________________________3RD UPDATE:A few days ago as I was writing the above update, I was on hold forever with Lowe's, trying to get an answer as to when they would finish the fence. After the associate got back on the phone, she said ""what are you calling about again?"" to which I replied ""the completion of my fence"". She then hung up the phone. At this point, I was beyond livid. I called back and was on the phone with a different representative and told them that I was just hung up on by one of their associates. She reported this to her supervisor and gave me 2 numbers to call for further assistance (this is the most help I have gotten from someone at Lowe's but she apologized for not being able to help more because Lowe's does not allow her to see the full information about the fence project). I called the first number... no help. I called the second number and spoke to Kimberly who seemed to have all of the knowledge about my fence, but she did not seem to want to be on the phone or working that day. She understood all of the issues that I was having and assured me that the rest of the product to build the remainder of the fence would be delivered the next day. However, the next day came and no delivery came nor did I receive a phone call. I have never had to hire an attorney before, but I am now at the finishing stages of hiring one because of Lowe's.",0,1

Our order has been a headache since we ordered back in November 2019! Didn't find out until day before expected delivery that all our appliances, except vacuum, was on backorder till February. Called rebate center since we couldn't send in our rebate until we had the receipt from delivery. They told us it was no problem and to send it to a different address since it was a special case. The guy knew right away to find this address. Appliances get delivered, I send in our rebates. Few weeks pass and we got the smaller ones of $150, $100 for our washer and dryer. Few more weeks pass still nothing on our $700 rebate. I try calling but of course everything has been closed. We keep trying to call every so often until they open back up. Then we end up in a loop of click this number, you need to be redirected, oh actually you need to go back to the previous department, and repeat. Finally talked with store associate who went above and beyond in trying to help us with the rebate and staying in touch with is. He finally tells us that all rebates previously turned in have been lost. We end up talking with a call center about resubmitting our rebate, with proof of rebate and purchase for them to tell us the rebate is too old now and they won't honor it. This has only been a review on their rebate system, I have at least three other stories on their customer service, installation and delivery. I've had problems both in and out of the store.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,I'll never have a Lowe's delivery again!,"We ordered an electric cooktop and a range hood exhaust on July 17. Our salesman ordered our appliances and gave us a delivery date of Aug 2. Someone would call with a delivery time. By 5pm on Aug 2, no one had called us.(1) After spending 20 minutes on hold we were told our cooktop hadn't arrived at the distribution center. We were told it may take up to 2 weeks. After my mini irate fit the guy told me he'd call the DC back and ask why. He will then call me back. No one called us.(2) The next day my wife and I went to the store and was given the run-around by not 1 but 2 employees. When we got home we called the store and demanded to talk to a manager. After a 20 minute wait the woman told me the manager was not available at the moment. I told her to have someone in charge to call me ASAP. No one called me back.(3) The next day after a 15 minute wait on the phone, I FINALLY got ""Joe"" the manager. After blowing off on him he told me he will handle this personally and have my items...(the range exhaust had already been delivered)...delivered as soon as possible. Someone will call me back. No one called back.(4) I called the store the next day and after telling the entire story to the woman who answered, got me through to an assistant manager.

We're to wait 11 MORE DAYS when it's IN THE STORE while I live 3.6 miles away???!!!!! Again, I blew off on him. He said there's no truck going out until Aug 23 but he'll ""See what he can do."" I hung up on him thinking I'll go to the store tomorrow and cause a scene to either get my item delivered sooner or get a police escort out of the store. Incredibly, I GOT A CALL BACK that day saying our cooktop will be delivered TODAY (Aug 16) between 11 & 3. We FINALLY got our cooktop delivered at 11:30!!!

Lowe's Companies,Nightmare,"I bought over $5k dollars of materials to do home improvements from lowes. I went into the lowes store dozens of times just to get someone to help me. Terribly understaffed and the people pretty much hate their jobs. Lowes making billions cant pay the employees a decent wage to not be miserable all day at their jobs. and Double the staff. jesus. 53 billion and you cant put ample staff in a store. and make customers happy not hate you for waiting around all the time trying to get some help. I got decking, and I needed a sliding glass door with a screen. I specified to Ruben in doors and windows to get me the best one I am in a hurry I have my contractor here to buy the materials. He showed me this door. Jeld wen TOP of the Line He Says the best one we have. I said great I will take it to bring it to the front. I asked him if it had a screen he said yes, of course, they all come with a screen door. because at the register the door was still in the back of the store. so I took his word for it. for real what kind of sliding glass door would come without a screen? I thought. makes sense. I went to the register with Ruben and he got credit for making this sale to me. and asked me for a 5-star review for his awesome service. I said sure. I got home the door was delivered the next day. the contractors took it from the guys on the truck and they installed it in my home. once the door was in I said great to put the screen door on. they said it didn't come with one. I was shocked?I went to the store and found Ruben who said what do you mean it doesn't have a screen maybe your contractor has the screen. I called my contractor back and he said no it never had one. I went back to the store and Ruben took me to the Jeld wen doors and he realized they dont have screens. I accepted that it was a mistake at that point. So I said no problem. Just order me one and all is fine. Well, that's when the drama starts. 3 more visits to the store, 1 to customer service, 2 phone calls to Jeld wen, to customer service, nothing. no one can find a screen door for this sliding glass door. what the heck? 3 months now. still no door and more run around.

Oh...OK. one minute he says. 10 minutes later comes out again. Meet me by the contractor area. Go over there. Comes out. Asks for my ID, hands me my receipt. Points to a pile of lumber and asks, do you need help? I foolishly thought they were pulling my order. It was a complete circus and there was no benefit to ordering online at all. Don't bother.

Installer sends 1 man with no equipment to remove toilet, washer and dryer from room to be tiled. My 72 year old husband had to help. Small job took all day but finally done. I had let Lowe's plumbing contractor know the day before tile set we would need him to reinstall toilet, 3 days later I am looking at my toilet in the family room and have 2 more days to go before we can be worked into their busy schedule. Not the best experience. So glad it wasn't a big job.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,Order cancelled 8 weeks after original due date.  Total Screw up.,"Ordered 2 pressure treated deck railing panels and paid to have them delivered for double the individual panel cost. Delivery date was 10 days out. 2 days before panels were due, received E mail delaying delivery for 6 weeks. On day panels were due (52 days from order placement) nothing happened. Called delivery store next day and was told they would call back. They never did. Called 24 hour later and asked to talk to a manager, was put on hold 10 minutes and call dropped. 4 hour later received E mail telling me order was fulfilled and waiting at store 60 min away from store fulfilling on line order, but noticed only one of two panels ordered was listed. Called new store put on hold 15 minutes and call dropped. Borrowed neighbors truck and went to see about order at new store only 1 of two panels was there, no info on other panel, no other panels available in store. So I cancelled order and got a refund.The whole idea was to get the two replacement panels, and repaint my deck. Now not going to happen this summer, so maybe next year.Lowes could have told me up front that the panels were unavailable and I could have made other arrangements. They could have told me they didn't have the panels 51 days from order but didn't. They could have told me they had changed the fulfilling store but didn't. They could have told me they only had a partial order but didn't. I will not order anything from Lowes on line again. I will avoid going to Lowes in the future. Their service is awful.",0,1

She helped me order blinds for our home's windows, and she was extremely attentive and helpful. The blinds have some flaws, and she had advised me on which ones would be better initially, but I opted for the lower cost alternative. This was over a year ago, and then suddenly I hear from her again telling me she found a gift card for me her replacement ignored (was very unimpressed with him). She had changed departments, and found it accidentally as she was helping organize someone else's desk drawer.I can't speak for her fellow employees, but she herself is a very conscientious person who you can rely on for maximum service anytime, and personally deserves five stars.",0,3
Lowe's Companies,Poor management,"On Thursday, August 13, 2020, I submitted an order to pick up on the curbside pickup. Upon arriving at the store, I attempted to notify the store that I was waiting in stall number four. I tried to inform I was waiting by using the store app, and I even called the store several times but received no response from any store employee. I went into the store and called several times, hearing the phone ring. Store employees walked around, checkers talking to one another, and no one would answer the phone. I asked for a store manager to voice my concern. One was called and told the cashier that they were too busy to talk with me. I asked for another manager, and that manager told me they were too busy to speak with me. I then asked for the District Manager's number, and they would not give it to me. The young lady with short hair told me they were busy due to COVID. I told her they were not as busy as people were standing around and talking. This young lady kept saying they were busy. Explain then, if they were so busy, why are people just standing around and talking. The leadership at the Pueblo, Colorado, Hwy 50 Lowes, is deplorable. Many times when you call into the store, the phone will ring continuously with no one answering the phone. Managers won't talk to you, and their communication amongst each other is extremely poor. Based upon the weak leadership at this store: it is clear that the managers of this store have no idea what customer service is and how customer service starts at the top and is demonstrated to their employees by their actions. Those who supervise the Hwy 50 Lowes Managers should be ashamed of the poor leadership they bring to Lowes, and I would be happy to speak to anyone who manages them. Shane.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Delivery Continuously Delayed - Not ordering from them again.,"We ordered two sliding glass doors from Lowe's in June 2020 and had a delivery date of July 8, 2020.

It honestly felt like a punishment for complaining. This morning (August 12) we got the email that the delivery has been pushed back until August 30. We are not sure the doors will get here in time for fall or even winter! We are installing them ourselves and have to keep contacting our friends and family who planned on helping us to delay.

Secondly, the website made it seem as though I had to buy 3 items (costing around $30 or $40) in order for my appliances to be installed, then the delivery team immediately told me they were unnecessary (have to go to the store to return these useless items). Then the washer wasn't working correctly and I realized there was a bit of water damage around my hot and cold water valves in the back.

Lowe's Companies,I only worked here for 2 weeks,"I only worked here for 2 weeks. I was told several lies by the hiring manager. The "" door is always open"" policy is simply not true. I got my head bitten off when I entered the office with a question on behalf of a customer. I was told that employees get use of 2 refrigerators for lunch storage. Days later, my $5 sandwich and my $20 of insulin capsules were thrown in the trash by the front-end manager while I was out on the floor servicing customers. There were no notices that this would be done and no apology.Besides the lies, I worked diligently building a father's day display from over 2 dozen items from the floor. The next day, while I was off, the hiring manager added a cardboard sign and a band of balloons to the display and took full credit for the entire display. When I asked her if she liked what I built, she became short with me and snapped ""I did it"" and stormed off in anger.Finally, the managers had another employee, a 19 year old woman from my department, write a 2-page letter stating several reasons that working with me makes her feel uncomfortable. The main reason for her discomfort was my selfless offer to her of 2 free driving lessons during lunch or after work so the woman could finally obtain a drivers license. Her story about never getting a license was a sad one so I thought a gesture on my part was warranted since I also have a driving instruction license and two-brake vehicle. The other reasons for her discomfort not to work with me was my love for the classic rock coming through the store sound system and sharing personal info about my kids including how my youngest daughter alerted me to her gay lifestyle. All other people know me as a good man and supportive father. But not at Lowe's. For these reasons, I was sat in a chair in a very small room with each of the forementioned managers standing on each side of me, reading the 2 page letter to me in a tone of voice as if I had done unspeakable atrocities. They continually referred to the woman as a "" kid"" scared for her life. When I asked why the woman did not simply tell me these things herself, the hiring manager replied ""Because she's just a kid"". They refused me a copy of the letter.Ten minutes later, after calling my daughter and telling her what happened, she told me to ""get out of there asap"". I told the hiring manager I was quitting and she smiled and said she would even punch me out. That was it.",0,1

Trip #2 to Lowes on 8/5 to get my money back on the $160 I paid them to have a plumber come out. They gave me another number to call. This time, 8/6, an actual plumber came out, said the gas line was not broken, They had the tools to replace the line, and finally got the stove installed. I will never use Lowes again. They should have sent out a plumber on day one. I paid for one, yet it took 4 days to get a gas range installed. Poor customer service.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Very bad customer service,"I was just at lowes looking for a 1/4in flexible extension bit holder l found an employee working on a computer and walked over to him and stood until he asked me without looking at me do you need something I said yes and instead of acknowleding me and asking me what he could help me with he he waited about 30 secs and again not looking at me said do you need something I said yes again and proceed to tell him and show him what I needed his reply was all that we have is over there not looking on his computer or looking around, I found a bit set that has a 6in extension and a Dewalt 12in but that one is to bulky I left and got online and found at their site a 12in one and it is of course at that store I guess from here on I just shop at a different store that is easy enough, I would like to personally thank the manager at that Fairfield location for keeping that very bad employee on the floor to treat customers that way and if you do decide to shop there and you see that person he works in the tools section and has a big birthmark on his left arm don't waist your time speaking to him or just go to homedepot instead",0,1

Lowe's Companies,We recently bought a washer dryer combo…,"We recently bought a washer dryer combo from Lowes and the purchase experience and price point were both good. Where Lowes falters is the installation. They contract this out to a small unprofessional inefficient company that never ever misses an opportunity to underperform and dissapoint. The customer has to contact them to arrange and verify alpoint. Then when they do not show up within the alloted time the lying and excuses start. In this last delivery on the washer dryer they set a time did not make it , indicated we were next on delivery when we called afain and of course did they never showed up. We caught someone on the phone at the end of day and they lied and said someone by the name of Carrie called znd cancelled the delivery. End result we took off work lost wages for rhe day sat around for 8 hrs like fools and was lied to by delivery service as an excuse for not delivering our washer dryer. It bodes the question What good is a service company when they dont provide the very thing they are in business for Service? Lowes really should get its act together and do this inhouse themselves. This is the third time we have been put through this type of disfunctionality to get appliances delivered and installed. I think its time to pay a little more and start buying from the locally owned mom and pop store where junior delivers the products and everyone is happy with the buying experience.",0,1

I asked the crew and they said they refused no one. I called delivery service and was told the driver would be sent back to deliver. When i called again i was told that was not true and they would come tommorow. This is the last time i will order from lowes. You deal with a disreputable delivery service. I told them the crew would be gone soon but they do not consider the customer at all and they lie to you.have also to report that last night i received an automated message that said i would receive delivery between 8:30 and 12:00 today. When i did not receive delivery i called delivery service and was told my delivery was cancelled and call lowes. Lowes had no idea what thats about because my order was not cancelled. Lowes said when truck comes back to lowes with refrigerator i will get delivery tommorow.

Lowe's Companies,worst facilities that I have seen,"The Lowe's Return and Online pick service are among the worst facilities that I have seen, or at least my personal experience with them. From what I saw, they are incredibly inexperienced, asking a question with no end with every transition. The group's general attitude and emotion were grumpy and edgy as if they were smacked up by their boss or just got pissed the hell off and tried to hold it in. They don't have much idea or care about helping the customers. They overly gossip with sensitive topics, gossip is natural, but talking smack about customers that are right in front of you is idiotic and taboo. There must be some ridiculous manager for this extremely lacking service at Milford and lowes. It's as if he beat them with a stick to be so edgy and unwelcoming. I know that working minimum wage and being stuck in a harsh money place can be the most challenging thing that anyone can go through, but if you take a look at Walmart, Mcdonalds or any other service, at least they try to have a mask to help others, with a friendly smile. To at least aim to make sure whoever their serving day is better than there is right now. There needs to be a serious restructure or help for the Staff and how they do things.

Lowe's Companies,Training Improvement Opportunity for Lowe's,This is an opportunity for Lowe's to better train their staff. On July 17 2020 we ordered several thousand dollars worth of decking in the store and our credit card was charged immediately for the full purchase price. The materials should have arrived July 29 2020 We were not told that we could have placed the same order online but not be charged until the decking was delivered. We were told this week that the materials will not be delivered until Oct 13 2020 -- this is 3 months after we ordered it and 2 months after I had to pay my credit card company. We could cancel the in store order and place an online order but that will push the delivery date even further - possibly when there will be snow on the ground. I am very disappointed that our deck has been torn up all summer and that Lowe's has my money and I have nothing.,0,1

Approximately 5 minutes afterwards I received another call from the Gladstone store stating that the washer and parts for the dryer that I had ordered just ""popped up"" on his computer and was unable to deliver the items because they don't make deliveries on Wednesdays. He said corporate should have blocked it. Meanwhile the delivery team from the Independence store where I placed my order arrived at my home with the dryer and parts for the washer. Suffice it to say that this debacle of incompetence left me with no washer or dryer as I refused accept a partial order with no installation. This mess is an example of a mismanagement and a lack of accountability on the part of management. Apparently this is a continuous problem with Lowe's.",0,1

Waited another week until someone called and then another week until they came out and said ""Yes, it's leaking."" I'll place an order for replacement. Again, no one called. I called back again, only one hour this time because I'd learned who the right person was. Again, they hadn't placed the order - even though I heard the guy call in to place it. Another week and the repairperson calls ""Do you have the new faucet?"" No, you need to bring it. Two days for him to figure out how to get the new faucet from the store.

After waiting 6 weeks we canceled the order because the store could not tell us when the appliance would be delivered. We were issued a refund for the refrigerator but not the warranty. Customer Service was going to check on it. Nothing happened after a month. Then customer service told me that either the warranty center would need to issue a refund or the store would need to issue a refund. I can not reach anyone at the warranty center who can help . Just got off the phone with store # 2643 in Brunswick, GA with the Manager On Duty who said she couldn't help me and refused to give me a District Office telephone number. She laughed at me. So in my opinion Lowe's has stolen $120 for an extended warranty on an appliance which was never delivered. Rip Off. I would give them less than 1 star if I could. Worthless.",0,1

Could never get through to Lowe's over the phone but finally ordered the dryer online. Then it took over a month to get delivered and was missing a screw and the entire back electrical plate. The delivery guys just delivered it with no other service except for hauling away the old dryer that cost us $30. I miss our old appliance stores that had great service and actually answered their phones! At least this all happened in the summer so we could hang our clothes outside for a month. We ended up exchanging the machine for a floor model that was cheaper due to a minor side dent since Lowe's refused to give or even sell us the missing parts.

A month later the day the appliances were supposed to be delivered I got a call saying 2 of the appliances were still not in stock and it would be 2 more weeks. 2 weeks later on the day they were supposed to be delivered I got a call and they said they didn't know when they would be in stock and would call me back ""sometime soon"". I've never ordered appliances from Lowes before and I will never order appliances from Lowes again. My customers angry, I'm angry, and Lowes just says sorry nothing we can do.

They said that I am the next stop. I called the store and they told me that one of the delivery people got injured and they just unloaded the truck. This whole time the delivery service was lying to me. I canceled the order. The manager at the store didn't bat an eye and said ok. You would think they would do something to appease me but no they just canceled the order and lost a customer who had purchased many large ticket items in the past.

We were so excited because we had also just purchased our first home! We unloaded the old refrigerator and waited for our lovely new refrigerator. It started to rain and the delivery guys finally showed up. As they brought the refrigerator in they got in such a hurry they shoved it in the front door scratching the whole side door. They said it could be replaced the following day just call the number they gave us. I called the next day and the dispatcher said she would have someone call. No one ever called. The next day I called Lowes and Les, said this is the first he has heard about it but he would make sure we got a new door. Today as they bring us our new door they leave and it is all off, and not level. The delivery guys left with it like that!!! I called Lowes once again and sent Les, pictures and he apologizes and says he will have to come fix the doors as they are way off. This is ridiculous, we have spent to much money for this to happen!!! If the delivery guys weren’t in such a huge hurry and if they wouldn’t have shoved the refrigerator through the door like they just didn’t care this wouldn’t have happened. Thankfully Les, from Lowes is coming to fix it. He shouldn’t have to come after he gets off work to fix someone else’s mess up!!! We appreciate him very much and all he has done for us. On the other hand Lowes these guys are driving your trucks representing your company and when they come to your customers homes and do this, that looks bad on you guys!

Lowe's Companies,IT'S VERY SAD!,"It's very sad, I came in three weeks ago to Lowe's in Hialeah and opened up a pro account for my business. I ordered over $4,000 worth of material. I was told the special orders would take three weeks to receive. Which at the time I was okay with. All the products were supposed to be delivered August 1st. On that day I heard my dog barking at the front door. By the time I was able to get to it there was no one there. But there were two large boxes sitting up next to the door. One was okay to handle the other one was pretty heavy. And as I moved it inside I can hear something rattling inside. Figuring it was probably the tile saw that I had ordered. Once I opened it up I found it was the toilet that I had ordered. The entire base was broken in pieces. Apparently the delivery guys just dropped it off and ran without speaking to me or let me know it was even from Lowe's. I contacted Lowe's that day to have it scheduled for a pickup so I could receive a new one. I was also expecting the two other large packages that day that never came. I went to Lowe's the next day and talked to customer service. they explained to me that it will be delivered on Monday between 10:30 and 2:30. my wife was willing to stay home from work to receive the packages. 6:30 p.m. rolls around and still nothing. Now I'm livid because my wife took the whole day off to receive a vanity and a tile saw. But nothing came to the door. I attempted to call the store five times with either the pro desk or customer service and received no answer after it rang for a minute and then hung up.

Then she proceeded to say the #2 was going to be sent from the League City store - 2 hours from me - it will also be another week before they can ship 4 letters. Worst service in the world. Next time I will just go to the local hardware store and pick up my order.

Lowe's Companies,Do NOT Buy From Lowes (Horrible Customer Service),"My advice: avoid purchasing from Lowe's. Why? Horrible customer service.We ordered a pergola to be delivered to our house. It was supposed to arrive on 7/31. We received no updates from Lowes, and when we checked the order number online, it gave us no delivery updates.We called Lowes on Friday (on hold 40 min), Saturday (on hold approx 30 min), and Sunday (on hold approx 20 min) asking for updates. Each time we received different info, but the main point being that we needed to call back on Monday and ask to escalate to a supervisor.Called on Monday and was on hold for over 90 minutes. Agent was condescending and argumentative. Refused to let me speak with a supervisor and stated that they were ""busy with other customers."" Evidently I don't rank high enough to talk to a supervisor. Finally gave me contact info for the freight delivery company, after asking numerous times. Each tiny bit of info you need, you must explicitly ask for - they do not volunteer info or actually try to help you.I asked what they were going to do to make this right, because at this they've cost both me and my husband time, as well as they've delayed us with two contractors that we have on standby. They offered 10% off which equated to about $140 and honestly felt like an insult. Did I mention that the pergola will be delivered a week late on top of this?Requested to speak to supervisor again, waited another 20 min, and then the supervisor was equally as unhelpful. I asked her if she really thought $140 off was acceptable after all the time and effort that Lowes had cost us. She said that she ""wasn't commenting on acceptability but that is what they were prepared to offer."" I told we would never shop with them again.

I got sick if waiting around to be contacted to go pick up my item from either one of these locations, so because the website shows MULTIPLE amounts of my item, I chose to just go to the locations and pull it off the shelf and buy it, rather than wait until hell freezes over to be contacted. Well, the Littleton store didn’t have ANY of the item that I ordered online, even though the website stated they had TEN! I then went to the GREENWOOD VILLAGE location and finally found one on the shelf and bought it. I’m NOT buying the excuse that Lowes has a “high volume of orders due to the pandemic” and just can’t seem to find the time to process online orders in a respectable time frame. When I walked in at the GREENWOOD VILLAGE location, the store was virtually empty of customers and the clerks (if I could have found one) were just sitting around DOING NOTHING, and definitely NOT filling orders and contacting customers. It’s no small wonder that Lowes locations are going out of business, because they certainly don’t know how to run one.",0,1

This soon changed when I got home and no power washer. Checked security cameras, no delivery all day whatsoever. Thought maybe the delivery service still had it and would deliver first thing Saturday, nope. Wife called Lowe’s customer service and waited online for over 40 min before a live body answered. Got hung up on when someone finally did answer. Frustrating and irritating to say the least. Called again and waited on hold again for close to an hour. Once a person answered they tracked our order and informed us it wouldn’t be delivered until the following Tuesday. Had a lengthy talk with wife about cancelling order. Decided to wait until Tuesday and see if it gets delivered. Frustrated that product didn’t arrive as indicated originally. Cleared weekend to complete project with this power washer.

Lowe's Companies,A little bit goes a long way.,"I have been shopping at Lowes instead of Home Depot for awhile now because Lowes WAS more home owner friendly unlike Home Depot that caters to contractor. I needed paint so I went to Lowes (50 miles round trip) to buy a quart of paint to finish my project, The paint guy said they did not have any quart size and failed to offer any suggestions such as another brand or something. box store doesn't have more then one kind of paint??? What Lazy employee!!! I asked for the manager because I have no patience for people in the customer service business that don't offer suggestions to the customer as an effort to help a customer. That is part of their job. The manager (Daniel) at the Yuba City Lowes could give a sh-t, told me that their was a nation shortage on quarts, so I called another Lowes to confirm if that was true, I made the call because I had a sense that Daniel was lying and was giving me some BS answer because I am a woman. Sure enough it was a lie so I happily drove to Home Depot got the paint I needed, I had a great conversation with the clerk at Home Depot that turned out to be one of the managers there. He also confirmed their was not a national shortage and offered me a free quart if the one he mixed for me did not match the paint that I needed that came from Lowes originally. That's what customer service is!!!! Home Depot made a sale including all the other items that I needed and Lowe's lost a customer/buyer.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes online is the worst,"Lowes Online is the worst. I ordered raised cedar wood beds. It took 26 days to arrive after it was promised with a few days delivery. I could not cancel the order as customer service took too long on hold.Upon arrivl, huge disappointment. These were not cedar first of all just regular pine. One of them was a returned product taped up. While unpacking, there was no way to know and cut my hand quite badly on exposed staples. Then after taking out the wood, I noticed they were rotten in sections. Some panels were tinted with stain. This was a return as the previous buyer shipped product back. Holes had already been drilled in. Screws were not returned. They also damaged the wood in several places. Lowes just repackaged defective product and shipped to the next buyer. The second set had chipped wood with splinters. The wood was not aligned properly. So my guess is, it was put together in a rush. I thought it would save time but its easier to just do it myself.On website, they could not help at all. On customer 1-800 service for an hour on hold. I called up the local store and cannot get to anybody but the lady at curbside pickup was helpful and offered to have someone come out to help take it in. Just wanted to return the crap product, which I did. The Lowes person came out and helped take it in.I will not shop at Lowes Online for large products again.

Lowe's Companies,Horrible customer service.,"I've never been this disappointed in a business. Long story, short comment. I'm a Veteran and a member of their Vet rewards card program for a long time. Lowes has been my home improvement store of choice since 2005. I bought a storm door July 2020 and had it installed by Lowes prior to my house sale. It was installed and I locked the door to preclude any issues before the sale. I used it once, a week after installation, and saw the installation was not thorough...hinges and rods were not straight. I went back to the store to schedule a followup and 10 days later they were a no-show. Second try resulted in a house visit and they said it was damaged by wind and would not repair the installation. I shared with the supervisor that the door was not used but she claimed otherwise and implied I was lying. I won't go on a campaign to bad-mouth the company, but when the situation arises when I can make a recommendation rest assured I will do all I can to dissuade anyone doing business with Lowes.

He really tried to straighten out the mess!When my range arrived the next morning, I noticed that the glass heating surface was scratched, the bottom warming drawer would not close correctly and the front left leg was missing. The range looked like an old stove that someone threw out onto the sidewalk. The electric cords they ( I paid extra) gave me were old/used. The rubber that surrounded the wires were old and cracked.The delivery guy asked if I had brought a used range. I told him no and refuse to accept this range.

Nobody call and no delivery on that day, waste another day. I checked on Lowe’s website said reschedule to deliver on 7/17. Again, 3rd time no delivery and nobody calls on 7/17. I checked on Lowe’s website again, it said schedule to deliver on 7/20; no one came. Again rescheduled 5th time on 7/24, no show. We wasted total 5 days waiting for Lowe’s delivery.Updated: I went to Lowe’s store on 7/26 and talked to customer services. After 15 minutes, she said one item is not available and don't know when will have. Five minutes later, she said all items I ordered are not available!!! They have lost all my trust, horrible business.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,0 credit for Lowe’s,0 credit for Lowe’s! We decided to use Lowe’s to install new flooring and it was awful. The floor was squeaky and my wall was all messed up.

It was installed within 24 hours and the guys who came did an excellent job. My stairs are not the easiest. They needed to be capped and I have several pie shape stairs. They knew exactly what they were doing. After having a real bad experience with Home Depot about trying to get this rug installed, I canceled them and went to Lowe's and was glad I did. They have my business now, no more Home Depot. I gave them a bad review and will no longer do business with them.",0,5

I don't think i'll be shopping there anymore. If they can't even get a credit score right, I don't think they will be getting anymore of my hard earned money. It looks like i'll be going to Home Depot from now own and continue using my card with them, that had no problem getting. I spend around $600.00 a month in Lowes and Home Depot. Looks like Lowes will no longer get a dime from me anymore.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,You've Been Warned!,"When my husband and I purchased appliances from Lowes last November, I never imagined that nearly nine months later, we would have an unresolved issue with our oven. Currently, we have a gap underneath our oven that did not exist with our previous oven. We intentionally chose an oven to fit our existing oven configuration with a few tweaks and we had the installer (Michael & Sons) review our configuration before completing our purchase. Instead of recounting the various issues we have experienced with both our initial oven installation and customer service, I strongly urge you to avoid purchasing appliances from Lowes. No one involved in our process has a vested interest in resolving our issue, including the installer (Michael & Sons), the Lowes Customer Service Team, and the Lowes Leesburg store. If I read the various concerns other customers shared across multiple websites, I would have avoided this store like the plague! Please save yourself infinite hours of frustration and shop at a local store where your patronage matters. The Lowes infrastructure is barely equipped for a cookie cutter install, nevertheless an install that requires minor custom configuration. Purchase your appliances from a business that can actually communicate and provide customer service!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Purchased Washer and Dryer at Lowe’s Wauwatosa Wi,"I purchased a washer and dryer on 6/26/20, was told that it would take 10 days, to get the order. July 10 no phone call or email, I finally called them and I kept getting disconnected or put on hold. Finally, spoke to a customer service rep who said the dryer would be another week. Gave them a week before calling. I was on hold over an hour, before I was disconnected. Called back and was told the dryer had been delivered to the store on Tuesday and supposedly they tried calling me. They never made an attempt to call or send an email. Today there were supposed to deliver it between 9 and noon. It is now 3:00 pm, no phone call, nothing. I work from home, but still had to rearrange my day, and make accommodations with my condo association. I just hate that I will have to call the store and be put on hold or disconnected several times before getting a human on the phone.",0,1

With all the publicity about shortages of these materials he could have just told me they didn’t ‘t have any and I’d have accepted it. He went the extra mile and I am very impressed. I have been a long time customer and after this experience will remain a loyal fan. Thank you Chris,0,5

All employees and the manger were unconcerned about not being able to provide what was told to their customer. One girl even laughed.

Lowe's Companies,Customer service wait is too long,Picked up a wall cabinet and found one of the hinges was damaged. It was damaged when assembled on cabinet.

I will go to Menards or Home Depot in future.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,VERY DISGUSTED!,Since when is it good practice for a Lowes “associate” to shush a costumer (with finger in the air) when trying to ask for help? If I could give a negative rating I would give a minus 10! I have dealt with so many disappointing encounters at the local store for the last 2 decades.If Home Depot was more convenient for me I’d give all my business to them!! It’s BULL!!,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Couldn't Care Less About Vets or Customer Safety,"If there was a way of rating with negative stars, I'd rate it -10. I have a veterans discount that works when I purchase in person but apparently not when ordering online. I work in software and this is a software problem and simple to fix if there was anyone, and I mean anyone competent in either the 800 Customer Service Center or their Lakewood Store in Denver metro. I clocked in over three hours of wasted time on the phone and and in-person visit to another Lowe's for assistance and came away with nothing. Fortunately, I was able to work while I wasted my time on the phone and further frustration when I made a trip to another Lowe's and they were incompetent. There was not a single person in three locations who could answer a question, or straighten out the veterans discount problem. FYI, Lowe's pays lip service to customers not wearing a mask. In my 15 minutes in one of their stores, five persons walked by without a mask. This is the absolute worst customer experience I have ever had. Not surprisingly, the majority of their reviews are negative. I have no idea how they stay in business. Awful.....awful.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Old school service. A+ remedy,"Purchased a very large GE microwave oven after the one we had for 10 years went. When Lowe's delivery service delivered the wrong model they came back and got the wrong one and delivered the correct one. One month later when it seemed like the buttons weren't responding correctly on the new one which was the same General Electric very large model we had that lasted for 10 years, they came back out and got it because it was within the first month and brought back out another one and set it up and took the old one away. I was very impressed by the man in charge at our local Lowe's and the fact that they kept on working with us until everything was right. It felt like old school small company service. Very impressed. We are innertown Northeast of Boston and I believe the Lowe's we work with is in Danvers.",0,4

Stopped as soon as he made a right turn on the street and parked in the entrance/blocking in and outgoing traffic-- then, he crossed the road and walked to my home to tell me that he can't deliver my washer because, the lines on my lot are too low. I videoed his abandoned truck on jamestown st. The homes on this lot are just as high if not higher than his truck (the homes are on the video too), how does he think that our homes got here. Talk about insulting my intellect. He said he would tell Lowes to have a pickup truck deliver the washer.

A second sales associate told me to look around the store.A third sales associated helped a bit but he also appeared to be annoyed. Definitely something is wrong at that store.

Lowe's Companies,Dissatisfied Greenville Texas customer,"I am live in Greenville Texas.

The total was 2824.00, a week later I was informed that the carpet had a pattern that needed to be matched so I was charged a extra $500 for a extra 400 sq ft. A week later I was told that carpet could not be installed because it was only three year carpet and needed to be a ten year carpet for a commercial building. $3281.99 and still not a completed deal. Then I was told it would be another 14 days to get another carpet. I just asked for a refund from the Assistant Manager, The head Manager was standing there when got my refund and did not even apologize for the very poor customer service.

Lowe's Companies,Delivery debacle/customer service non-existent,"Ordered a stove mid-May. Scheduled for delivery mid-Jun. On the delivery day, I took leave to be home to receive it. Never came. After 12 phone calls, I finally reached an actual human being, who then told me my delivery date had been changed three times and was now set for Mid July. No call. No text. No email, No smoke signals. Nothing. So, the day before the latest delivery date I got notification they were planning to deliver. One day of notice. :-( So, I stay home waiting for the delivery in this 4-hour window of time. At the very last minute of this delivery window, the truck pulls up in front of my house. The one guy comes in to move my old stove out of the way, taking no care what so ever not to tear up my floor, which he was immediately doing by dragging the stove out of place without anything under it. I had to finish moving it out myself so my floor didn't get ripped up more, so he could get it on the dolly. I told them the cord from my old stove needed to be installed on the new stove. They acted surprised by this. That IS part of ""delivery and installation"". So, they are installing the cord on the new stove but weren't including the retention clamp. I told the guy they were missing a piece. He scoffs and says ""I do this without that all the time."" I was adamant that he install the retention clamp. They didn't even know how to install it. I had to show them. They didn't bother to finish moving my old stove into my garage. Just left it sitting in the driveway, so I had to do that myself. They didn't even have the tools necessary to do any of this work. They had to borrow my tools. No box cutter to open the box. No screwdriver to install the cord. And they didn't install the anti-tip bracket. I didn't realize THAT part until they were already gone. And they left without returning my box cutter. Didn't even make sure to return what they had borrowed. WORST experience EVER!!! I will NEVER buy a major appliance from Lowes again. I should have gone with my first instinct and gone with a local appliance store. More money but I bet they would have done things right ALL the way. Horrible!!! I would give NO stars if I could, but one was the lowest this would let me go.",0,1

Then Gretchen helped me with some zip ties. She is so bubbly and willing to make all her customers very happy when they shop at Lowes. I spoke to her manager, Andrea about her excellent customer service, and of course Andrea was delighted. I hope Gretchen gets the pluming department position she is trying for because she is the greatest.",0,5

Lowe's Companies,BTW only gave one star as could not…,BTW only gave one star as could not leave it blank. Boo hoo it deserves no star!! Gifted a new dishwasher by my son who lives out of town and it was delivered in box today with no installation. I was told by delivery people that Lowe's does not install small appliances only large ie refrigerators. It sits in my living room in the box. When I questioned son who paid for connection hoses and an extended warranty for his mom he was not informed this is their policy. If I could lift it up and return it I would . Shoddy service!!! They should inform customers prior to buying online or in person that is their policy. Needless to say I am disappointed and very upset by this. Wish he had used Home Depot who does not have that as their policy. I will try to get someone to install it but does this cause my warranty to be null and void if damaged by customer. Come on Lowe's covid or not this is wrong! Was on hold for 20 minutes just to talk to appliance dept at store who delivered it to ask that question. Just gave up out of frustration. This is why I wish he had used Home Depot and why I will avoid buying things from you folks at all and will inform my friends and co workers about this.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Another company with horrible support.…,"Another company that is following today's trends and telling you that they do not want to support you. Buy from us , but please do not call. They do not even have ""Talk to representative on their automated idiot"". You can get there but it is not straight forward at all. Then, business is good but they do not hire enough support people. I wonder if these companies ever analyze how many customers they lose by saving money on support. I think today's crop of overpaid CEOs are incompetent. I was a good customer too.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Worst service ever.  Ordered washer/dryer online.,"We placed an order for washer/dryer on the 29th of the month. Here it is July 14. ""supposed"" to be delivered today. Has been showing online as READY FOR DELIVERY for a week. Have still never heard a PEEP from anyone at Lowes. Other than I was charged a few days ago, and when I called to confirm it had gone through (the bank identified it as fraud) the woman told me 4 times they never charge until delivery. But when I persisted, explaining it was an unlikely coincidence that a charge from Lowes in the exact amount of my order would be charged to me 2 days before delivery - and NOT be Lowes. She eventually backtracked and said yes they charged me. Leaving me horribly confused. But nevertheless. Still NOTHING. It is so weird. Selling things is what they actually offer as their business. Delivering large things that they sell shouldn't be unusual either. And yet... I would cut them some slack for it being a pandemic - but in that case, I would expect online and phone support to be the preferred method over in-store. And yet... that has failed MISERABLY because I cannot get anyone to even talk to me or provide any information. Why oh why did we not use Home Depot like we always do??? UGH. Lesson Learned",0,1

There was one manager who claims they would look into it, but never heard anything back today. If I could give no stars, I would, but it’s not an option. I’ll never shop at Lowe’s again.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's is PATHETIC,"Lowe's is PATHETIC. The outside contractors suck, they do a sloppy job and don't return to repair something that breaks in a week not to mention the delivery service sucks even more. They don't show up on time and never call to alert a delay. My first experience was a storm door installation that the lock broke in under 1 week. It was scheduled for repair, they never showed up and I fixed it myself. The next was a lumber delivery that was several hours late and even after we had a time for delivery, they claimed we didn't. That's 100% bull, next a refrigerator delivery that was scheduled when they called automated to say delivery time was 1pm to 5pm, not 8am to noon as scheduled. Expo the curior service they use SUCKS AND SUCKS BIG TIME. Nobody to answer the call at the Madison Ave location in Reading Pennsylvania. Just to get rerouted several times and lose connection. Over 1 hour on hold to speak to a company representative. She at least was able to give me some type of time frame. Still the service is unacceptable on every level including the associates that know little to nothing about the development they work in. Maybe the next time I have to send in a payment it'll be late if at all. This is the thought of many people who purchased stuff from Lowe's. Tells you something about how this company is run since I see the same complaints from other locations locally and throughout the states. All my business from now on will be from any place other than The Incompetent Lowe's. Hey there you go, change your name to The Incompetent Lowe's, at least you'll be truthful. Just to update, they still didn't show up or call. So I call in to Lowe's to cancel the order and out of curiosity I asked where is the refrigerator. They said it was brought back to the store because the delivery service couldn't deliver it. So that also means at the delivery service last stop they were supposedly at which was 5 minutes from my house, they had to pass by to take my refrigerator back to the store. Pathetic and unacceptable.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Terrible customer service,"I am a disabled veteran who also was denied 10% discount on the recent purchase of a garage ready refrigerator which cost $828; they said it was on sale even though the price on the ticket did not reflect that! Then when it arrived at the Mentor, Ohio store we could not get delivery for three weeks, which was unsatisfactory. Therefore we did them a favor and went to the store and rented their pickup truck and brought it home ourselves, which saved them a third-party deliver later this month. We do not think we should have been charged $20 for the truck rental for less than an hour to drive it 16 miles round trip since they can't deliver their products in a timely manner! Earlier last month we purchased a John Deere tractor from Lowe's Willoughby, Ohio store and waited three weeks for that to be delivered as well.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's SUCKS,"I ordered my husband a Longhorn smoker/grill combo online for his birthday. The grill was delivered 4 days later while we were on vacation. When we returned, we opened the box to put the grill together. Literally EVERY piece was bent and twisted. We drove the grill to the nearest Lowe's and returned it. Due to not every location having these in stock, I had to call a store to confirm they had them in stock. I did this and then ordered again online for delivery. I received an email confirmation with my delivery date as well as a phone call from the trucking company stating my order would deliver the next day between 8:30 am and 12:30 pm. I waited all day and never received my order. I called Lowe's customer service the next day and they said I would get a return call within 24 hours. I then called the trucking company and they said somebody from Lowe's cancelled my order and to call Lowe's. I called the Lowe's where I placed my order and at first couldn't get through. Finally, they picked up and put me on hold for 25 min and I gave up and hung up. I called back and finally got a human being that said nobody cancelled my order, my order just hadn't been ""pulled"" yet. I am so frustrated with this whole buying from Lowe's and once I receive my order (it's the only place I can find this grill), I will NEVER buy another thing from Lowe's.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Loews wants to go out of business,I have been trying to order from this store online for months. Every order from Refrigerators to hand tools always has a snag in the online system if I want it shipped. So I call and the phone rings forever then gets picked up and slammed down. On the occasion when the system picks up I am left on hold for up to 87 minutes.Yesterday after 2 hours on the phone I was able to order the refrigerator. It was suggested to order it for pickup. Then arrange a shipper to bring it to my home. This morning I got a call from a very nasty mean woman in Rapid City who said there policy prevents them to ship beyond Spearfish (50 miles). No ifs ands or buts period and hung up. She said they are reversing the charge on my card. I just wanted to use the credit card and I live out in a small town in south eastern Montana. It is a 5 hour drive to either store in Rapid City or Bismark. So shipping is my only option.I have yet to even place an order. I have given up and decided that Loews sucks and found this thread. I am adding my vote. Loews sucks.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Situations like this are a comedy routine and illustration of what not to do.,"I ordered a washer and dryer set from Lowes. I wanted to make sure they were in the store because of the rampant delays in appliance restocking, which makes sense given COVID-19 pandemic. I ordered the set I wanted that was also in the store. The set was to be delivered on the Sunday two days after purchase. The driver delivered the dryer and suggested that I call the store. After six times of calling and having someone at the store pick up the phone and hang up without saying hello, I finally got someone on the phone and told them my story about purchasing ones in the store. I was told ""Oh we sold those to someone else, you are on the waiting list,"" When I objected, I was told ""We are busy. Do you know how long our line is? You washer is backordered and we will let you know when we get enough in to fulfill the list of people before you."" And he (a manager) hung up on me. Seven days later, I called back to see if I could return the dryer that is sitting in my closet. After three times of someone at the store picking up the phone and hanging up, someone at the stores gets on the phone and says ""we will have someone call you back and hangs up,"" they didn't get my phone number and I am pretty sure that I don't have telepathy to receive the psychic message of them getting back to me. But I might be wrong. Situations like this are a comedy routine and illustration of what not to do.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Unprofessional and poor communication,"I purchased a washing machine on June 24th from Lowes of Fayetteville, Arkansas. It was scheduled to be delivered on 4th of July weekend. I tried to get it rescheduled for Monday as I was going to be out of town. I spent much time on the phone trying to reach someone in delivery to schedule a delivery time that actually worked with my schedule. Finally I left a message that I was out of town when they had scheduled to deliver and to please call me. I did not receive a call until the next Monday and was told that he had someone sick and if we could have it delivered on Tuesday. I agreed even though my heavy furniture had been moved to make a path for the washer. On Tuesday, he called and said his worker was still sick and could he deliver it on Wednesday. I agreed. No washer came on Wednesday and no call was made to explain why. No delivery person answered calls I made on Wednesday nor Thursday. I left a message for him to call me on Thursday. No one called me back. After going through the usual routine of being transfered to delivery for no one to answer, I finally asked to speak to a manager. I was once again put on hold as the manager was in a meeting. After being transferred to multiple people, one of which was friendly and showed some degree of empathy for my frustrations and then another employee or manager (not sure which) who had a snarky hateful attitude and tone, I was able to get to the bottom of the problem. There had been a problem with my credit card and they had without calling me canceled my entire order. This was a simple fix as I had several other credit cards that could have been used. But instead, they ignored my calls and messages, did not call me and tell me there was any problem with my payment method, canceled 2 deliveries and then did not keep their last scheduled delivery and canceled my order. So I had to reorder the washing machine and it is scheduled to be delivered 12 days from now!!!!! I have spent thousands of dollars at Lowes during the last year alone.

Lowe's Companies,I AM A LANDLORD AND I BEG YOU NOT TO WORK WITH LOWES!!!,"I am a landlord and I operate a rental unit at Washington DC. On 6/23/2020 my tenant reported that the fridge in the unit is broken. On the same day, I ordered a fridge from Lowes. I was told at the time of the purchase that the fridge would be delivered on 6/29/2020. I was told that it should take 6 days. Ok, this would solve problems. I move forward with the order. The only reason I made this purchase through Lowe's is, they can deliver the fridge on 6/29/2020.Then within a short period of time, another email arrives and claims the fridge will arrive on 7/2/2020. My tenant is furious, screaming at me, rightfully complaining that all his food is rotting. He can't eat anything at home. Because of COVID-19, he can't eat outside. He is living in unacceptable conditions.Then surprise surprise, Lowes is at work. Another email arrives, the fridge is scheduled for delivery on 7/7/2020.A day before delivery I receive an email from Spirit, the extremely incompetent company, for final confirmation and I confirm the delivery.It is 7/7/2020. The supposed delivery day. Lowes is supposed to deliver the fridge. NOBODY AROUND! NO CALLS. NO ONE BOTHERS TO LET ME KNOW WHY THIS DELIVERY DID NOT GO THROUGH. MY TENANT CALLS AT THE END OF THE DAY AND SCREAMS AT ME, I AM DONE WITH YOU. I CANNOT BLAME HIM. HE IS THREATENING ME WITH A LAWSUIT NOW!!!!Naturally, I call Sprit, the delivery firm Lowes works. They first claim it was not in the truck on 7/7/202. Someone at Spirit assures me that it will be taken care of ASAP. Spirit tells me that they will send an email to Lowes. I call Lowes at Washington DC. The store in Washington DC does not even take any phones. The next day, all day no news. As if I never purchased a fridge. I paid for all services and after getting my money, Lowes decided to disappear. They decided to forget about it. They got the money, but they don't bother with delivering the fridge. So I need to fix Lowes' issues, since Lowes does not care. Here we go again. Lowes customer service calls. Nothing. They say call Spirit. So I call Spirit again. They now started to claim someone called with your number and canceled the order. The story changed. No one uses my phone except me. And I did not cancel any order. This is a total lie. I call Lowes again, I ask to talk with a supervisor. I am being told that I should file a claim in a written format. Then it should take 24 hours for the ""Big Lowes' help..."". This is not a good option when the tenant is in full-blown anger. I did everything right but apparently I am working with the wrong firm, that does not even care. I call Spirit. Now they know my number and they are willingly do not open it. Just to prove their unwillingness to take calls from my number, I get a new Google Voice number, and then I call Spirit again. When they see a different number they take the call. Now they are saying you canceled it. No one canceled any orders. I am asking for a person who knows what he/she is doing. No one cares. They say it's not possible. On 7/9/2020 I call Spirit, ask to talk with their manager. They say the manager is gonna call you. But no calls.Then I call Lowes. I want to file a complaint. The first phone number they gave me looks like this: 1 374 327 73782. Something is wrong, this is not a US phone number. I ask the customer service person to check the number and tell me a real number. I get 1 347 7382. And then I call that number to file a complaint, that number does not even work. LOWES HAS A VERY SAD AND BAD STYLE.In the duration of this terrible experience, I had to call both Lowe's and Spirit a total of 20-25 times. No one wants to help. NO ONE DESERVES THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE THE LANDLORD AND OBLIGATED TO SOLVE YOUR TENANTS ISSUES ASAP. THIS WHOLE THING DESTROYED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY TENANT.The fridge is still not delivered at the time I am writing this review.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Washington MO Lowe's NOT AFFECTED BY COVID,Washington MO Lowe's is ridiculous. I went to return something from lowes.com from 3/27/2020 on 7/8/2020. We had to get the floor manager who informed me that it was over 90 days. I said we had/have COVID restrictions. She again informed me that they were open. I said ok but we weren't supposed to be doing unnecessary trips etc. She said I could reach out to the company that sent the knobs. I called lowes.com and after 1 hour got someone who said their policy is 180 days from purchase due to COVID. She took care of me and I will return to a LOWES elsewhere. I called the Lowe's back to explain their policy to them. Phil the floor manager said I was wrong and it is 90 days. I then googled it and it says 180 days during COVID. The stupidity of your floor managers and the arrogance of just because they were open... Use common sense people.,0,1

I got rude service and a delivery driver that should have been fired. When we finally got the 3rd party out to actually install our 2nd room, because the measurements were wrong, he didn’t have our 2 rolls of carpet. He let me know he had a bigger job to do and had to leave our house leaving us in disbelief. We offered to drive to Lowe’s to pick up the carpet they never picked up because he informed us Lowe’s wouldn’t pay his gas but they were in a hurry to go do a bigger job. On the third attemp to install our carpet we were told the team would be late because they had to drive to Roanoke to get our padding. I let them know our padding was already installed on the first visit to our house and we just wanted our carpet! Lowe’s service is beyond unacceptable and we should be compensated for our troubles. After all, we originally removed all the furniture and carpet and padding before they arrived so we saved Lowe’s the hard work.

Well day before we get a call from the store saying oops we dont actually have the materials..how do you not know if you do or do not have materials in the first place. Then we are told the pickets are on back order due to Covd, well can do much about that. Of course they cant tell me when they actually expect them to be in. A couple more weeks go by and they finally have pickets, hooray! But oh wait we dont actually have 2 other big items in that we forgot to tell you about..couple days go by and they call to say they can do the install with slightly different materials for the posts and the concrete but wont change the quality of the fence. Fine. Installer is supposed to get back to us to move forward and we have yet to hear from this guy. The Corporate office cant even seem to get ahold of this guy. Seriously doubting his ability to now install my fence and it not fall apart in a year. Store keeps giving me the run around but I've waited this long.

The two big companies are this one and the orange one. This is more for the upkeep while the other is more for actual building. For such an incredible large company, they sure don't care about their customers. Service is horrible, some products are cheap and when there are questions about anything, the attitude is...,why are you bothering me!? Corporate should look into ""how to make your patrons feel like they matter."" They, corporate, should re-train the whole staff on customer service. I don't care if I have to spend a few bucks more to get better service and better products. If there was a more competitive company near by...I would never step foot in another store like this.

Lowe's Companies,Delivery wash,"Recently I purchased, first a washer then 2 months later a dryer, from the online site of Lowe's. Everything went as well as expected through the transaction. I expected a long waiting period as it was during the isolation period I made these purchases. However, within a week period each item was being delivered to my outside of town address. The washing machine was delivered by two well mannered, friendly yet professional gentlemen who seemed to know what they were doing. The first delivery we had to buy hoses and an adapter plug not knowing that Lowe's did not supply them with their machines they sold nor did anyone or the site mention it. The second delivery knowing what happened with the first I ordered everything I could think of that might not come with the machine. However, my husband wasn't aware I had and I was not home at time of delivery. So the delivery crew told him we needed an adapter plug and exhaust hose but they had an extra adapter in their truck we could have. Giving us an old adapter. Mind you I had purchased both hose and a brand new adapter. They kept my new adapter.",0,3

Extremely rude. The second time I opened an account to save 10% . I was using that card and my fathers for his discount . The cashier tried to figure it out and was unable.

Lowe's Companies,Cluster,"Every time I've been into a Lowe's I've been disappointed. They are constantly out of stock on items, and the display models are always trashed, so who wants that? This particular complaint is on behalf of my parents who ordered 3 free-standing garden beds, back in early April. After a month without a delivery or an email explaining where they were, my Dad called and was told they were on their way. Of course, Covid was used as an excuse for delayed shipping times, but when you order something before everything shut down, that's all it is; an excuse. Fast forward another month without the delivery. Dad cancelled the order and at that time, Lowe's didn't even know what happened to the shipment at all. Fast forward another month and he gets a call from a Lowe's in Louisville, KY asking:""Hey we have 3 garden beds here, do you want them?""He had already ordered from Home Depot, so he declined. How did their order end up in Kentucky, when it was supposed to go to Nevada? No one cares about this at Lowes. Nobody offered a solution, or a sincere apology.

She speaks to you in a condescending manner as though you can take it or leave it. When the second washer was installed she told me that I may have to pay for a service call fee. Excuse me, I don't think so. There was no way I was paying a service fee for a washer that gave an error message on the first run and had been in my home for less than 24 hours. After cancelled orders, failed communications, being delivered used and defective machines she wanted to offer me $100 store credit. I told her try again. She called two hours later and offered $250 store credit. I told her call me back when she is ready to talk cash, why should I be forced to continue to shop at your store.

So Jeremy whom I also talked to, one of the times I went in there, he called me and told me he could find a vendor that had the product I needed.

However, she's just a miniscule part of the problem. So, I don't understand why customer service phone wait times are as long as they are, on an average expect to wait a half hour, for someone to tell you they can't help you at all, like REALLY WHAT'S THE PURPOSE of having customer service then??If I have to call the store to get a refund and wait more precious time.I've been a Lowe's customer for some time now but after I receive my refund, that's the end of my business with this company.This isn't the first issue I've had with them either, all the issues everyone else talks about and gives bad reviews for are valid.Please spend your money and time at another company.

Called on Monday (6:21am) to get a time window for the delivery and I was told it will arrive on Tuesday. Then I got a confirmation email stating it will arrive on Thursday. When I called customer support instead of taking responsibility they actually blamed colleagues for the confusion without taking any responsibility.

Lowe's Companies,Not  an ethical company,"I went in to get a color match for my deck, I wanted to use the rust-oleum 6x deck restorer since it is tint- able, and clearly a superior product to the Cabot deck paint, well to my surprise the Lowes paint spectrograph could not read the sample to come up with a mix, Home Depots spectrograph had no problem reading the color for its deck paint. I suspected a scam, and sure enough Lowes spectrograph has been “fixed” not to allow color matches between the paints it sells, in other words once you buy one brand, in this case Cabot’s, you are stuck with it for a lifetime. I had them run several of Cabot’s colors for the Rust-oleum and none of them could be color matched, I had them do the reverse, and sure enough none of rust-oleum paints could be color matched to Cabot’s deck paint, I had no problem getting a color match at Home Depot and had no problem getting color matches between brands at Home Depot. In a way this is price fixing, if one goes on sale you will not be able to take advantage of the sale, or if in this case one product is clearly superior to the other you will have to color change the entire deck. And don’t even try to go down the road of copyright, you cannot copyright colors. I’ll be doing all my business at Home Depot, I don’t like bad ethics.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,My daughters lawn tractor quit on her…,"My daughters lawn tractor quit on her last week so my first thought was to check consumer reports. We were looking for something around $2000. After looking at the reviews we decided on a John Deere model E130. On the consumer reports website it has an option to shop and indicated that Lowe’s was one of the places that carried that model so I thought great I can use my Lowe’s credit card and get 5% off. I checked several locations near my daughters house and found the one in Abington showed one in stock. I live about 30 miles from Abington so I figured I would call to confirm as it suggests on the Lowe’s website. I called the Abington store and went through the recorded prompts to get to the correct department. The phone rang several times and no one answered so it went back to the recorded department list. I went through this about 5 times with no answer in that department so the next time I chose the option to speak to an associate with the same results no answer after 2 more tries. Ok one more try I went through the automated department selection and chose the self pick up option and finally I got a live person and I explained my situation and she agreed to help. She told me that she would not be able to physically check to see if they actually had it, which is the main reason for me to call. She check her computer and said that showed 1 however that’s bad she said because that was most likely the display model so I asked can’t you sell the display model and was told no I asked then what do you do with them and was told they recycle them through the system.

Usually shopping at Lowe's hasn't always been a good experience, because they are rude and I feel I'm an inconvenience as a shopper to them. So thank you Mike, I found the nice employee Kim",0,5
Lowe's Companies,Ordered a shed online two weeks ago,Ordered a shed online two weeks ago. Then just received an email that my order was cancelled. When we ordered the shed our closest store had 3 in stock. We have been trying to get a hold of customer service to no avail. Waited on the phone for over two hours to get hung up on.

Since I drive a Kia soul, I wasn't going to pick it up! I have been trying to verify the stated delivery ever since, for a week now! No one at Lowe's has a clue where or if my appliances will be delivered! Then last night I get an automated call that they'll be here by 4:30! Not sure WHAT they're bringing! The staff at the chesterfield store were rude and condescending and had no regard for the fact that I have a $35000 kitchen remodel that is scheduled around installing the appliances, at this point!

By the 1st of the next month I had called twice to check on the status, both times being told it has been bumped back. Then by the third call I was told they may never get it.

The online system said it would be available in 3-7 days, which was great news since every other store had a back order on the dishwasher until mid July. On 6/26 I decided to call customer service to see when I could pick up the machine as nothing had been sent to me. I was informed that the my item had come in damaged and a claim was put in to the manufacturer but NO replacement had been ordered. I was told that they had no way of knowing this occurred and someone from shipping and receiving SHOULD HAVE called me. Ok..still need a dishwasher, so we order again. Get the same 3-7 day timeframe and Lowes online indicated would be ready for pick up in 6 days..GREAT..except that today was day 6 and the date changed today, to add 3 more days and no explanation from anyone. I should have just waited for Home Depot or Best Buy to get them in stock. Lowes is big on cancelling online orders without notification apparently, as they have done this to me before. I'm never doing business with Lowe's again, they have made a loyal Home Depot customer out of me!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I will not buy from Lowes again,"If I could give Lowes in Bartonsville in PA a lower review than a 1 Star i would. They do not care about their customers what so ever. Nema the store manager “according to her” is in capable of helping. I Am building my deck out of composite materials. I ordered everything online. I followed up several times because The status online after the first week said ether “order received” or “in process”. I was assured everything was received and ready to ship except for the galvanized pieces. They were on back order. I totally understand that. So i made sure I rented the auger and made sure the holes were drilled. That way when the concrete came in we can start immediately. Only two things arrived. A umbrella and my four cushions. Awesome. The delivery dates for the big material came and nothing showed. I called Lowes and spoke to customer service. She told me the concrete was suppose to come on the 29th (it was the 28th when I called). Great it’s still coming. When I asked about the composite decking, railing and privacy fencing for the deck they told me it was ordered but to see when it was suppose to come I would have to call the manufacturer. So I called the manufacturer. They told me the only thing ordered was the privacy fencing. They have no record of anything else. Before I was able to ask when the fencing would arrive she told me that the fencing was already canceled by Lowes but there was no notes. So of course I was upset. I called Lowes back and like always there are no managers available. So I asked again if the concrete was coming on the 29th (the next day) because that was the most important part because we already dug the holes. She assured me it was coming. 29th came and no concrete. 30th came and no concrete. Today, July 1st still no concrete. I call up the specific Lowes that was supposed to be delivering it and they told me that it was on the truck ready to go and somebody name Christine from the Lowes in Bartonsville canceled it and they took it off the truck. I am beyond furious now. I called back the Bartonsville Lowes and they had no idea why it was canceled. I told them that instead of me redoing my entire order online I wanted to work with someone who would make sure the order was done right and I would receive my order. I didn’t want another two weeks to go by and they would cancel my stuff again. I finally get the “manager of the store” Nema. She tells me that She will get me someone who can order my stuff online and she will personally make sure I get a delivery date. I tell her OK that’s great is there anyway I can get the concrete sooner. She tells me no it could take at least two weeks. I explain to her that I already had holes dug and I need a concrete sooner. She tells me there’s nothing she can do to help me. So I ask her, since there isn’t anything you can do to help me get the concrete sooner can you please financially help me out because this is a huge inconvenience and pushes my deck project farther into the hot summer. She told me she could give me a 5% discount. I then asked her if that is 5% on top of the military discount I was getting. She told me absolutely not. It’s one or the other. I had to choose and there was nothing else she could do. She refused to call another store to see if I could get it sooner, she refused to give me a truck for free so I could pick it up my self (67 80lb bags) She wouldn’t do anything. She was extremely unprofessional and rude. She even hung up on me in the end. I am disgusted with what is happening. I will be calling Lowes customer service to see if there is anything I can do. If they won’t do anything I will make sure I never shop there again. I also will make sure I share this story everywhere I can. It is disgusting what they are doing.",0,1

It is now wed. No call no vanity. Another 43 minutes on hold to let them know I wanted the whole order returned and I was told I needed to call the original store that hung up on me 4 times to get it returned. No!

I live outside of Memphis and our numbers are rising fast. I have tried three times to use curbside pickup at this store and every time was never successful. Lowe’s advertises how they care about their customer and employee safety and I find this claim false. When you pull into a pickup slot and call, enter the extension they quickly return you to the main menu or hang up on you. I used the app to check in and apparently that doesn’t work either. Every time I have had to go into the store. I wouldn’t have a problem except most employees don’t wear mask. There were six people behind the counter and only one wearing a mask.When I asked why I was having such a problem with curbside pickup, they need to quit advertising it. I said I don’t have any problems at any other stores like Home Depot and I was told that I needed to take my business to Home Depot. When the girl behind the counter went to get my order off the shelf, she was looking in the wrong place and I was told I was wrong even though I was looking at it. She finally found it and it was right where I was looking.It took 24 hours before the internet order was ready for pickup and two hours to pickup in store. Store #1721",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Blue Star Juniper Patio Trees Nightmare!,"I purchased 2 Blue Star Juniper Patio Trees in the store at the end of April, 2020. The trees were delivered & planted the first week of May, 2020. Within 3 weeks time I noticed large areas of brown/dead needles on each tree. I researched online & discovered the trees had spruce spider mites The first course of action was to spray each tree a couple of times a week with a hard spray from the hose to try to remove the spider mites. After 2 weeks and 6 hose-sprays, I checked & the spider mites were still there. Next my online research said to spray weekly with Neem Oil. I started the spraying & this week was the 2nd week for spraying with the Neem Oil. When I looked deeper inside each tree I discovered the entire insides of both trees were completely brown with dead needles! Also the lovely blue/green color of the trees had now disappeared as a result of the Neem Oil treatment. The tree color was a plain green. I wrote to the Lowe's Customer Care email explaining everything last week but didn't get a response. Today I went into the store with my receipt & copies of all documents including my receipts for everything as well as pictures showing the tree infestation. I had paid $100.00 for a landscaper to plant the trees in addition to $34.10 for the Neem Oil. Each tree was $149.00 & delivery was $65.00 for a total for the trees of $387.05. In total I had spent $521.15 for the 2 trees so far. I would recommend never to buy this type of tree without thoroughly inspecting it first in the store! Luckily, the Assistant Manager was able to give me a full refund but I will never buy this type of tree again. Because of the very tight grouping of the needles on this tree, it is nearly impossible to see any damage or infestation unless one parts the tightly knit branches & looks inside. Otherwise, there is no way to see any problem unless it appears on the outside like it did within 3 weeks time.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Return Policy,"I ordered a generator and picked it up from this store. I put gas and oil in it because that's what you do with a generator in order for it to run. I realized it was not powerful enough for what I needed it for so I called on two different occasions to find out the return policy. Both times the women I spoke with told me I could bring it back within 30 days of when it was billed to my CC card which was when I picked it up. I brought it back 3 weeks after I picked it up. I told the woman at the return counter that it was not powerful enough so she must have figured out that I have to have put gas and oil in it. She told me I just need to bring it in and they would credit my card. I asked if it needs to be in the original box, which I had in my truck, and she said no. As I was bringing it in, a manager came out and told me they would not take it back because it was used. OF COURSE IT WAS USED. HOW WOULD I KNOW IT WAS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH. I called their 1-800 and was told the requirement to bring something back that required gas to run is to bring it back within 30 days and in the same package with no gas or oil in it. Then she did a little more research and told me that their policy did state that it could not have had gas in it. WAIT...WHAT...HOW IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO KNOW IF THE PRODUCT EVEN WORKS UNLESS YOU RUN IT?!?! And, if this is their policy, why did I have to waste so much time being told I could bring it back, bringing this insufficient thing back to the store, going through the return process, waiting for someone to bring a flatbed to my truck to unload and having to unload it myself before I was told they won't tack it back? I will be going to Home Depot from now on. BTW...The only reason I gave lowe's one star is because I can't put zero stars. Yes, I know I did not capitalize their name. From now on, I am shopping at Home Depot only.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,To whom it may concern,"To whom it may concern: (BUYERS BEWARE) I hope everybody is aware that Lowe’s has a new policy that they do not tell anyone about. (Salem, VA) There are some things that Lowe’s won’t let you return even if you have a receipt and the customer should have been notified the day of purchase from cashier. Lowe’s should be able to flag product to make cashier aware product cannot be returned. If you lose your receipt, you can not even get store credit.

Lowe's Companies,#Lowes is the worst company to deal…,"#Lowes is the worst company to deal with!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!! Purchased an expensive washer and dryer set in December of 2019. The day before our delivery, we were notified that they sold the washer out from under us and had to order another one. On delivery day, they dryer was broken. They came out and provided us with a replacement. Two days later scheduled deliver for the first 3 hour time slot...showed up 6 hours late. Then they failed to provide us the last $75.00 rebate we were supposed to get. And while the person I was speaking with about all these issues, he tried selling me a refrigerator!!!After contacting them in March in regards to the gift card, Corona occurred so obviously there was other more important things than a gift card. Fast forward to three weeks ago, the washer begins making an metal grinding sound at the end of the cycle. We do everything we were supposed to and called for service. Service was scheduled for yesterday. They never show. We call them back and they give us the phone number of the company that was providing the service. We call them and they inform us that they stopped doing warranty work at the beginning of Corona. My husband contacts the store and speaks with the Appliance manager, Fred. He informs him that he is going to credit our debit card for the gift card amount. He also says he will contact service department directly. He leaves a message because the hold time was too long. He says he’ll call my husband back. I get home from work at 7:00pm and they haven’t called. I call over there and speak with Fred, who was extremely rude. I than asked to speak with the store manager. He of course wasn’t in so I spoke with the assistant manager, Devon. He informs me that they will work on it today to figure out what the issue is along with advising Tom, the store manager of the issues. He states he will have Tom call my husband with an update. I ask for the district manager’s name and I’m told that they don’t have that information. Today, the store manager never calls my husband. I call when I get home and am told they have no update. The store manager isn’t in by the time I got done work so when asked if they attempted to contact service I was told they did last night, which we already knew. So technically they did absolutely nothing. And the only thing Decon kept staying is “you have to contact service.” When explained we have both done that and still nothing, he didn’t know what to tell me. So currently I have a washer that, while can be used, makes an extremely loud sound that scares our dogs and us. #LowesVoorheesNJ has done NOTHING to help us in getting the product THEY sold us fixed. Do yourself a favor and go buy your appliances at Home Depot! #Lowes doesn’t care about their customers. They take your money and sell you a faulty product then you have to jump through hoops to get it repaired!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Over promising and under delivering,"My boyfriend and I wanted to order a dishwasher during the memorial weekend sale. We had initially shopped at Home Depot but noted the same model wasn’t going to be delivered until mid July. My boyfriend looked around and noted the Lowe’s near our house has ability to deliver by June 16th. We deliberately went to Lowe’s over Home Depot which we had a pleasant experience with because we thought they had the inventory to deliver. Come June 16th, the dishwasher never came but a phone call did (on the day of promised delivery) to tell us that they are back ordered and the dishwasher won’t arrive until mid July. My boyfriend and i desperately wanted a dishwasher and went with Lowe’s that gave us the false impression that they were going to meet their promised delivery. On a separate occasion, I bought a succulent plant for a June 27th birthday fromLowe’s online for an in-store pick up, the system promised for a June 26th availability but then on June 26th when i called, it was pushed back till June 30th. Now I have no gift to give on that birthday which i wished I would know earlier so I can shop somewhere else. Lowe’s should invest in their logistics data update system for a better real time update to their inventory or how they are managing their deliveries. I’ve scrolled through all the one star reviews and noted I echoed the same sentiments around Lowe’s over promising and under deliver. It’s okay to report an out our stock status than blatantly letting customers buy something that they needed only to find out they are not getting delivered.",0,1

No one would answer the phone. So, called “customer care”, after waiting for 30 minutes or so, I was told the store is waiting on assembly crew and they’ll be at the store only on Monday. The person said I’d get a call on Monday. I got a call on Wednesday or Tuesday from the store saying the grill is no longer available. I tried asking the associate how is that they would sell the inventory 4 or 5 days I placed an order. She said she don’t know. Today (Saturday) i called “customer care” again to give my feedback. After 40 minutes of waiting, the person answered my call was like - ok, I can’t do anything. First, please change that name from “customer care” to “customer, so what?” Or “customer? We give a f$&!” . I used to compare prices at Home Depot n Lowe’s before buying something. Here on, I don’t give sh$& about pricing, I’ll not step in to Lowe’s again.

Lowe's Companies,"Great merchandise, poor poor poor estimates!","I live within 2 miles of our local Lowes. Being a small, rural community I was thrilled to have a large store like Lowe’s come to our community, one stop shop. Although the merchandise is great DO NOT purchase anything that has to have someone to come out and measure and tell you what you need. We’ve been putting Pella windows in the house a couple at a time and we were just finishing up with our last two this spring. We also planned to replace two small rectangular basement windows, but did not feel they needed to be Pellas since they’re in a basement. The Pellas ran around $1500. We were actually going to do the last two but when we got the estimate from the man who was here it was $3600 for the two basement wi Dow’s and the one Pella.. When we questioned why two small, rectangular basement windows would cost $2000, (when they’re on websites for all box stores between $250 and $300) we were told that the windows had to be cut out of the cement block foundation. We were told that the window wells on the inside that were oak (finished basement) would have to be replaced. When I question why they would be made into the cement block I was told that’s how they used to do it. (House built in 1982). When we found out that it was going to be so expensive, $1000 a window we went with one Pella and the two basement windows for a bill of $3600. A month later the installer came and took out the window and replaced it with the Pella then took out the two basement windows replaced them and was here less than two and a half hours. He did an awesome job. However, there was no cutting out of the cement, they were not into the foundation, no window wells had to be rebuilt, and what we ended up with was the $250 windows being put in and costing us $1000 each. When I emailed the man who had come and given me the estimate I explained that none of this had to happen like he had told us. A week later I got a response from HR, not the man who had done the estimate and was told that the estimate just said to replace the windows. I explained over and over again what we had been told would have to happen and it didn’t and I expected them to make it right. She continually repeated “I can understand your frustration, I can understand your frustration” , but yet did nothing about it. We aren’t sure if the man who made up the estimate just didn’t know they were not into the foundation, or if he was just trying to rip off a retired couple. So, so disappointed in Lowes.",0,1

We rescheduled, surprise, they never showed up on the day they said. We then called to figure out what happened, they lied to our faces and said we had never called/they had never agreed to set up a delivery date and that now our new delivery date would be another 2 weeks out (that's a month and a half since purchase). So after multiple 1-2hr customer service calls, I called to cancel my order. I was told I would receive a call 24-48 hours to confirm - I didn't. I did see that my status had changed online to returned. 4 Days later I see I received a refund on my credit card, however it wasn't the full amount I was charged. They refunded ONLY the washer and not the haul-away service. So here I am on another (30 mins so far) call in hopes they can do their job right and refund the full amount. In the meantime of when I requested the refund to today (about a week now), I was able to purchase a nicer and cheaper washer at Bestbuy - have it delivered, installed, and hauled away no problem. Unlike Lowe's customer service reps (who hang up every time I request a supervisor) Best buy's customer service is top-notch. Just go buy your appliances there and not at Lowes.

They refused to replace the fridge and repaired it by placing an ugly tape on the side of the fridge. Since then, any food that sits near the back part of the fridge freezes completely. I’ve lost eggs, My vegetables become mush and other foods are ruined. The ice maker shoots out ice every time you use and it gets all over my kitchen floor leaving wet spots that I step into if not cleaned properly. The shelves are flimsy and crack easily. I have lost one out of the three shelves in my freezer. The most important one, the middle, in which, they claim they cannot fix. So therefore, I barely can use the space in my freezer.

So I called them I still had the receipt for the last purchase when I used the card, the receipt also shows my MyLowes account # on it, they would not reimburse me with a new card with the 46.84 balance because they said I needed the original receipt when I bought the card. How many people actually would ever keep the original receipt when they buy a gift card from krogers or any place. I cannot believe they would not just check the balance on the card, my store receipt I kept from that day actually shows the card number and the balance left after I made the last purchase. I am truly disappointed in their policy. I would imagine no one ever gets another gift card to replace a lost one, or stolen and even been dumb like me and after throwing away the wrong card.

This is totally different then the last pick up i did. The other line was about 8 deep. Then a food delivery person showed up with a pizza and all operations stopped to figure out who ordered lunch. Oh and the delivery guy wasn't wearing a mask and nothing was said to him and no one in the lines were practicing social distancing. I left the store without my order because of all the scenarios going on and bought what i needed at a competitors that was much more organized. This was at the Havertown PA store #3169",0,1

As we on this page know, the money from UI doesn't show up when it's promised, but until it happened, I thought it was reliable. Well my payment bounced back twice so they cancelled my account because that is their policy under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES even COVID19 Pandemic!

Lowe's Companies,DO NOT order on-line for delivery of appliances,DO NOT order appliances on-line for delivery. I placed an order and was told by their on-line chat that I could change the delivery date. I called the store and told them I needed the delivery scheduled a week later. They said no problem and told me they would take care of it. Checked my order on-line and date was never changed. Called the store and they told me they could not do anything about it that I had to wait for their delivery service to contact me. The delivery service contacted me the night before the delivery and I told them I had to change the delivery date. They told me it had to be changed through Lowe's. I explained to them that Lowe's told me I had to contact them. She said sorry we can not change it. I have 2 large appliances coming to my DOOR STEP not even being delivered indoors on a day that I have no one to help move them in side. Really bad Customer Service also.

Not one person in the multiple people I’ve talked to have even uttered the words “I’m sorry”, only offered excuses or passed the buck to someone else who starts the whole lying and deflecting and not taking any responsibility process.

Lowe's Companies,This company is a circus!,"I went to the Chattanooga TN Gunbarrel Rd. Lowes #0425 and purchased a $2500.00 Samsung Fridge on 5-26-2020 with a promised delivery date of June 9 2020. June 9th came and went with no phone call or notification. After spending 35 minutes calling the store and no one answering I finally got through to the appliance dept. and was told delivery was changed to June 16th 2020 that the fridge was backordered from Samsung. June 16th came and went again with no phone call or notification. I went to the store this time and was told the Fridge still has not arrived from Samsung. I took matters into my own hands and got the Samsung Vendor phone number 1-844-415-1151 and gave them my PO#. They told me the fridge was delivered to the Lowes Appliance Distribution Center #3367 in Smyrna TN on June 11th 2020. I finally got a call from the appliance manager who told me he also called the ADC and yes the fridge is there and will be on the Monday June 22nd appliance truck to the store. Well guess what, it wasn't and after spending 62 minutes on the phone trying to get through to someone, my wife went to the store and was told the same song and dance about how delivery was changed to July 1st with no explanation. Im not the shut up and wait type of guy so once again I took the matter into my own hands. I got the phone number for the Special Order Sales dept. of the Lowe's ADC #3367 (1-615-751-5870) gave the friendly lady my PO# and was told ""yes the fridge is here however store 0425 was a dropped store and this along with several other appliances has to be shipped to the Atlanta ADC before being shipped to the stores"". She also had no ETA as to when this will take place. So, there you have it. My Samsung fridge has been sitting in Smyrna TN ( 1 1/2 hours away from me) since June 11 and is going to be shipped to Atlanta for God knows how long before it gets shipped to my store and finally delivered to me.

Lowe's Companies,Horrible Customer Service!!!,"On June 7, 2020 myself and my husband went in the Chattanooga Tennessee Gunbarrel Store to purchase a Refrigerator and a Stove. We spent over $3,000We were given a delivery date of 6/19/2020. Because I had not heard anything concerning the delivery I decided to call for delivery confirmation. I called for 2 hour straight choosing EVERY department they have and NO PICK UP! First, this makes no sense at all!!! I ended up driving to the store where I watch employees standing around, laughing and talking at the Customer Service Desk. Once I was able to get someone at the Customer Service Desk to assist me I was advised the Stove was in the stock room but the refrigerator had not come in. Then I was told the delivery date had been changed to 6/26/2020!!!! No call letting me know this! I requested to speak with Supervisor Steve Frazier. He said he would find out what was going on. He sent the guy up front Michael Devita, he is the one that took my order on 6/7. Michael proceeded to say Oh yea, your delivery date has been changed. I was very upset that a company like Lowes handles business so poorly.I said, since the stove is here have that delivered and we will wait on Frig. Michael proceeded to tell me the stove nor the refrig was delivered at their store. I said the customer service lady said the stove is here?!!!Michael said, let me go back to the back and speak with Noel Davis, the Manager over deliveries.Michael came back and said, Well, we have the stove and the refrig in the back. By this time I am furious!!!For over an hour everyone was placing the blame on everyone else. No one took responsibility.I stated then so my paid in full appliances can be delivered today as I was told on 6/7 right? Another 30 to 45 minutes I waited while your employees went back and forth to finally be told NO! The drivers said they are done for today. You will get your items tomorrow, which I did.Lastly, I paid extra for BOTH appliances to be carried off. Once the drivers brought the items in my home we were advised they did not have any room to take them off. The drivers said they would either be back that Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The appliances are sitting in my yard today, MONDAY 5:42 pm.This is totally unacceptable and will file a complaint with the BBB.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,No showed delivery of appliance,"Special ordered washer and dryer a month in advance at Lowe’s in Essex Vermont, with delivery date set. Day of delivery Lowe’s no showed without call. I called store and found out that my washer was on back order, this after a month earlier I had one reserved by sales which was coming in next day. Called store.... don’t waste your time... redirected or on hold for 40 minutes to an hour( multiple times) with the last call the lowes associate hung up on me when asked to speak to the store manager. Customer service for the Lowe’s corporation in general is also a joke don’t bother calling you’ll be redirected multiple times and they won’t resolve your issue. I was on hold or being redirected for at least an hour with the corporate customer service multiple times. The head of appliances At Lowe’s in Essex VT, had no answers to any questions and did not know why I was not called to cancel delivery, had no answer for why my order wasn’t ready after it was planned ahead a month. Had no foreseeable date to deliver already paid for product. I should’ve seen the lack of customer service when going to the Essex store to purchase washer and dryer, and waited in appliances department for well over 30 minutes. Terrible store customer service, terrible corporate customer relations, terrible execution of delivering paid for product on set delivery date. The end result is that Lowes is quite comfortable wasting your hard earned time in failed delivery dates and wasted time in non-productive phone conversations which are mostly waiting on hold. They must be doing well enough not to care. First terrible experience at Lowe’s but would never again or never recommend ordering appliances from them.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Don't waste your time at Lowes,"I did a big project through them and it was just one thing after another. Hands down homedepot is better, more organized and technically more advanced. This become super apparent when checking out and especially when you need to deal with customer service or returns. I had an order placed a month ago and the expected delivery date was 2 weeks later. After the delivery date had passed I started trying to figure out what was happening with the missing order. Checking online was no help as it simply displayed the original information and delivery date. Calling in you'll get sent around from person to person. I was told to contact the vendor directly. The vendor had no open POs for this store. Calling into Lowes I would be placed on hold for an hour just to be read the same details I was seeing online. It has been 2 weeks of this. I literally was on hold today and drove 30 minutes to the store. Was finally told that the PO to the vendor had not been made by corporate that they can't force corporate to send the PO to the vendor. This is 2 weeks after the item was meant to be delivered. Completely ridiculous, I had to cancel the order. There were other issues as well and after getting through this project I'm closing the lowes card and keeping my homedepot card, even tough HD is further from my home. Waste of effort.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,UPDATED review   -  One star is one too many for this…,"I am updating this review on Friday June 26th, four days after I posted a very negative review.I was contacted by a store manager form the closest Lowe's location to me. This surprised me since I was told that since I purchased through Lowe's.com, my interactions would online.The manager, Evan, was very accommodating and increased my refund to approximately 34% of the purchase price. And as I stated in the first review, the product is no longer available on Lowes.com (at least under the previous description). While I remain saddened by the smaller than promised area, I am grateful that Lowe's too steps to make it a better overall experience. One star is one too many for this experience. I ordered a 10' x 14' metal roofed gazebo through Lowes.com to replace a 10' x 12' cloth roofed gazebo which had ripped after 5 years. ( not purchased at Lowe's)The packages arrived on time and a week later, I had 2 hired helpers to construct the gazebo. I left once they were building it and came back to find that the structure is in fact 10'x10'! The base is listed 9.5'x9.5' with an exterior measurement of 10x14. This information was everywhere: on the website, on my packing slip, on my receipt, and on the order form. I had just paid $400 for 2 men to work 6 hours to build me a gazebo 40 square feet less than advertised. I was furious and tried to call immediately and since it was Sunday, got no where. The next day, while attempting to work remotely, I was on hold for 57 minutes before getting a rep who suggested I take it apart and Lowe's would come pick it up. I asked it they would pay the men to take it apart and then put up the new one she promised to exchange it for. Of course that was laughed off. I was told someone from upper management would call me in 24 hours. Someone did call 5 hours later and offered me a 10% refund. I explained that I was promised via their advertising that I was getting 140 square feet and in fact got 40 square feet less. That is 28.57% less than promised! 10% was not enough and I was told, someone else would contact me in 24 hours. That was Monday. No one called me. A look at the Lowes.com website showed a negative review for my product by someone who also raised the issue of misrepresenting the size of the product. During the week I attempted 3 more times to get through. After waiting 122 minutes on Friday, I got through to be told virtually the same thing after an additional 32 minutes with another rep. When I went back to the website I saw that my product, name, model number, serial number, etc was gone. No bad reviews, and no way to critique that product. I have wasted so much time and effort on this company who apparently does not care about their customers. I promised to blast them in every social media and to warn my friends and family to avoid this rip off company like the plague. I will never give this firm my business again.",0,4
Lowe's Companies,My boyfriend and I ordered a 200$ patio…,"My boyfriend and I ordered a 200$ patio set. We received a call yesterday confirming the delivery, saying that they would arrive between 5pm and 9pm. So today we waited for them to show up, and by 6pm nobody had called yet (we were told the drivers would call us 30 minutes in advance for the delivery) So we called Lowe’s to confirm that it would still be delivered today, and the associate confirmed that it would be there at 6:28 pm. Another hour passed, and it was now 7pm and we still hadn’t received a call from the drivers. We called Lowe’s again to confirm the delivery, but this time the woman said that they don’t deliver in our area, and it would be shipping through UPS. I’m extremely annoyed that we had our delivery confirmed through 2 different associates, just to be told that they don’t deliver in our area to begin with. Why did they even confirm a delivery time with us then? The only thing the manager told us was “Well the associate you spoke to shouldn’t have told you that.” We wasted our night waiting for this delivery, and then when I asked if they could do anything for us to make up for this inconvenience, I wasn’t even given an apology. I will not be ordering from this company again, and I am extremely disappointed.

Lowe's Companies,trying to contact Lowes for weeks,"I have been trying to contact Lowe’s Corp for months because of their Barbie doll manager in mountain Home AR who can’t tell the difference between a serial number and a telephone number.I purchase a product with a extended 4 yr warranty. Product failed after one use and I took it back to the store. Barbie, too busy polishing her nails and chewing bubblegum tells me after 45 min of dancing around doing absolutely nothing that there is nothing she can do because there is no serial number on the unit. I show her and go back and forth telling her, that is the serial number. Where do they get people like this? Are you freakin kidding me. What a waste of a person. So here I stand trying to contact Lowe’s Corp office and the manufacturer of the item and no one gives a crap. Funny how Home Depot has my exchanges in under 60 seconds with my pro acct and Lowe’s takes hours just to reject and months to try and contact. I am going out of my way to promote Home Depot and tell the Lowe’s story. Lowe’s is a piece of garbage company that no one should ever have to deal with",0,1

Moved over to carpet to get started there and the person was actually at their post. He could not however be bothered to even get up to show me what I was asking for. He then just walked off. Any further questions just went unanswered. I have never been this disappointed at Lowe's. Over the last several years I have spent quite some money with them. Will not go back. The only friendly face was a cashier, who told me that mornings were not staffed fully. Most associates would be there mid day, when all the customers actually go shopping. I picked the morning ( 8 am ) specifically to avoid crowds and have more time making selections for such a big project. Am calling their customer number as I am writing this.

Lowe's Companies,Awful customer service!,Awful customer service! In store and through the 800 number. When I was in the store I approached a Lowe’s associate standing alone at a register. He had a personal wallet in his hand and I thought he might be trying to locate the owner of the wallet but after standing there for five minutes after I had asked him for assistance I had noticed that he was using his credit card to make an online purchase using the Lowe’s register screen for a personal purchase. It seems that I had interrupted his online shopping and it was inconvenient for him to help me at the moment. Only once he was done with his purchase did he direct his attention to me. I asked him for help with installing one of the shower kits that they sell and he immediately replied to me we don’t do that. I looked at him and said you don’t even know which one I was asking about. He did not seem to care. Another day I tried another guy. He said that I would need to pay $35 for a detail and somebody would come out and give me an estimate on the install of the shower kit. I paid my $35 and went home. After a week went by somebody called me and asked me about a service that I had not wanted which was a shower door install and not the tub to shower conversion like I had paid for. The person on the phone said oh we don’t do that. Another week went by and nothing nobody called. I called Lowe’s and spent 45 minutes on hold.

Lowe's Companies,Horrible Customer Service,"I am appalled at how terrible your Customer Service is. You should be ashamed to be a business that allegedly serves its customers. I have had several issues with you over the past month, but the problems began long before that. How do you have curbside pickup when there is no answer on the number you are instructed to call and no Lowe's associate outside? How do you change stores for store pickup without the approval of your customer? How do you load a White LG Frontload washer onto your truck, but load a champaign pedestal washer? It is appalling that each one of these things happened to me within the last 2 weeks. this is the worst display of Customer Service I have ever experienced. In my opinion, you might as well close your doors and allow another business that actually cares about their customers to fill the void. You are a pathetic excuse for a company. As a business owner myself, if I ever treated Customers the way that you do, I would not have a business. It is shameful to see.It is interesting to see the number of 1-star reviews that you have received as a company. It is like you just said screw-it to Customer Service.

Lowe's Companies,The worst experience of my life,"The worst experience of my life. Impossible to get through on the phone. I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes yesterday, and 35 minutes each and every other time. Bought a Samsung refrigerator and a 5 year service agreement. The refrigerator started failing in April 2020. Totally unprofessional service company. Would not return calls. Many steps till resolution. Same problem the next month. Different service company. Three visits to fix. Had to keep emptying out the fridge before each service, wait 48 hours to defrost. Last straw yesterday when the freezer failed. After the 11/2 hour wait, a rep said they would buy back the unit and reimburse for food loss. Lowe’s actually called today to confirm the refund but refused to give me the $750 for food loss unless I filled out three forms, one for each occurrence. Who keeps receipts? I pay with cash. Absolutely would not budge. This company does a remarkable job of keeping a customer from speaking with anyone in authority. I finally got a corporate number but I have been thrown back into the never-ending loop of being on hold. If anyone has a way to contact someone in corporate, let me know.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Protection Plan Ripoff…,"We experienced a power outage during a thunderstorm in June 2020. When the power came back 3 days later, our 2-year-old Whirlpool washing machine was dead. An electrician told us that we had a power surge. We went to Lowes to replace and they told us that we had the 3-year Assurance plan and to file a claim since it was covered. I called the service number (1-hour hold) and explained the situation to the rep and she set up an appointment for service. The appliance serviceperson came and inspected the washer and told me that a board was burnt out and required replacing. He would order the part and would come back in a week. The next day I got a call from the serviceperson stating that the protection plan office refused to authorize the part purchase. When I called the office, I was told that although a power surge is covered, lightning is considered an act of god and is not covered. I told her that my house did not have a lightning strike. She said that the repair report said that the surge was caused by a lightning strike. I told her that it is impossible for the repair person to say why the surge occurred, only attest to the damage caused by the surge. She could not comprehend that so I asked to talk to her supervisor. She told me that he was not available that day, but could return my call the next day. She stated that neither she nor her supervisor had the authority to reverse the decision anyway. I then asked to speak to someone that had that authority and she said that they don't take calls, only the reps do. How screwed up is that system!!! And as expected, the supervisor never did return my call.So, we purchased another washer and another appliance from Lowes, but did not, and will not ever take the extended warranty. They are an unethical organization with a dysfunctional system.",0,1

While I was there, I saw at least fifteen employees without face masks or wearing them incorrectly. There is NO point in making customers wear face masks if the employees are not doing it. ALL of the employees who were doing this were under the age of 25. They obviously don't care if they put others at risk.One of the employees in the lumber department who I asked for help wouldn't even look at me. I was polite and he acted like he was doing me a favor. I'm Caucasian and I'm sure it had something to do with his indifference toward me. The employees here of all races need some sensitivity training. The young man who waited on me was also NOT wearing a face mask.Management needs to do their job and train the employees properly.",0,1

When the Lowe’s guys showed up they were very nice and told me the fridge had dents on it and asked what I wanted to do. I asked them to take the fridge and I will get another delivered. Called Lowe’s and talk to Nicole in delivery and she didn’t care at all that my fridge had dents or how long I was going to have to wait for the next delivery. She got me schedule for a week later. Did you know that Lowe’s now has third party delivery?! I found out yesterday when my fridge was delivered. Was told by Lowe’s my delivery was between 8-11am. Nope it wasn’t until after 3 pm. The man knocked on my door didn’t even introduce himself and said where’s the fridge we are taking and proceeded into my house as I went outside to look at the new fridge to make sure no dents I could hear the man dragging my old fridge across my hardwood floors. Then when he got the fridge outside he continued to drag it across my driveway and leaving black marks everywhere. My new fridge was half way sitting on cardboard and rocks in my driveway. They pushed my new fridge across my driveway which is rocks before getting a dolly. When they finally got to my house. The fridge didn’t fit. They found this out after the dent my frame work around my door. They took my door off the hinges to get the fridge in. The main guy was yelling at the other guys and saying cuss words in front of my children. When the fridge finally made it in my house they continue to push it and not even use the dolly. The put a hole in my flooring scratched up more hardwood and left marks all over my floor. Didn’t even get an apology. The man placed my fridge in my kitchen and said due to covid we can’t open the fridge and install. Excuse me?! I paid to have this . So he put the handles on but not after scratching my new fridge. They had no idea what they were doing. I told them to get out of my house because I was done. The man was like no I can do this, I said leave I am good. They left garbage in my driveway and yard. So after all that I have a 2000 dollar fridge that has dents and scratches. A hole in my flooring. Scratches in my hardwood. Dents in my front door frame work and not to mention they almost left door being able to close after they are the ones who took my door off. WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!

This was over a holiday weekend in 100F desert temps. We lost a lot of meats and foods that we stocked up on with the pandemic. Called Lowes and was hung up on. Tried to reach the store manager and was again hung up on. Finally reached out to corporate and they were just as bad. Dealt with Allen Johnson who always seemed out of the office and was passed off to Lynn Lowes. We wanted to return the product and compensation for lost food. Of course after several weeks of No refrigerator, the cost of eating out, and lost food... we finally got the manufacturer over to replace part of the refrigerator... (after a couple of missed appointments and a mysterious part that was ordered and was lost). Still trying to deal with Lowes as we do not want this faulty appliance and want to return it along with getting some compensation for the lost food. Allen and Lynn were very poor in even attempting to resolve any issues. I am still trying to follow up wit them and they are not returning calls or emails.

I waited all day until 2pm with now phone call. I attempted to call the store several times with no answer. Finally got through to customer service about 7 p.m. that evening and was told it was under my old phone which I haven't had for at least 6 years. I questioned this as to how Rebecca phoned me the previous night for delivery set up. I asked to speak to a manager who was at lunch. I asked for a return call. I ended up calling back at 830p.m. before the store closed at 9. I was told that actually my refrigerator was sold to someone else by a new associate who has been double selling! The morning manager will call me after 8 am with an update. No call so I called back about 11 am. Was not given to manager but to Rebecca who said my sales associate would call back. He wanted to sell me a different brand and I was done. I have wasted a days work and at least 2.5 hours on the phone. What a joke. I asked to have the credit mailed to my address. Received that on June 16. I was charged $1139.09 and the credit was for $1032.62. Not only no refrigerator but I guess they needed a tip! Actually was the warranty I had purchased that wasn't going to be refunded me. Good thing I paid attention!!!! Lost my business forever and a few of my friends too.,0,1

So I called to get further information.....to clarify lowes sold me a product they did not have and did not know if they would ever have back in stock. The july 2nd delivery date was another lie as they had no further information of when or if the refrigerator would be in stock. I was transferred to the delivery department ...who would not answer the phone. I called back later that day as I wanted a refund as I needed a refrigerator 15 days ago, I spoke with a Mark and he was unsympathetic, simply canceled my order, no apologies. When I asked when my money would be returned he stated lowes had never taken a payment....however as I informed him he was inaccurate as they had taken a payment 4 days prior. He simply stated it will be 15days and hung up. So Lowes fraudulently sold me a refrigerator. Wanted me to waited over 30days with no indication of the ability to restock the refrigerator and then wanted me to wait 15 more days for the payment to be resubmitted me.I will never set foot in another lowes, this company should be ashamed of there online order service and customer service and will never receive another penny from me.I do want to say that I did speak with two ladies who I am sorry were simpathic and nice to speak with, however I do not remember there names.

Wrong size, color, and style. Then got dicked around for week. Come to find out, the one I ordered was sitting at the store assigned to deliver it the whole time. Whomever loaded the truck is illiterate. Big god damn labels with my name on it, special order, etc. Helen Keller could have seen it. Then I order a dishwasher that of course no one stocks, they only stock stainless models so that if you are in a pinch they get you for another 100-150 more for the finish. Utter BS marketing tactics. About a week later it shows ready for delivery, but the wrong phone number, again. I call the store it was supposed to be coming from, got some woman bumpkin who had no idea what the hell she was doing. I had to repeat myself a number of times. Finally got fed up and emailed CEO again. I get his Exec Customer Service team, again, because he is a gutless wonder who hides. Amazingly the dishwasher shows up the same day at another, closer store. Today I go to get two simple items and as usual, one is not in stock. Whomever orders for the local store has an IQ of 10. Never, ever, have I gone and gotten 100% of what I need as something is always out. COVID is a BS excuse. So I get in line, which for longer than COVID, has been a slow, disastrous process. Today had three lines open which is more than normal, still took almost 10 minutes to get the customer in front of me checked out and then as I walk up next, the girl turns off her light and says I am going on break. I lost it, slammed the item down on her register, and said F this place. Another cashier has the gall to say, sir, what's the matter so I turned around and unloaded on them. I then call the manager and get a douchecanoe named Chris who was worthless. It son wonder this store sucks, their entire culture and management are incompetent.

So, my decision was based on the date that I would get my item. I only received a confirmation email and nothing more. I tried to track my order on the store website, but it only showed the status ""in progress"" and never gave any update on the order status. I called customer service to check on my order, it was a awful, no information about the item, they just asked me to wait for an email Informing me about the right date for pickup. I said that I only ordered the microwave at Lowe’s because of the pickup date and I really needed it in two days. I never received any notice from them...no email, no text... nothing! We called customer service several times and always was given horrible service. They hung up on us 2 times. I ordered it on 05/21 for pickup on 06/04. On 06/09 I decided to cancel my order because I had not received the microwave and they were still not able to tell me when I would get it. They said that I would receive an email confirming the purchase cancelation but so far no communication. We are totally disappointed, especially because Lowe’s was my husband’s favorite store. He said it when he called customer service but they didn't care about this. Total nonsense and waste of time!",1,1

However, I got a gift card for my birthday for Lowe’s and I drive to the one on Marietta Hwy Marietta GA today to return 2 trellis that I had purchased last week. The customer service at returns named Julie made no eye contact and I asked her if she could put the refund back on my gift card, she said “I haven’t even got to that part yet” and did my return and gave me my receipt with a merchandise card and did not make eye contact and handed it saying “here you go”. Then I was looking for trellis and couldn’t find anyone for help. I also needed gutters and asked a guy he sent me to isle 52 and didn’t even direct me so I didn’t know which way to get to isle 52 because all I could see at the end was isle 16. I almost walked all over the store. Then when I checked out my items I realized the women charged me 12:98 for plant which was clearly labeled 11.98. When I told her that she sent me back to customer service and I had to stand for 13 min for the refund of $1.00 and the women gives me a merchandise credit for $1.00. So I have to come back to Lowe’s to spend that $1.00.

Lowe's Companies,WORST Experience Ever! Problem is still not resolved.,"My husband and I recently purchased an outdoor dining set off of Lowes.com. We have been working from home the past few months (much like the rest of the world), and we were excited to have a place to work outside now that we are entering the summer months. We ended up receiving the chairs first (which were in ok condition) and then the table last. The table that we received was significantly damaged with dings and a major dent on the top. We called Lowes customer service, and after waiting on the phone for an hour and a half, we were able to schedule a time to have the old table picked up and a replacement delivered the following week. The night before the delivery, we received a confirmation phone call telling us the time-frame in which we could expect the new table to arrive at our home. Imagine our surprise when the day came and went without receiving the table. We didn’t even get a phone call or anything to explain why the table never arrived. We had to call the customer service line AGAIN and wait on the phone for an hour AGAIN to get answers. Apparently there were no more of the tables in stock at the store we received the original table from, which is why we never got a delivery. Why the heck we even got a call to confirm a delivery time for something that wasn’t in stock is still a mystery to me. After another hour of being passed back and forth between departments, we finally worked it out where the table was coming in the following week, and we should receive it then. To add insult to injury during this exchange, we heard the manager say that we were a pain in his ass on the phone. He didn’t hang up fast enough. Would you believe that the same thing happened? We received a call confirming the delivery and didn’t get the table. We had to call customer service AGAIN and waste two more hours of our time trying to figure out a solution to this issue. We were beyond frustrated and finally just asked for a credit for the entire purchase price of the table and we would just keep it. We were tired of the back and forth, and we didn’t want to be a “pain the ass” anymore. It was beyond disappointing to hear that we wouldn’t be able to get a credit and keep the table. We have wasted hours of time dealing with the least helpful group of people we have ever interacted with in our lives, we have altered our schedules to be available for deliveries that never showed up, we have been treated rudely by Lowes employees and we were still willing to keep the trashed table of a set that we paid $1,300 for... and we couldn’t get a credit? Thank you for that. We are so disgusted at this rate, that we just scheduled to have the table AND chairs picked up to be returned for a full refund. The problem with this is that we have no faith anyone is going to follow through on this. We are afraid that we are going to be stuck with these items and that we are going to be forced into paying the $1,300, because no one seems to care about customer satisfaction at Lowes. It has taken over a month to even get this far, and I feel like it is the company’s strategy to beat their customers into submission by dragging out instances like this until they too tired to deal with it anymore. That really, really sucks. There is no other word for it.This is our last ditch effort to reach out and see if we can get adequate assistance regarding this matter. My husband and I have given a lot of our hard earned money to this company, and the treatment we have received doesn’t equate to what we have invested into solving this issue that should have been handled the right way the first time. The saddest thing about this is I don’t think that this is going to get us anywhere… please prove me wrong Lowes!",0,1

And continued to say she can’t give me a sale without seeing it. I said, here, here’s my email of the add. She told me that doesn’t matter. New manager, finally took care of it.

I said none of the above, I want it installed in the kitchen. I was then informed that would be an additional cost, and that installation needs to be facilitated by Lowes. Called Lowes and spoke with a customer service representative that was unable to assist me, and was told to expect a call from a manager. 12 hours go by, no call from a manager. Called the store again and spoke to the scheduling and installation department, and Jackie said ""I know it's not clear on the website, but you will have to pay the additional $159 if you want us to install it, unless you want to install it yourself."" I asked if she was kidding and requested that the install fee be waived since the information was not made clear on the website when I placed the order, nor was there any information about a third party delivery or the need to take extra steps to facilitate installation post-delivery. Was advised to call the toll-free corporate number. Was on hold for 49 minutes.

Lowe's Companies,Bad lawnmower experience.,"Just wanted to share an experience we had recently at Lowe’s in Stony Brook. ￼My friend ￼just bought a house in Mastic and we needed a lawnmower. I’m a little older, so I asked my friend if she would consider upgrading to a self-propelled model since I was going to be the one to mow the lawn‘s. ￼￼And she agreed. We both went to Lowe’s, told the rep in the lawnmower department what we wanted, he put it in our cart ...we paid for it and off we went. It’s sat outside for two days until I was able to unpack it. After putting it together I mowed the back 40. I was completely exhausted. I went to the front yard and got a third of the way through and was completely blown. I’ve never had a lawnmower before, so I didn’t know what to expect. ￼I looked underneath the lawnmower to see where the gears were that made it self propelled ￼and there were none. None of the wheels moved on their own. It wasn’t until we went online that we found out that they had sold us a push mower. I had already used it but when we called Customer Service, they said we could turn it in for a new one, as long as we emptied the gas, and we did not have to bring the box back fortunately, because the day I unpacked it, they picked up cardboard in our area and the box went out. Went back to the store, easy exchange and they gave me a new one. A photo of the box which I will include will show you how it came. I sent the photo to my friend and when she saw the shape of the box she said, it’s used, bring it back. She can be very skeptical and I can be very trusting. I brought the box home and two days later again opened it up to put it together. We first noticed there was no oil bag in the box. She said it was used. I took it out of the box and on the bottom there was what looked like an oil stain on the bottom of the box. ￼She said it was used. I said you just don’t trust anyone, do you? She said pull out the dipstick, and there was oil on it. While she was on the phone with Customer Service I said to myself, ￼let me at least smell the gas tank that way I’ll know if it was used because you can’t get rid of the smell of gas. And I open the gas cap and stuck my nose into a FULL TANK OF GASOLINE!! 😡😡 Needless to say, she was right, and I was wrong. I drove all the way home with a re-purposed lawnmower that they sold me as NEW AND AT FULL PRICE, with a full tank of gas, and then back to the store again with a full tank of gas. I didn’t empty it when I returned it because I wanted them to see that it was FULL.!! NO manager came to the front even though I saw the rep on the phone kind of talking so I couldn’t hear her, and a young man came to take the one I had and exchange it for another. As he walked away I called him back and said, make sure you bring me a brand new one that’s not wrapped up in packing tape!!! He did, I brought it home, and at the moment it seems to work fine. And it was brand new. That being said, I will never shop at Lowe’s again. I will be a Home Depot customer for life and I will tell everyone who wants to know about my experience there. ￼￼Very disappointed, and just wanted to share this with everyone who could read it!￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Lowe’s blows!!🤬",0,1

One time, we waited over an hour and we just left, even after talking to a manager to send someone over. We finally got the floor installed on 5/15/20, after my husband had to go to the store a day before to get some materials that they hadn't bother to send. The people that came to install the floor were the most unfriendly people I have ever encountered. It was actually kind of scary. We have been trying to get the same floor in other bedrooms and we haven't even been able to get an estimate. I finally called the store manager since talking to the person in charge of flooring hasn't worked out, he was rude and sounded like he couldn't care less.

The new cabinet was a disappointment, the doors were crooked, the screws were loose in the drawer glides, the rear panel is a flimsy pressboard piece and is only 3/8 thickness. I had to modify this cabinet with my own added stiffeners at the corners and perimeters.What cheap shoddy workmanship, glue, staples and NO screws. Now for the WORST!!! I was appalled at the lack of masks being worn by the EMPLOYEES in the midst of this PANDEMIC,the employees even had the nerve to come close up to me with no mask and talk close up. I hate going to Lowes and risking my health. I will be very hard pressed to visit this Lowes in Mount Airy,NC also due to the overwhelming majority of patrons not wearing masks and acting as if the PANDEMIC is over with.",0,2

Lowe's Companies,Worst experience ever!!!,"I'll never deal with Lowes again. I went online to order some blinds. The only store that had what I needed was in Florence KY(45 minutes ONE WAY). I chose the option to pick them up b/c it was $89 for truck delivery. I called the store w/ a question & the Customer Serv. lady said it could be several days before order was ready but we could come pick out the blinds ourselves & just take them to the CS desk to check out. So my husband goes there & after waiting 20 minutes for someone to help him, he's told that they had NONE of the blinds at the store even though it said there were 7 in stock with the aisle AND bay number!! So I called again to talk to CS & the 2nd woman I talked to told me to call a different Cust. Care Dept. & rattled off the number. I asked her to repeat it & she actually said ""OH MY GOD!!"" I guess I was writing too slow for her. I was so shocked I couldn't say anything. Long story short, I went online the next day to order some different blinds from another Lowes b/c it said 15 in stock. I actually called the store to confirm that was correct & she said yes they had enough to fill my order. So after two days of waiting & not getting an email, I called the store get the status. I talked to Jake & he said he'd check & call back. Unfortunately, AGAIN the internet & CS rep. were wrong!! They too, had NONE!! I have to commend Jake at the Springdale store for being so helpful & nice and calling me back within an hour. More employees need to be like him.They do no keep their website up to date. Some of the employees are rude & not very knowledgeable. I'll be doing my shopping at Home Depot in the future. I've never had any trouble ordering from them.",0,1

What terrible service!! Lowe's has straight out lied to me about the three appliances that I purchased from this store. I had to pay the dishwasher installer additional to the additional fee from Lowe's and he stated that it was on Lowe's for not asking what kind of plumbing was in the home. They have told me that they had my washing machine and tagged it for my delivery on various dates only to be told today that I was ""told"" it would be another several weeks and hung up on. Delivery needs to get a handle on their information and learn to communicate with one another. I asked to speak to a manager and was told to hold on....resulting in being hung up on.

I pay the additional $30 to have the old Dishwasher hauled away. Needless to say the old DW is currently sitting in the tenant's garage because the delivery service did NOT haul it away.I was missing components required for the DW install. None of the items missing like the the power cord or the coupler were suggested to me during the online order process just a Hose of some sort which I did order. The new dishwasher is delivered with no power cord (why wasn't that suggested?) and though the connection hose arrives with the dishwasher there is still a connection piece missing when my installer arrives to install the appliance.

I ordered it and didn't find out until 2 WEEKS later that they didn't have it in stock. I called to find out what was going on because I was never contacted to pick it up. I got connected to a young jerk at the customer service desk who had a serious attitude problem. He thought it was HILARIOUS that this was happening to me and cancelled my order without me requesting to cancel it. He also didn't notify me that he cancelled it so I kept checking the order status and that's when I was informed it had been cancelled. I then called the corporate office and spoke with a gentleman that was very nice and respectful but didn't DO ANYTHING to solve the problem, except repeatedly apologize. I (use to) spend a lot of cash at this place and will NEVER BE GOING BACK IF MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT! Companies like this shouldn't claim they have items in stock if they don't have them available to ship immediately after payment. I hope no one becomes a victim to this type of situation. It left me scrabbling around trying to find a hitch at another store for me to complete the task I needed the sleeve hitch for.

Lowe's Companies,Poor customer service,"On June 1 I ordered some covers from Lowe’s to be delivered. My paperwork including my bill of payment showed me that I would have a 1-3 day shipping. After a week of not hearing from Lowe’s I finally was able to get hold of customer service. At that time I was told it was 1-3 days shipping after they sent in the order. So it was clearly misleading at best but more of a lie. After talking to customer service to express my displeasure with the customer service I got to talk to a supervisor whom told me they were sorry. But I still did not have my things I had ordered. They did tell me it looked like my delivery should be June 12, 2 weeks after my order showing 1-3 days. After talking to the customer service supervisor about 20 minutes later I received an email saying my parts were on back order with no sign of when it would be available. And if I did not reply with in 3 days my order would be canceled. I hope if this happens they do at least refund my money. Because they took my money out immediately. This is very poor customer service. It tells me Lowe’s needs to do a lot of training in the customer service department.",0,1

I have spent over 6 hours in the past two days on hold or trying to get in contact with customer service. I could have chopped down the trees and crafted my own log cabin by the time these people are able to get one little thing done over the phone.

She then told me that her supervisor informed her that I had to wait until I sent the package back to get a refund. Again, I explained that I would not receive a package that is lost, so how could I send it back. She told me there was nothing more Lowe’s could do except offer me a 10% discount for my troubles.

Lowe's Companies,One Person that does a Great Job,"I had a horrible experience in Lowe’s in Waco Tx today. After waiting in line for about 10 minutes to return an item, I did not have my receipt so they gave me a cash card with about $35 credit on it.

So, we paid with another and went back to customer service. After 30 minutes in line I was fortunate enough to get a young lady named Mallory. She went out of her way to correct the issue and get me on my way.As I am in the store quite often, I had another issue with an on-line order.

Lowe's Companies,Online order nightmare,"Typically Lowes has been a ready and useful resource for me - gardening, small walk-in-and-pick up appliances and so when my refrigerator went out, I didn't hesitate to purchase a new one, online, from Lowes, paid in full. That's where the nightmare begins. In fact, at the time of this writing, I am on hold for the fourth hour of this day to try - again - to get an answer to this simple question: Where is my refrigerator? I received an email note that it'd be delivered today between 8 am and 8pm; however, when I called to confirm that, I was told that my refrigerator had not been loaded onto the truck as the ""order had been canceled."" I have contacted two different stores, physically traveled to one of them, waited in line, and finally spoken to a customer service rep who tried her best to be helpful. BUT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING. I have been told to contact the shipping company they outsource shipping to. I did. The shipping company told me to contact the store from which they were to have picked up the order. So I did. That store told me to contact the store through which the order was processed. But that store tells me they couldn't understand the note on my order saying ""appointment not taken,"" so suggested I contact either the store from which my refrigerator was to be shipped, or - again - the third party delivery service. I have now been on hold waiting for a customer service rep at Lowes' 1-800 number. It's been 20 minutes already and according to the recording, it could be another 45 before someone picks up. It is 10 after 3 in the afternoon now. All of this run-around started at 10:00 am. How in the world they cannot tell a paying customer where their order is and when to expect it - quickly & specifically - is unacceptable. I have experienced frustration via customer service in plenty of places before. We all have - but this is beyond the pale. The inefficiency of Lowes' customer service is staggering.",0,1

I received another email with another confirmation delivery for June 1st then again June 10th. Now I'm livid! I call again and reached a supervisor. I was told that Bosch is no longer doing special order items (because it is a black dishwasher) and it will change a regular order item but through Lowe's warehouse. A projected delivery date would be end of June or beginning of July. UHHH WHAT??? You know what I am so angry about!?!? The lack of communication!! Not once did they call or send an email about any of this!! I understand we are in a pandemic, but I am paying for a service and a dishwasher! Boost the economy they say, NOT through Lowe's though!! They offered a 10% off compensation. So on my $800 Dishwasher, that's $80. They didn't even offer to remove the haul away fee or offer to install for free. Not enough for MY TIME and energy wasted!! They need a better way of handling their customers. Awful company!!!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,I ordered lumber online for the Lowe's…,I ordered lumber online for the Lowe's on Cottle ave San Jose ca and was notified that my order was ready for pick. I thought they would have the lumber order ready in the lumber department. I was hoping that they would like some stores have the order ready in the pickup area of the lumber area. There was nobody in that area so I went into the lumber department and was told I had to go to customer service on the other side of the store. I notice that some of the employees had there mask pulled down. I went to customer service and they were not able to locate my order. After about 15 minutes and several calls the person helping me headed for the lumber area and said he would be back I followed him because at that point I figured that I would have to go land load the wood on a cart. Sure enough the employee grabbed a cart and started to load wood off the rack so I went over and helped him. I passed another employee not wearing a mask. On the way out there was now another worker on the outside who offered to help me load the wood on the my truck he was nice but again no mask no gloves. I really don't blame the guy who helped me he did not create the system. I saw several violations of the Covid 19 rules and their poor system exposes more people needlessly this is a huge management failure.,0,2

And I received ONE dog house...I called fed ex and they said they delivered one item that weighed 61lbs...well.tbe dog house for 1 weighs about 59 to 60 lbs...so it clearly delivered one...I called lowes online customer service and for the next two days I did not get a response. Waited for 1 hour each day...Then I went to my local lowes store and went to the internet pick up window...the lady left and a younger rookie attended and he said that he couldn't find the order...so he went to the older associates that were talking among themselves...the lady had to return and look with him for the order...she then told us that lowes had delivered two items....meaning two houses...then we told her can you find out where the other one is.? She said she could not that we would need to call lowes customer service through the phone...we said that would it be possible if they could call and the associate said ...its a 40 min wait are you sure you want to wait? And we said for the past few days Noone answered us we waited and waited so we figure due would wait at the store. We waited at the store and I began to think that there was something wrong because how come ...does lowes show two items delivered and we got one item...I called the manager for the manager ...when I did the associate hanged up on the customer service call and called the manager, maria..when she arrived I told her how scared I was that how is it that the system of lowes shows two delivered and we got one..and how come the associates could not give me a reason as to why that was...Maria just looked at me and she went to the associate as to confirm what I just said and she said we have to find out and call the customer service line..but its a 40 min wait...I said well can I get a refund and she said we have to call the customer service phone and we have to wait....the lady had to redial because she accidently hanged up...In the end..i found out that the 3rd vendor was trixie and WE called them...it turns out the vendor only shipped one....they still had the other one in their warehouse.... they said they would ship it soon...I don't understand why lowes said they delivered two houses when clearly it was one..

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Carpet Don't Use.... Go Local.,"Wow! I guess I really should have read the reviews before hiring lowes! Just like everyone else on the reviews I had a worst experience with Lowes Carpet. We just bought a new house wanted the carpets done in the bed room not because the carpet was trashed or anything they were actually in really good condition but because we just wanted a nicer pad. Went to 3 different places and it worked out that lowes had the best deal for us. With buying the new house we are pretty pinched for money. So went with Lowes, we walked in and knew exactly what we wanted after 1. going to three other places and 2. knowing we wanted the best pad available and middle of the road carpet. We sit with the man that was helping us out to order and tell him everything we want including their BEST PADDING. Sign the contract and go on. Carpet gets installed about a week later. We walk into the room so excited and it was like walking on a concrete floor. Immediately I went to the order form look everything over and under padding it said Stainmaster pad and a 5 digit code. I look up the code and sure enough it's the WRONG pad. Im furious! Call lowes explain what happened and it Is all my fault they tell me because I signed the contract for that pad. How am I supposed to know a 5 digit code of the padding I want? I am not an employee there. We go to the guy that ordered the carpet and he then tells us we never told him we wanted the best pad. So apparently now it's my fault and I am a liar. I explain to him I never would have ordered the middle of the road padding, I never would have even ordered a new carpet at all, what was in there was totally fine I legit just wanted to change the pad. They tell me in order to fix it I have to pay for the installation and the uncharge for the new pad. So now after paying for the carpet, the wrong pad and the installation. Now they want an addition $500 for us. Now new house so we can't afford to do that. Spent almost 2 weeks for someone to even talk to us, always being told someone would call back, never got called back. Honestly it was a horrible experience and the customer service that I received truly didn't even make me feel like a human. It was awful they didn't care about me all they only cared about was them making money. Ended up having to go to the store nearly in tears after being so fed up.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"No one home at Lowes, they don't answer the phone.","I purchased a washer and dryer as we were moving into a new home.

After numerous calls and finally getting through to someone in delivery I was told they would be delivered at a later date on June 4.

My husband then drove to Lowes in Bluffton SC in complete frustration trying to speak to a human. Long story short they have no idea where or when we will get delivery of the washer and dryer. This is not the first time we have had a problem like this but rest assured it will be the last.

Lowe's Companies,Inaccurate Product / In-stock Information Online,"Lowes customer service reps and store managers are very kind and try to be helpful, which is why I added the second star. But there is no accurate communication. The website does not provide accurate product information, neither the phone customer service rep or the store managers have the same product information. A large portion of the products online cannot be purchased over the phone via customer service, they need to transfer you to a store manager at a physical location.Phone wait times are between 45+ minutes and the time to resolve issues has taken me over 3.5 hours on the phone for one issue. In-stock information is not correct on the website along with inaccurate tracking information once your item has been shipped. Only way to check the status or get a mail service tracking number is by calling and waiting another hour or so on hold on the phone. I've had orders cancelled with no explanation and due to inaccurate stock counts and unknown product shipment expectations which are not listed when making an online purchase.

Did not even offer to have one transferred in I mean they have seen me more than once in there asking for it. And why would you have on display an item that you have been out of for over a month but have it in other stores. Good example of bad inventory management. Either way as always customer service at your location is really terrible and your employees do show how unhappy they are working there. Either way no mater how close you are to me I really hate going there never a good experience and obvious this is what corporate shows.

Firstly, I guess 3 in the afternoon was a perfect time to block off the mulch isle and rearrange some things for 45 minutes while a line of customer formed. Which I get it things happen. But 45 minutes? No update throughout but I still waited since I wanted to lay mulch on this beautiful day. Once they opened the isle they said it’s ready. I and 2 other customers go to brown mulch and wait another 5-7 minutes since it wasn’t cut open. I finically decided I was gunna go ask an employee to open it for us. He was a supervisor I’m guessing( dressed differently than other employees) so I asked if someone could cut open the brown mulch pallet and he gets loud immediately and says “WE ARE WORKING ON IT SIR“.. Ok I thought that was weird but whatever. So before I was about to walk back I thought maybe he misunderstood me or something and I asked him wait, who is working on it? This is the first time anyone has asked about opening it. Remember they said the isle is ready to shop now. I was polite as can be. He then proceeds to get even louder like he’s talking to a child. “I SAID WE ARE WORKING ON IT SIR”.. i lost my sh**. I said first of all I don’t need all the attitude after waiting 45 min and only asking to open the mulch and getting talked to like this. He rolled his eyes and I said ok whatever I’m going to Home Depot. He then says in front of all the customers..”please do” like I was being an inconvenience for wanting to spend money there. I called him a dic* and left. I will not be back. I am not that “guy” to cause a scene but he was completely in the wrong from the first words out of his mouth. Ridiculous.",0,1

Asked for a supervisor, now I Am on the phone for 1 and half hours. Supervisor tried calling and they hung up on her. Told that I could go there and speak to the manager. The reason I did this online is so I could just go to the customer pickup and not have to wait outside on line to get into the store. Wouldn’t common sense tell you if you can’t fulfill your orders in a timely order you would stop taking more until you catch up. Cancelled my order.

Lowe's Companies,They didn't care about me or my time,"5/29/2020Good afternoonMy name is Mark and I am writing to advise you of my experience with Lowes in your Mt. Holly, NJ store. First, let me let you know that I purchased $4,000+ in appliances in the last 2 weeks because I am re-doing my kitchen. I ordered my refrigerator (Family Hub 24.2 cu ft. Model # RF265BEAESR. Item# 689595) online. I took off yesterday and waited all day and the refrigerator was never delivered. I called all day yesterday and this morning to no avail. I went to the Mt. Laurel store only to find out from a very nice customer service representative that my order was canceled. No one from Lowes bothered to call, text or email me to advise me of any cancelations or the delivery not coming. The rep in Appliances at the Mt. Laurel store advised me that the Mt. Holly store had 2 refrigerators, probably one in stock and the floor model. We drove another 8 to 10 miles to Mt. Holly and when we got there Cordell advised us that there weren't anymore in stock. He was awesome and tried his best to help us out. He called other stores to see if he could order the refrigerator for us. He also reached out to another department and was told that there is a new model and the cost would be $300 more. I asked if I could get a price match due to me losing a day of work waiting on my refrigerator that never showed up and he said he couldn't and he called for a manager. Juan Citron (sp?) stopped by on his way somewhere else in the store. I explained my situation to him and he looked at the screen for 4 seconds and said ""no we can't."" I asked him to listen and he again said ""it's nothing I can do."" I found out that he wasn't the store manager, but rather a department manager and Appliances wasn't even his department. I then asked for his manager and he seemed shocked and blurted out Ebony. He and Cordell both said her phone number was going to be on the bottom of the receipt (it wasn't). The phone numbers were the 800 number and the store number. Knowing when you call, you will never get through to the Manager. I asked for the manager's last name and found her on LinkedIn. I plan to call corporate, do a Google review and place a review on Lowes website to express my discontent. I used to work for Lowes and I understand how it work. I would really appreciate if someone could let me know if there is anything you can do to help rectify this horrible process and treatment of customers who just spent almost $5,000 at your establishment.

Called the next morning and waited on hold for almost an hour. CS person was nice but after she made some calls found out that the tub hadn’t even shipped from the vendor yet and no one had any idea when it would ship. Unacceptable to tell a customer that an item is on a truck for delivery when Lowe’s hadn’t even received it yet. Wasted a week out of my construction project. Cancelled the order.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe’s in Millsboro,"Lowe’s in Millsboro, Delaware has got to be the worst store ever. When you call there you NEVER, NEVER get anybody.

Lowe's Companies,Cancelled order....not a happy customer,"I ordered a refrigerator with a delivery date of May 9. With COVID19 I know the mfg had slowed and my delivery date was changed to May 27. I was fine with that. The 27th came and went with no delivery and no updated notification to say it would not be delivered. My husband stayed home all day as the delivery was to be between 8am and 8pm. Got hold of appliances. After checking, the salesman said the store had not even received the refrigerator for it to be delivered. I tried to call the store the next day to find out why I didn't receive any communication. Terrible experience. I was cutoff once while waiting for Customer Service and then could not get through to any department for over 1/2 hour. It kept directing me back to the original menu selection. I have never been a big Lowes fan but this sealed it. I finally found a way to cancel my order. Not a happy camper but live and learn.

Lowe's Companies,"Philadelphia, MS Lowe's Does NOT Honor warranty if you live in Carthage","I purchased a Whirlpool dishwasher from Lowe's in Philadelphia, MS in December of 2018. I also purchased and extended 5 year warranty. The top rack of the dishwasher broke. I filed a claim Thursday, April 23, 2020 with the warranty department. A service technician was scheduled to come out for repair between the hours of 8-4 Tuesday, April 28, 2020. Around 3:00 that day no one came. I called Lowe's in Philadelphia only for them to tell me that no one was coming because they had no technician to service my area yet the technician only lived about 25 miles from my area. I was upset because no one had the courtesy to call me to let me know. I was told they had 3 days to find a technician or they would have to replace the dishwasher. I got a call 2 days later telling me they were going to replace the dishwasher because there was not a whirlpool certified technician in my area.. I was told once everything was processed, they'd call me with an installation date. A week went by and no one called. I called warranty and they couldn't give me any information. I called the store and was told I was getting a new dish washer. Another week went by and still no results. I spoke with Mr. Ward, who is a manager and he also told me I would be getting a new dishwasher. I have spoken to Penny and Mr. Wayne and several other people at Lowe's and at the warranty department over the last month and still no results. I got a call from a Lowe's rep on Memorial Day Monday and she told me that she had my dishwasher in stock. There was a pause and I finally said I don't really know what to say because I have spoken to so many people and the issue still wasn't resolved. She insinuated that I had a check that was sent from warranty that was supposed to be paid to Lowe's. I told her I hadn't received one. I told her that because I'd had so much trouble, I was told I was gong to have a new dishwasher installed prior to receiving a warranty check. I explained how upset I was. I explained that at this point I'd rather take the money and have someone repair the dishwasher myself.I said I didn't want anything else from Lowe's. I asked the rep if I got someone to order the parts and repair it, would the dishwasher still be covered under warranty. She didn't give me a definite or clear answer and somehow we got disconnected. I truly believe she hung up on me because she never called me back. That was two days ago.When I purchased the dishwasher and extended warranty I had to give them my address. Therefore they were aware of where I lived and should have known if they had someone to service my area if need be. I should not have been sold a warranty if there was no one to service it through the warranty department. I filed the claim April 23, 2020 and today is May 27, 2020. My dishwasher still needs repair. I spoke with a manager, Mr. Wayne Saturday because another manager Mr. Ward told me earlier in the week that someone was bringing the dishwasher that Saturday. Mr. Wayne was supposed to call me back Monday. Today is Wednesday and I haven't heard from him. This same thing happened to a relative of mine where they had no one to service the appliance and what was so crazy is that an outside technician walked her through what she needed to do to fix the appliance and she repaired it herself. I would like the money I paid for the dishwasher and extended warranty and an additional $100 for all the hassle.Cassandra Dawson",0,1

Among several other recent problems, I ordered online for store pick-up 12 days ago, and they still can't tell me when we can expect that product-- If I can find someone to talk to about it, without them hanging up on me. I think it would have been better to close and wait until they were ready to operate a business than what they are doing. If they can't handle this, they are really going to be screwed when the Martians invade...

It's for a Master Cool water pump that only lasted a total of 4 months. Although it was purchased in September, the unit doesn't get used through the winter months. What that means is that from November through March, it wasn't in use. I'm very upset that they have decided not to honor the warranty. It was the 3rd pump we had to replace, and none of them lasted longer than a few months. It wasn't bound up from water calcification, but rather, the units seem to have some kind of electrical issues. Very very upset that they aren't taking this seriously.",0,3

Lowe's Companies,Better stay clear of Lowes,"Better stay clear of Lowes. I personally have purchased a lot of stuff from Lowes and refused to go anywhere else. However, on May 11,2020, I went to purchase a new washer and dryer, as my old one had quit. First they wanted to charge me $30.00 a piece to remove the old washer and dryer, but fortunately, there was a tree cutting man at my house that removed them for free. Then after paying cash for the washer as they had it in stock (or so they said) , but would have to order the dryer (3 to 5 days). So I said okay I'll pay for the washer, but do not bring it until you bring the dryer. Lowes said oh we cannot deliver it until May 25, 2020. Really 2/1/2 weeks before I could even get it. So, I waited and and May 25, 2020, Lowes Delivery driver calls me and says he has the dryer, but I wouldn't be getting the washer, as Lowes had none. I spent a better of 4 hours trying to talk to some one on the phone, and after about 15 calls they finally decided that I was giving up. Again after about 4 hours, a person from the construction department comes on and tells me, I didnt know what I was talking about as they had 18 washers in the building. You see I know what happened they got those washers in- in the 4 1/2 hours it took me to get to talk to someone. But that's not all, when the washer was taken out of the box it had major dents in it, and I was afraid to take back to the store as I couldnt do without a washer another 2 to 4 weeks. So I kept the washer thinking okay they should at least sell this to me at 1/2 price, did they? Oh no, only a $78.00 dollar refund. NEVER WILL I USE LOWES, I WILL START GOING TO HOME DEPOT. I have pictures, if any one is interested!!!",0,1

After constant follows and visiting Lowes i got the installation guys on 13 or 16th Feb, they took the measurements and left. I went to lowes to get the order for installation to my surprise the guy who took the measurement did not label the rooms appropriately and it was not possible to figure out bedroom1,2,3 belongs to which room. So, they said we are going to get the installation company again to fix it.The guys came for the measurement again on march 21st after a long battle I had to fight with Managers (one was Kevin the rudest) and other persons. Anyways the guy came for the re-measurement and took the measurement again. When i went again to order installation guess what no body in Lowes can figure out what that idiot did this time again and he repeated the same mistake.Because of Covid I did not follow up or wanted any one to visit my home but i was astounded that no one from Lowes ever contacted me in the past 2 months as well.On May 21st I went again and this time I got 2 ladies Sam and one more, this time they promised me the same BS that i have been getting for past 4 months, alot of promises and attitude but no real work. I visited again on May 23rd myself as i did not get any call and met Keisha who absolutely has never done any front line jobs and don't know how to talk to customers. She was pretty rude and I replied in the similar and left to see the Manager. The same Manager Mr. Kevin was on duty at that time, as the measurement guy made the same mistake again, I told him to please order only 4 windows which are NOT part of any bed room as those were the only 4 windows i was sure about. He ordered with same amount that was promised for 9 windows and now i am paying same amount for 4 windows. As Ii was not left with alot of options as i already bought the blinds some time back from Lowes so i had to stick withthem. Today I took my blinds to get them cut accordingly and guess what the final nail in the coffin the lady at the store (Heather) i can not believe she copied the wrong measurements and cut my blinds with the measurement for height as width. 45 1/2 was the height and she cut my blind width as 45 1/2 where else the actual width is 47 1/4, i mean what else can go wrong and how extreme un-professional bunch of those clowns can be who are working in lowes.The issue is still not sorted and if there is any customer service Lowes has my order should be handled with utmost priority and i also demand for the compensation of hours i have waisted, fuel that i have burnt and the frustration caused.",0,1

While all employees are wearing masks, the vast majority are doing so with the mask pulled down below their nose, or the entire mask completely down around their neck. Tell me, how is that meeting the recommended guidelines - and where is the management? I observed many employees pulling down their mask to talk to customers (which is the exact OPPOSITE of what should be done). What gives, Lowes? You and Walmart are pretty much the only game in these small towns, and you're taking full advantage of that fact by ignoring and/or disregarding the safety of your customers - knowing full well that many customers have no other options.

This afternoon I tried calling again and I sat on hold with customer service for 1 hour and 7 minutes before someone answered, and the agent said she couldn't hear me. So what did she do? She kept repeating for me to call the customer service number again, and then hung up.I will literally never order from Lowe's ever again. This goes beyond COVID-19 throwing us all for a loop. This is just plain incompetence and terrible customer service.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,LOWES SUCKS!!!!!,"On May 15th Me and my girlfriend ordered an accent table and three planters for our new house. The accent table was an exclusive online order but the planters were in stock at the store in Brantford. On may 21st, and no update regarding the order, we decided to head to the store to pickup the planters as they were in stock. We waited outside in a line to get into the store to speak with customer service to let them know we wanted to cancel the 3 planters from our online order as we were just going to pick them up in the store. The customer service agent took the online order number and advised she would cancel those 3 planters from the order and we would not be charged and the accent table order would continue. She directed us to the garden center to pick them up. We then waited outside for an hour and the planters were not even located in the Garden Center, they were inside the store we just left. We were eventually able to purchased the three planters and a plant, paying over $150.00. The following day, an email went out advising us the online order of our accent table was filled excluding the planters. However, our credit card was charged for the full order amount with the 3 planters included. Almost $300.00!! On May 23rd, my girlfriend called Lowes customer service and spent 1.5 hours on the phone regarding the issue of our credit card wrongfully being charged. The call somehow disconnected and nothing was done. On may 24th I called the customer service line at 8:34 I was placed on hold. The customer service center doesn't open until 8:30. They didn't answer my call until 9:10!!! Once they answered me, they told me they had to forward my call to a customer service representative and I would be placed in the que again. I waited on hold for another 30 minutes just to try and get our money back for over charging us. The process is still ongoing.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Return policy,"I have been a local customer of Lowes for longer than I can remember. After all these years, I tried to return an item today and was refused. They stated that the product was past its 90 day return window. I must say I was totally shocked, I have never been refused before. This was an unopened faucet that they are currently selling and they would not take it back and stated it was out of their hands as the computer would not even let them give a store credit. Yes it has been 5 months that I have been setting on this return, but that has not been the number one thing on my mind since January. Being a person over 65, and the government keeping everyone on edge, I didn’t think it would be an issue to make the return when things got back to normal. Well... I’m stuck with a faucet. My advice is with Lowes you had better stick by their letter of the law, or as they suggested, sell it on Marketplace and get something back...wow. I would suggest that you purchase from Home Depot as I had the same situation with them and they did the return no problem.",0,5

When they didn’t show up I called the store. After investigating they found that they didn’t have a full pallet to deliver. They didn’t bother to call me and explain what happened or tell me how they were going to fix the problem. When I told the night manager that I expected my delivery the next day he just laughed and said that they already had 40 deliveries scheduled and that was not going to happen. He then promised that he would have Linsey the day manager call me the next morning. At 10:00 Saturday morning I called the store and asked for Linsey. They told me that she wasn’t working that day. I have ran my own service business for 50 years. If I treated my customers like this I would not have lasted a year. This is not the first time this store has sold me merchandise and not had the product. There was plenty of product when I paid for it.

Lowe's Companies,Worst online shopping experience ever,"Buying a shelving unit on 5/15/20 for delivery, took nearly an hour to get their checkout system to work, trying two computers and three browsers. Tried to call customer service for help twice, and gave up both times after holding for 30+ minutes. Finally managed to place the order using my phone. Zero order updates for seven days, website still says ""In Process."" Called customer service on 5/22/20 for an order update, on hold 52 minutes before speaking with someone who checked with the vendor, then told me they were backlogged and to call back next week for an update. I can't wait to spend another rage-inducing hour on hold listening to the same static-ridden eight bar loop of light jazz while a too-cheerful recorded voice blasts ""all representatives are helping other customers. We'll be with you momentarily"" into my ear every 30 seconds. Waited after the call to take the survey, the recorded message says they're no longer taking feedback and hung up on me. I fired off an email of complaint to their customer care at lowes.com address, and received the auto-reply ""Please note this is an automated response and this mailbox is not currently being monitored"" which directed me to their website for order updates.Now checking my bank account online, I see they've reversed the original charge. What the heck does that mean? They charged my account but didn't ship the order, now they refunded the order payment back to my account?Worse. Service. Ever.",0,1

My God it is a home supply store-you’re going to tell me they couldn’t cut it with a saw. They do cut wood for you! Explain to me what’s the difference!

Lowe's Companies,!!!Please read this review if you intent to shop at lowes!!!,"Ordered 19 boxes of vinyl plank flooring online. 6 Boxes show up a week later, but they were all damaged. The FedEx driver laid them halfway on and halfway off of my porch. I had to take these 6 boxes back to the store to exchange them. The cashier at customer services refunded me the money, therefore I had to purchase the 6. Another week passes and I receive a knock at the door, It's the FedEx driver. He asked me to look in his truck at the damaged flooring. He said he wouldn't except them this way,and to refuse the order, and he's right, they were unusable. I suggested we unload them, and then I could return them to the store like I did the other 6. He stopped me and said the fastest way would be to refuse the order and I would be refunded promptly. Well, another 2 weeks has past and I haven't seen any more flooring, or any money. I've been to my local store to buy more since, but they are unable to refund online orders. I've tried to call the number for online orders several times throughout theses few weeks, but after holding for over an hour without anyone picking up the phone, I would get frustrated and hang up. Finally after I see a refund of what would be 2 boxes on my bank account, I get motivated to speak to someone and stay on hold for 1 hour and 30 minutes. I FINALLY SPOKE WITH A REAL PERSON. The customer service rep on the phone told me they had delivered a different number than what had actually been delivered. I had to wait another 30 minutes for her to contact FedEx. The outcome was that I would be refunded for the boxes of flooring as lowes received them back from FedEx. And when I asked what they were going to do in order to not lose a customer, her manager told her to give me a 5% discount coupon. Iv'e spent over $5000 at this store in the last two months, without using my military discount(still pending online), I don't need 5% off. I need good customer service in which they do not have. Lowes has lost a valuable customer!! I'm team Home Depot for now on! I will never go back and I encourage anyone who needs help or good customer service to not shop at this business.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Don't shop here.,I used to come to lowes for the better service and products. Muskegon Michigan lowes killed that ideal. I bought 10 feet of carpet. They tried to charge me $2400.00.

When I went to Home Depot to make my purchases, immediately after I left the store, I encountered a man who told me he works at that same Lowes location but does not shop there for the same reason I never will again. He told me that there were only six people working each shift with more staff cutbacks coming. Management determined that, in order to increase profits, staff cutbacks were necessary. Apparently no thought has been given to the number of sales they lose because of people that leave empty handed like I did. While my intended purchases amounted to less than $100 this trip, they won't have a chance at selling me any big ticket items because I will not even consider going there again.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Poor Business Practices,"Lowes, has become the worst hardware store in America slowly,but surely plus a lot of the items they carry now are sub-prime quality, vs. Lowes competition. Over the years Lowes, has been being Demolished/Beaten in every way buy it's competition. For example if you purchase a power tool say like a leaf blower for the home for example, Lowes will only take responsibility for that power leaf blower for 30 days ONLY. The Home Depot has never turned me down, ""EVER"" on anything I've ever had to return. That also goes for Westlake hardware, True Value, etc matter of fact that goes for just about anywhere else I can think of. Now if it's has been damaged, or has been mistreated or, anything else of that nature I completely understand. So if you purchase a power tool gas, or electric, and for some reason don't immediately use it, Lord forbid you don't even open the box for awhile and it's sit for a couple of months, then when the time comes to use it, and it doesn't work, your on your own with it, then Lowes forces your to deal with the manufacturer, not only is that a huge hassle but can be quite costly with the shipping involved,not to mention the down time. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything at Lowes for a very long time unless i'm desperate for something. : To Lowes, you are practicing bad business habits, and it's showing. Some product knowledge for your employees in their particular departments, wouldn't hurt.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Don't order online and expect pickup,"Purchased a grill online with accessories. Next day recieved notification it was ready. Arrived at Union City, CA location for pick up in the parking lot. Called the number 5 times located in parking stall to let them know I was outside for pick up. It kept going back to the automated operator with no response. Had to go inside to wait in customer service line to get everything. That was the whole reason I shopped online was for the pick up service. Explained that to them and they just shrugged their shoulders. To my surprise the grill was assembled. They asked of I had a cart. I stated, ""no that is reason why I bought online is for them to bring it out"". They seemed irritated they had to assist with this. Again, the reason why I shopped online to begin with, so I didn't have to go in. So I just grabbed the grill and wheeled it out myself since it had wheels. Of course it's too wide to fit in my SUV so have to go in to get a screwdriver to take a piece off so it would fit. Then took 15 min for them to locate a screwdriver for me. I proceeded to remove a piece and noticed the edge of grill was dented with some rust stains. They were selling me a damaged floor model obviously. So wheeled it back in to just get a boxed model. Waited in line once again for them to return the original one a resale me the boxed one. If I would have known this I would have shopped physically in the store. They shouldn't offer online purchase for pick up if you're going to have to come in to get everything in the first place.

Lowe's Companies,I used to like Lowe's,"I used to like Lowe's . it was sometimes higher than it's competitors but the stores were well kept and the staff helpful. It delivered its products and assembled them Things worked. However, the MBAs have taken over now. They send delivery people who half the time dont know how to do the set ups and are rude. You can order something through Lowes and never learn it arrived or find it is the wrong product or broken. It takes forever. The usual MBA types are ruining the company. Complaints do no good. I no longer shop there exclusively and am having better luck elsewhere. Lowe's just doesnt care anymore . Their employees are really unhappy with the corporate nonsense and destruction of what was a good company",0,2

Lowe's Companies,Unsafe for customers at high risk for COVID 19,"I just picked up a small item from curbside pickup. I have stage 4 leukemia and am very careful about following recommendations to avoid contracting COVID-19. So far, on my rare trips out of the house, every company has offered no-contact pickup. Assuming that Lowe's would also have a policy to protect it's employees and customers, I arranged for curbside pickup. Although the young lady and I were both wearing masks, she came right up to my car window to give me the item and have me sign for it. This allowed approximately 2 feet between our faces. This, for high-risk customers, is unsafe and in no way complies with ""social distancing recommendations. I'll shop Amazon next time. You can do better, Lowe's!",0,1

I then received a call from the delivery center on May 15th saying they would not be able to deliver on the 16th as someone had a family emergency. They then told me that I would receive the washer and dryer on Sunday, May 17th from the hours of 12noon and 3pm. Well here we are and no washer & dryer! Also, I called their delivery center once again and was kept on hold for 20 minutes and they said they now have to locate the washer & dryer to see if it is even on the truck???? Wow!!!! Disorganized! They have had my money for over 3 weeks and I have no product!! I recently purchased a Refrigerator and dishwasher from home Home Depot and it was delivered in 4 days!!! I recommend to buy appliances at Home Depot!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Police Informed/Called Out 5-17-2020,"Was at Lowe’s in Sevierville getting a battery and the guy that worked that department helped me and said if I could find the same model number somewhere else and they would price match it. In addition I walked up to the register and told the lady and let her know who he was. She got a assistant store manager (Name I Won’t Share) I asked if there was a store manger. She begins to get in my face and scream saying she is the store manager. Well your name tag doesn’t say that. She snatched the battery from me to check stuff. She begins to argue with me and talk about me to employees and also customers laughing, rolling her eyes and being rude. She then calls a man assistant manger that came up and he begins to become threaten in a body way. He begins to take off his mask and starts yelling at me saying that’s not the right battery and everything. I said yes it is it’s u1r-230 the same battery I had just a different price. He continued to raise his tone. He pretty much said I need to respect his employees and what the female manager did was okay. He said that it is what it is. I was so appalled that she got in my face especially letting her know 100000 times during the whole thing that I had sezuires and that I couldn’t be upset with this nonesense. She was so rude and the gentleman too. The last time I went in there a few months back I was called a f*g for buying flowers for my mom. I’m disgusted with this store. Save your self the trip and SHOP HOME DEPOT! Don’t go here clearly they think it’s okay to verbal assault someone. I wonder what they do to elderly people and the special needs",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Never again will I shop at Lowes,"This was the second time we purchase a refrigerator at Lowe’s and this will be the last time. I can see why people like Home Depot Service is better. You have to go find someone to help you and then he couldn’t take out the old phone number and enter the new phone number and save it, and after my husband ask him twice when could they deliver it, he never answered the question, I had to call to ask them if they had a delivery date on my order and asked her if they had the new phone number on the order and she said no and she had a bad attitude which cause me to get a attitude with her. Then I gave her my new phone number. I called back today to make sure they had the new phone number was entered and the lady answered the phone today said she doesn’t do that and I would have to call the delivery department after 12:30pm and so I did and again no one answered the phone. Today is the day of the delivery and if they don’t call or deliver it today then we will be getting our money back in the morning and we will be going over to Home Depot to get one like we should have went in the first place. When I scored their ratings as a 1 star it was really a zero if they had it on there. They had bad service and customer service and nobody wants to help you and you can’t get anybody to answer the phone. This store was on Fairfield Drive in Pensacola Florida. I guess our $1200.00 dollars isn’t good enough,",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Something needs to change,"Something needs to change, originally I thought is was just a delivery date. Now it's who I chose to do business with.I had ordered materials to build a sunroof for a day care center. When I ordered it, I specifically asked for the delivery to be coordinated with the staff at the Day Care and provided a phone number to facilitate that. I had also hoped to get a delivery on a Saturday if possible, as the work must be done when the day care is closed. I realized that may not be possible, the date that was given however, was a Monday, leaving an entire week where kids and teachers would have to work around that pile of lumber.I figured someone failed to read the delivery instructions, and it would be resolved once it got into the local stores system. Nope, they never coordinated, and when I tried to rearrange the Monday delivery date on Friday (5/15) nobody answered the phone at the local store, nor at thecorporate office number. In fact, I waited on that corporate line for what seemed a 1/2 hour at least.Now I'm 'real upset' (Trustpilot didn't like what I was). I went to the store(#2309) and cancelled the order. I will not deal with a company that won't work with, or even talk to their customers.I can tell by the reviews here that my case wasn't unique, or just a simple oversight.

In particular, a short while ago I was interested in a ceiling fan for my screened-in porch. It was $99.00 and installation was $99.00. Yesterday, I went to Lowe's to purchase the fan and discovered it was now $119.00 and installation would be $139.00!!!! I felt immediately that Lowe's was taking advantage of their customers during the Covid pandemic when they should be helping at least a little.

Lowe's Companies,Made an online order a couple of days…,"Made an online order a couple of days ago. The order was delivered in due time, but delivered to the wrong address. I am not holding Lowes responsible for that, but once I got the order two items were missing from the box. It was obvious that the box had not been tampered with. It seems to me that the items were never put in the box when packed. I understand mistakes are made, and I am not upset that my items were missing, but my problem is with the customer help line. When making my first call, I was on hold for nearly 25 minutes before I finally ended the call. When making my second call, I was put on hold again. However, this time I ended the call after nearly 15 minutes. My only option at this point is to keep calling, and hopefully I can talk to a real human!! One would think, if they are that busy, they would have a call back system. But, this is Lowes.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I love to get my things at Lowes but…,"I love to get my things at Lowes but are horrible at customer service . Lowes employees walk right past you and you try to get their attention but they totally ignore you. O understand they are busy but they can at least acknowledge and get someone else to assist. Last week I waited for about 35 minutes in an isle to get some assistance. A lead asked me to wait in an isle and said someone is one his way to help . But that didn't happen. After 45 minutes, my husband went to use the rest room and asked an employee for assistance. Finally an employee by the name of ""Arwyn"" helped us to get what we wanted.

When we already gotten rid of the old dishwasher. 3 days later lowes had to go pick it up & bring it to us. My husband had to install.May 3rd order a chainsaw for curbside pickup. As I'm very high risk for Covid-19. Website said 3 to 7 days. No information on 8th day. Kept checking my email & order status. Tried calling customer service. What a joke that was. I was on hold for 2 hours 1 if those days. Called store they told me the 14th. Still no email. Checked order status again. Said 1X stick processing like every day. Finally on the 16th. I called store again. They had 2 in stock. Spoke with Steve the manager. Who informed me that I would have to come into customers service & cancel my online order & buy the 1 he had put at customer service desk for me.The people were wearing their masks below their noses.

Lowe's Companies,If I could put a zero on Lowe's that's…,"If I could put a zero on Lowe's that's exactly what they deserve. I've been back and forth with Lowes for the last time they did an install of a Generator that their salesman fail to be honest about the Generator noise level even after I asked him. When the installation was done on April 3rd 2020, and I immediately came home since they said it will take all day maybe 5 or 6 hours I came home to a Loud Lawnmower Sound very irritating and annoying noise then instead of them waiting on GA Power like they said they would they left my house with this annoying noise coming from the side of my house. My neighbor came to me immediately asking what was the product said is loud and annoying and sits at her window I told her is a Generator she said is it going to be on all day I said no only when lights goes off I called the Contractor to ask why is the Generator on and did they leave his response was yes we had to leave because GA Power is taking too long so I thought it was unprofessional for them to leave the house without waiting on Ga Power to return. After Ga Power came and put back on my power I ask him if he knew why the Generator was so loud he said you get what you pay for. I was so angry and upset that I call the same SALESPERSON and ask why he lied about the noise level was lower than my a/c unit he remained quiet then after I told him what Ga Power told me he's then going off said he's a Electrician and knows nothing about a Generator what does he expect. I filled a complaint to ask Lowes if they can move the Generator to the back of the house or take it out and refund me because I don't want to have problems with my neighbor and is close to her window and Lowe's salesman lied about the product just to profit them and I'm unhappy with this Generator they told me they will go half with me to move it to the back of the house I must pay them $1,500. So I said nope you'll can come get it. My problem that I encountered now after they came and took out the Generator but left their transfer switch box and I told them the same day about my kitchen outlets was not working then Customer Service told me that they have other assignments to do and she'll let me know when her guys can come to check my outlets will be on 4-24-20. Her technician guy told me I had a bad outlet and is nothing they did. I explained to him that I never had electrical problems before the install so I know is something they did he insisted that is my outlets so I hired a Electrician and fix it, 2 days later all my lower level lights and outlets was off I contacted Lowe's but they denied that it was cause by them so I called another Electrician and he checked all my outlets and said it has strength but there's a shortage coming from somewhere in the breaker box and he ask if a Generator was installed lately I said yes so he said the only way to know if there's a nail in it is by cutting my wall and sure enough it was the damage that was coming from the transfer switch to my breaker box they nailed it directly into the wires. All Lowes want to argue about is that my County came out and checked everything and the Generator was working perfectly. I never disagreed that it wasn't working I'm arguing about the damage caused by the nail they drill through the transfer switch to my breaker wires and damage my lights then I had spoiled food in my deep freezer thrown away and asking Lowes to compensate me pay me for out of pocket expenses but they won't own up and do what's right. So I'm letting customers know be careful who you do business with because they only want your money. I am out of pocket expenses for $587.00 they refuse to give me back keep closing my complaint said there's nothing else they can do. I'm not giving up for the truth and still waiting to speak to a manager. And I still have to hire a painter to do my garage for $750 which I don't have.

Lowe's Companies,I live in an area that has 3 Lowes…,"I live in an area that has 3 Lowes stores within a 20 mile circle. I am closer to store #0599 in Chester,Va. So naturally I order building materials from there. (about 9 miles away.) Of the orders i have sent that store for delivery, ($59.00) Each order to that store has been pushed out to stores much farther away. Even though the store # 0599 (Chester) showed availability of all the items at the time of my order. And all three have been wrong, either missing items or the wrong items shipped. Then the fun begins. Trying to contact someone who could possibly help is next to impossible. At all of the stores the phone to customer service rings and rings. If and when they answer the phone they put you on hold until the call disconnects. Then you have to start all over again. On one call i was told the manager would get back to me very shortly. Nope no return call. One of the missing items on the last order was missing. This was noted to the delivery dept. on Wednesday when the order was delivered missing at total of those 5 items along with 6 other items. i was told that the 5 pieces of aluminum drip edge was out of stock. Was told today Friday that they are still out of stock.Two other stores that are on the way to my location show they had quite a few IN stock. But did store # 0676 try to get these 5 items. Nope. I know these are tough times but when you make an order and the delivery date is ""8"" days out. There is time to get it right. Home Depot here i come for my future orders. UPDATE: upon breaking open the delivery this evening, I find that the order is still not complete PLUS they shorted me my 2 x 4 x 8 x 12ft again by two boards. Bent, bowed and crooked. ALSO, put only 13 of the 20 tie straps loose on the package. When they delivered the first time on Wednesday, i counted them in the box and there was 20.

I went to the store the next day and the lumber department said they knew nothing of my order. On my way to call customer service I received an email thanking me for my order. Apparently they had just put in the order when I asked about it. Customer Service said they would take care of it since I had been waiting for tem days. I went back to lumber to wait for my order. An hour later the same person who had told me they didn't know about my order walked past me and said tgast my order was on a cart in back and if I wanted it I should go gat it myself.

We went there 3 times last month to shop, and saw hundreds of people in the store without social distancing. Most customers do not wear a mask, and employees don't either.

Apparently there was an email sent to me that was in my junk folder stating that I had three days to notify customer service that I was okay with a delay in my shipping order.when I called to reinstate the order and the sale pricing which I purchased it at they said federal mandates state that I that they do not have the ability nor obligation to maintain the discounted price of my original purchase. Then they stated that they weren't able to reorder my product until they had some available in stock. When I initially placed the order there were none available and I was expecting a delay and yet I'm liable for an email that was sent to my junk folder and the only outreach from Lowe's to let me know that my order would be canceled.they're representative wouldn't even note the account of my experience to assure that I'd have some sort of opportunity to get a discount when I replaced my order.

A few mins pass and my Dad looks for her and she is just chilling putting up paint and then she says ""Oh, I couldn't find him"" and just looked away. Then proceeds to tell my Dad you can look for him if you want. Just beyond rude.

Lowe's Companies,Home Depot and Lowes Comparison,"I shop at both Lowe's and Home Depot. I trust both stores to carry many items that I want at good prices. I like them both for different reasons at different times.They are both very similar but there are differences. I always look up items online before going to either store. One will sell something that I want for much less than the other. It doesn't matter if it is a low dollar item or a high value item. They will carry very similar products but the prices for those products will vary a lot between the two stores. Then, they vary slightly with what they offer. One might have something in the quantity that I want while the other will not. One might have a color or design that I prefer. Lowe's had landscape fabric pins for less than at Home Depot. Home Depot had vinyl sheeting flooring for less than Lowe's. With the flooring comparison, Lowe's does not carry TrafficMaster. I checked reviews online and TrafficMaster is quite similar to Congoleum which Lowe's does carry. I did have a problem with my local Home Depot store when I purchased my range. They had the best price but it was a floor model. Since it was a floor model, they were going to charge me for delivery and for installation. I found out that I could order it online, not a floor model, for the same price and have it delivered and setup for free. I didn't try to buy a floor model appliance at Lowe's. They had the best price for the type of refrigerator that I wanted and they delivered for free.I really like both stores but I think that you need to check online before shopping at either store.",0,5

After a long wait time finally got ahold of a manager who said he knew nothing about my order and would have to call me back. Then when he did call back he said it was never sent out for delivery and he did not know why. He said he would have to send an email to another manager to see if he knew what happended. I told him I cannot take another day off work for this and he said he was sorry but he has no control over this. So now they have my money, I lost a day of work, a upset wife who has no stove, and absolutly no resolve for the problem and a manager that said all he can do is send an email to another manager.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Horrible customer service,"Incident on April 26thI ordered several items in March for a kitchen remodel. I was never called that my backsplash was in. I called to check on it and was told it was in and to let them know when I was picking it up and they would have it ready for me. I called yesterday at 3:26pm and told them I would pick it up at 9:00am this morning. I got to the Lowe’s in voorhees, NJ and it was not ready. After waiting a half hour I spoke to the person again asking how much longer. It took another 25 minutes before it was finally ready for me. Taking almost an hour to bring up my order when I notified them in advance I was coming is ridiculous. In the mean time she kept mentioning my dishwasher which I was not picking up and is suppose to be delivered after restrictions from Covid are lifted. Now I’m concerned my microwave and oven never came in either when they were all suppose to be here the first week in April. The other problem I have is that there are signs up saying they are sanitizing the counter and cc stylus between every customer. In the almost hour I was sitting at customer service I did not see them wipe anything down once. I even saw one of the associates pull their mask down, wipe their face and then pull their mask back up and without even cleaning her hands before going back to help customers. Also all associates 4 of them switched back and forth between the registers several times while I was sitting there and again none of them cleaned their hands or wiped down any of the registers. You are not taking proper protocols to limit the spread of covid.More issues continuing May 13thI am having major issues with your voorhees store. I ordered appliances on March 15th to be delivered the first week in April. Supposedly they were in stock but I asked the delivery to be pushed off a bit due to a delay in my kitchen. Now I have been trying to contact them for delivery and I’m getting told only 1 out of the 3 appliances are in. How is that the case when they were suppose to be in over a month ago. I need them delivered on May 20th and I can’t seem to get a straight answer on whether that can happen. Yesterday I spoke to someone and he was suppose to check the status and call me back, but he never did. I called today and was put on hold for a half hour with no one picking up. Then it took me almost another half hour to even get someone on the phone again and she told me she was to busy and the most she could do is put a note in saying we want it on May 20th with no guarantee.

Lowe's Companies,EXCEPTIONAL EXCELLENCE BY JOSE VASQUEZ AND LOWE'S,"I'm 82 years old. My dream for many years was to have wood floors installed in my home in Cedar Park, Texas. So I went to the Lowe's in Cedar Park, and the good people at Lowe's helped me pick the wood for the first floor. They sent out Jose Vasquez of floor access to rip out the decades old carpet and install the floors. It was a big job, but Mr. Vasquez and his team were extremely professional. The quality of the installation was exceptional. I liked it so much that I went back to Lowe's and asked that Mr. Vasquez and his team do the second floor. My entire house now has wood floors. They are gorgeous. The workmanship is outstanding. I want to publicly acknowledge Mr. Vasquez and Lowe's for making my life a little better. With COVID-19, I can't get out anymore. I spend lots of time in my house. I love my house.Best,Mrs. Modak",0,5
Lowe's Companies,Extended warranty and poor quality.,"I did not realize Lowe’s had such poor reviews. Buyer beware. Bought a Whirlpool Gold French door refrigerator in Jan 2017 with extended warranty. It stopped working in March 2019. Took a week for Diamond repair services to properly fix it including replacing the main control panel. Had to throw out every product in the because of the excessive delay in repair. Lowe’s won’t cover the cost if you use a more timely and accurate company. Here we go again. Refrigerator stopped working on 5/8. Diamond came out I. 5/12. Failed to properly fix. The service person said business had been slow, Diamond claims they can’t come any sooner than yesterday. Geez get a decent repair company. In the midst of a pandemic and food shortage all food is again spoiled and Lowe’s will only reimburse up to $300. Last time I buy a product from Lowe’s. ABT here I come.",0,1

Yesterday I received a box marked 2/2 containing just 4 cubes with doors indicating that the order had been shipped in two boxes. I have not received the first box which should have contained the remaining 6 cubes. I emailed their customer care and received a reply saying that box is not being monitored at this time. I attempted to call their customer service twice and was kept on the line for well over half an hour and never was able to speak to a person.

Lowe's Companies,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,"I recently ordered a burgundy colored storm door and handle from Lowes over the internet. The door indicated about 7-10 days before getting to my store Located in Seabrook, NH. To my amazement, it arrived in a day or so. Reading the e-mail sent to me, I discovered all that arrived was the lock set. I am sure that was already in stock. I had no use for the doorknob without the door so I did not jump into the car to pick it up. Just about a week after the door was suppose to arrive it finally came and they sent me another message. ""Bring ID and your order number along with identification"", the two emails indicated. I printed them took my ID and ran to Lowes. Pandemics bring new rules and so I dutifully stood in line. Finally it was my turn, I handed the clerk my two emails and showed my ID. That was only the start of my long long wait until they asked if I had received notice to pick them up. It was obvious they could not find them. While waiting I saw as many as 6 Red vested employees standing around the cash register staring at the screen as though my door would magically appear before their eyes. I heard one of them say, ""Well, I dunno."" Meanwhile no work was getting done including finding my door & handle. Meanwhile four other people behind me were waited on and left with their orders. None of the store employees said much of anything to me except ""are you sure you were told it was in?"" Now I am a little upset. Yes, it was finally found ....both pieces. I will not be ordering items from Lowes anytime soon. Customer Service does not really exist as it is intended.. When I asked, ""Why did it take so long"" I was told that ""someone"" put it in the wrong place. Not a good answer.",0,1

Called the store I thought I ordered from to see if i could pick up the 2 saw horses I ordered which I need badly. I'm trying to get by!! Was told they were out of stock even though the website says 3. I was told to call another store. The lady was rude and said they were being shipped from a vendor. Now I have no idea what is happening, when they will be shipped and they have my money!! I can't even cancel the order!! I suggest Home Depot.

I went there with my child just to pick up some roses and it didn’t even take 2 minutes for me to get it and I was at the register and she just lock the gate knowing that I was checking out. She asked the cashier to close and I had to walk all the way to the other side of Lowe’s with my child to check out while my car is parked by the garden section. She could have told me before she lock the gate and I would be so happy to just leave. Will never come back to this place ever again.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Terrible service,Unfortunately it will not allow me to give a zero. This is about the store in Waterloo Iowa what a joke. I’ve had a credit card there for a long period of time and service is just gone down the toilet. My card had been damaged and I tried multiple times including having them request in store to get me a new car. On every other occasion they’ve just been able to type in the numbers and give me a temporary sheet. When I got to the checkout I told them that was probably going to happen and they just shrugged her shoulders. Of course my items for the garden center would not go through on the card like usual but they were absolutely no help. They suggested I do the online text to recover my number with the barcode which of course didn’t work. Because there was a line behind me and there were items that I needed I went ahead and put it on my debit card and there was no offer for a discount even though I obviously have a Lowe’s card. I went to customer service and they were even more unhelpful and rude. I guess I don’t have to worry about the fact they never want to replace a card for someone who has spent thousands of dollars there every year. I’m done I just need to close the account.Absolutely terrible customer service rude employees they were basically standing around doing nothing except chatting. There needs to be a major overhaul of that store.,0,1

Lowe's Companies,Horrible Experience (Online Ordering / Curbside Pickup / Pickup / Burbank Store),"Where to begin... I ordered my same day pick items online on Friday morning (bug/weed spray and adhesive, 6 items). After noticing the status never changed on your website (showed item at store). I tried calling several times to see if was ready for pickup Friday afternoon/evening. Nobody would pick up the phone. Saturday morning I tried a again a few times and finally got someone to pick up only to be told I would get email when it was ready (a day late). I got an email that it was ready a few hours later. I ordered from it from Lowe's solely to use your curb side pick up. When I arrived all the spaces were full and nobody was waiting in there car... I waited for a spot, then called the number and there was no option to enter and ext. before, during or after the voice prompt (extremely frustrating). So I had go into the store anyway to pickup my items. I was the second person in line when I walked in. There was only one girl doing the pickup and she seem to be completely overwhelmed and didn't have a clue on what they guy in front of me had for pickup. After calling for a manager several times, she left and didn't return for very long time. Finally after 30 minutes or more standing there as the second person in line. The line behind me grew to more than 30 people. Finally some guy that was not previous there assisted me, he pulled my order and told me that only part of it was available.... I wasn't notified of a partial order being filled (again extremely frustrating). I would have cancelled it and save myself ton of frustration. He even told me go look in the store for it myself. The whole point of ordering it online and picking up was so I didn't have to do that. This will be last time I'll ever go to Lowes in mylife time.",0,1

Absolutely astonishing.The last rep ended up redirecting me back to the gift card company, so I went full circle.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's doesn't seem to care about protecting the public from COVID 19,"The Lowe's on Plainfield Ave NE in Grand Rapids, Michigan is located less than a mile from our home. My husband and I have made frequent purchases there over the last four years, including appliances, building supplies and replacement doors. We have always found the staff to be helpful and the store well-stocked.However, we are quite concerned about behaviors of employees in relation to guidelines for the prevention of the spread of Covid-19. As you know, Michigan has been one of the states most impacted by this pandemic and our governor has now extended the stay at home order through May 28. My husband and I are both over the age of 60 and I am a health care provider so am well aware of the increased risk to my age group.On Sunday, May 3 I went to the Plainfield store to pick up an order from the service desk. I noted signage regarding social distancing, wearing masks and assurance that Lowe's is doing everything they can to protect employees and customers. I also noted that there was a television showing the service desk area with a notation that anyone in that area was being recorded. There were several employees walking back and forth from behind the plexiglass at the counter with their masks under their chins. The employee who was assisting me would pull her mask back and forth from her face to under her chin, talking to those around her. Obviously, the purpose of wearing a mask in a place of business is to PROTECT OTHERS and in not wearing a mask properly and then talking over, coughing or breathing on customer purchases is NOT protecting them from possible spread of the disease.When I came home that day I called and asked to speak to a manager. The gentleman I spoke with said he would speak to the staff about wearing their masks in compliance with the recommended guidelines.On Wednesday, May 6 my husband and I went to the store to pick up an order. We did have the option to stay in our vehicle and call into the store, however, as we were purchasing a door we wanted to go in and look at one that was in stock. We arrived at 6 am (the time set aside for older or chronically ill customers). The disinfecting wipe canister for carts at the front of the store was empty. We notified an employee walking by. He acknowledged our request but when we left the store 30 minutes later the canister had not been replaced. There were several employees at the service desk and once again I noted that some were wearing their masks under their chins or taking them on and off. The employee who assisted us (the receipt said her name is Patty) was pulling her mask up and down, touching her face around her nose and mouth and then handling our order. When we had a question about the number of items on the order she came from behind the plexiglass with her mask down under her chin and walked up to my husband (less than three feet). When he asked her to please put her mask up she put it up only over her mouth, not her nose. I certainly do not know what she was thinking, but it appeared disrespectful to a customer to not completely cover her face.Today I called Lowe's again and spoke with a manager by the name of Rich. After relaying my concerns he said ""These are difficult times and we are doing the best we can."" I responded that clearly they were NOT doing everything, since reviewing videotape of employees would be a simple way to determine who is and who is not following the guidelines to protect all of us. I wonder if the store management is actually on board with the Covid-19 guidelines.",0,2

Lowe's Companies,I was very disappointed with my…,"This is sad that you are getting one star across the board reviews from what i read. I read them all. That tells me you don't care about your clients. Home Depot is my choice. It's not because of your pricing. I don't mind spending a little extra to meet my needs. Its the attitude and lack of motivation on the part of your staff.I was very disappointed with my experience at the Corona Ca Branch on Magnolia Ave near 91 freeway. I went there instead of Home Depot on the recommendation of my co worker. I understand everyone is busy during these difficult times and I acknowledge that to the representative. He was helping a co worker who was using a forklift for safety reason. I get that. Home Depot does it too.What disturb me was I was going to purchase a large order and he assure me he was going to assist me after his task. I'm not fussy, but customer comes first. But I was patient. He saw me waiting 30 minutes later but made no attempt. By then, customers came later wanting the same things I wanted, reducing my quantity. Even they were not acknowledge. I decided to take my business back to Home Depot. I was willing to pay a little more to meet my needs. I just felt blowed off. So sad. This happened on May 7th about 2-3 pm. It was a white guy, brown hair, helping in lumber to screen for safety reasons. I understand he was busy, but request assistance if needed. But to wait 45 minutes and no acknowledgement as promised is sad. I rather pay more to get assistance at Home Depot. I'm sorry I listened to co worker. It almost cost me a client today.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I bought a push self propelled lawn…,I bought a push self propelled lawn mower. April 24 2020. It does not start the rope you pull it won't pull. I called them a woman was so mean. I found my receipt they still won't take it back. It's brand new and won't start. They want me to sifen or suck out the gas or they won't take it back. $300. I'm 55. I brought it back with a receipt. I guess now I have to go stuck the gas out of it horrible nightmare. Horrible customer service. All I can do is cry. Never do business with those people.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. LOWES IS TRASH!!!,"I placed an order with lowes.com on April 4th 2020. The items included an outdoor rug, 2 chairs and a table all for a balcony. The items were from the brand Keter and the rug from Safavieh.I receive tracking information for the rug, and it showed up within a week. The rug was stained upon arrival but being that it was an outdoor rug I washed it off and made due. The table and chairs still showed shipping was in progress but I never received any tracking. After a week of calling Lowes 800 numbers and being told by 3 different representatives that they had no idea where the products were, they supposedly were reaching out to the vendor, Keter, but couldn't get any response from that company either...I finally got annoyed and asked that the items be refunded. The 3rd rep supposedly processed the refund. Another week goes by and I see no refund in my account. I decide to reach out directly to their executive Marvin Ellison by email at (Google won't allow email addresses so if you want to email the CEO here is his email address simply change the ""at"" to @ and use this name I've provided) MARVIN.ELLISON at LOWES.COM to find out where my money was and why a billion dollar company couldn't do a simple damn refund. I got contacted the next day by an executive rep named Bakari (useless as tits on a bull) who processed my refund of $210.56 and told me it would be 10 days to see it hit my card. 10 days later I only received a $159.98 refund out of the $210.56 that was owed to me for the 3 pieces of items that Lowes, Lowes.com and all vendors had no clue of where they went, or if they shipped etc. After reaching out to the same rep at Lowes Executive offices, Bakari, he dismissed my initial demand for the remainder of my money stating again that it would be 10 business days. The 10 days were over finally and as it is now May 6th, 2020 he finally reached out and said they would issue another refund for the difference of $50.58 that Lowes owes me. I am now waiting for this part of MY MONEY THAT WAS PAID OVER A MONTH AGO FOR PRODUCT NOT SENT ETC. HERE IS THE BASIC ON THIS: DONT SHOP LOWES. AND ESPECIALLY DONT SHOP LOWES.COM AS THEY HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS RECEIVE THEIR PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT DAMAGED OR 2ND HAND, AND WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG THEY DONT CARE AT ALL ABOUT HELPING YOU AS A PAYING CUSTOMER. I WISH I HAD READ THEIR REVIEWS HERE FIRST BEFORE PURCHASING FROM THEM. IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE. CLEARLY 1.5 STARS SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU CARE ABOUT IT, I FOUND AN EQUALLY NICE FURNITURE SET NOT MADE BY KETER ON WALMART.COM, AND THE ITEMS WERE SHIPPED AND ARRIVED IN 5 DAYS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ARE SITTING NICELY ON MY BALCONY. USE WALMART OR HOME DEPOT IF YOU ARE THINKING OF MAKING A PURCHASE HERE. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!",0,1

After waiting there 25 minutes I finally was told the grill was not there. Back into the store I go the customer service woman was trying to give me a two burner grill instead of the three burner grill I purchased, not to mention it had another customers name on it. After receiving an email informing me that my merchandise was ready for pick up I just did not understand this rat race i was going through. I finally asked to speak to a manager, I was informed by numerous employees there was no manager and they can’t find one. I waited another 45 minutes when a manager by the name of Chris who refused to give his last name is informing me they do not have my order but would give me a floor model. I get the floor model home only to discover the grill is all scratched , needless to say I will be RETURNING IT TODAY! I also ordered a grill cover which I am now discovering is the wrong item!, it’s pretty sad that they can’t even match up item numbers that are on the package!

I called back a while later and after more than 5 minutes was able to speak to a person who said the shingles wouldn't be delivered until at least the 8th which is two days later than Wednesday. Since I had made arrangements for help taking off the old roof, and need to get a dumpster in after the shingles this is more than a little inconvenience.

Upon arriving I was able to Park fairly close to the front door, there was a young man, using that term loosely, collecting a cart. Sucked up a big mouth of snot and spit it on the ground right in front of the door, this was a Lowes employee.

Lowe's Companies,Defective Product,"A couple of weeks ago, I purchased a small metal building from the Lowe's in Paragould Ar. It was in my opinion a bad decision on my part, I shop at Lowe's a minimum of 3 times weekly, mostly for smaller things needed around my home. Never had a problem with the products i bought there. Until now. I paid exactly $347.71 for this 8x10 metal storage building, It took 3 days to assemble i did exactly as the instructions described. Then anchored it to the ground. 2 days later we had some small gust of wind during the night the next morning it was gone except for the 4 bottom rails i had affixed to the ground. The problem with this product was with the screws they supplied to assemble it about 1200 of them too small to keep anything together. The company must not have did a review of the product themselves. Before you even take it out of the box its Junk. I lost trust in this company for selling such a worthless product out of it's store.On my receipt it says the name of the product is 98483 10-8 Highpoint Arrow. I called the store, waste of more time. I would advise anyone to look elsewhere when it comes to this type of product. I'm 56 years old and it's the first time i've felt compelled to write about something like this.I'll not have to again, i'll take my business elsewhere. Lesson Learned!",0,1

Totally different product than I ordered... Shipped in the flimsy display box used in the store... 3/4 of the box was filled with packing... HUGE box that I had to haul back to Lowe's. Clerk In Hot Spring, Arkansas store could not have cared less. I asked for information to speak with someone about this poor experience... She said 1800golowes... that was all... So I waited a month for package. No emails. No customer service line accessible under 35 minutes... and two unnecessary trips to Lowe's.

I was informed that half of the ordered was to be delivered and I had to come and pick up the rest of the order. When I called I couldn't get through to a live voice and the system hung up on me. Finally I received a call from a delivery company XPODELIVE. They were making the delivery for Friday. Friday morning the truck broke down, afternoon it was on course for delivery that same day. Never arrived. On Saturday I received another email saying my lumber arrived. When I called the store Sunday morning I was told it was shipped from Oaks, PA to Plymouth Meeting, PA. On Monday at 730am I called the store. A manager told me my lumber would arrive today. I live in East Norriton and the lumber was delivered to a north Wales location even after the store said it corrected everything with the driver. At 1243 pm I received a call from a driver who didn't understand what I was saying and took the lumber back to the store. While the store credited for delivery my lumber is still not here. This isn't service its a disgrace. As long as XPODELIVE is the delivery system I will go back to homedepot. Do not ask for delivery or you too will have heartbreak.",0,1

No fingernails longer than your tongue. Anyway, she kept having to back up and retype and on and on. I literally almost lost it! But wait! My husband has shipped here for years and years. He always got his disabled vet discount. She said, I’m sorry but it’s not under this number. I chimed in and asked her if she had any other way of verifying. Oh no. Now is too late and we deal with CS, that BTW, has a line way too long. Because my husband wasn’t driving, and his veteran status was under that number, he didn’t bring his wallet. So, I said well we have a DB tag with DV on it. No! He was a liar, a lying veteran who was just shy of returning his items. We went back today to return an item. This time the associate never asked if he was a vet. He looked at her and said, do you not do that anymore? Ask for veteran status? She said oh yes we do. Once again, out in the car, he made certain it was on the number given. She said, it’s not there. Day two of losses of over $100 and complete rejection and sad disbelief of what we have become!",0,1

Can anyone tells me if this is a violation of contract since both party have agreed on the price and they have issued me a notification and an invoice #? It may very possible be a glitch on Lowes' end, but they should still honor the price with a loss or provide me with an option of the same price when they restock.

My first delivery date I was given was for (Saturday) April 25th from 8:00 AM-8:00 PM (and the order was coming from the Williamsburg location???), I waited the entire day and received a call at 6:49 PM that “they are unable to do the delivery.” The lady from the Mechanicsville Lowes apologized and said the next day would be Monday, April 27th. She also asked if I would like a morning or afternoon time. I told her I wanted a morning time frame. Again, I awaited and I called at 12:10 and was on hold for over 45 minutes. When I finally reached someone the gentleman called out to store to discover I wasn’t placed on the delivery schedule, that someone had made an error. He apologized and said the earliest day for the next delivery would be April 29th, Wednesday. So for the third time, I made arrangements to stay home for the twelve hour window of 8:00 AM- 8:00 PM. I even called at 2:21 on the delivery day to confirm, the lady at the 1 800 number said the delivery is on schedule between 4:00-8:00. My delivery never arrived! The next day, I went to MY Lowe’s store to resolve the issue, I was basically told to deal with the Williamsburg location about it since the items are coming from them. He stated this happens often (items coming from different locations) and is a “frustration” for them as well. I called Williamsburg Lowes, they seemed clueless about it and wasn’t much help. As I write this now, I have been currently been on hold with Lowes customer care for one hour and 35 minutes and still waiting to get this issue resolved! This is NOT my first overly frustrating ordeal getting products delivered to my home properly. Two months ago, I tried to get a refrigerator delivered, it literally took FIVE times to get it correct –kept coming in damaged. FIVE TIMES! Ridiculous! Update two days later, still not resolved: After being on the phone with a Lowes’ rep for over an hour and half (they basically call out to the stores for you), the Williamsburg Lowes called, talked with a man named Chris. He told me the next delivery date would be a week and half away. I asked for the deliver y fee to be waived and a quicker delivery date since I was wronged three times! He said he would check on it and let me know. He didn’t call back on the same day. I called the next day, he wasn’t available???

Lowe's Companies,To be honest in the past i've had good…,"To be honest in the past i've had good experiences ordering fence materials and decking materials from my local lowes (Pineville NC, Store 0377), but this last batch of lumber I ordered in March 2020 from them was absolute junk. 2/3 of the 60 pressure treated 2x4's i purchased (which I had delivered due to volume) had severe wane on multiple sides, enormous knots that will eventually blowout, in addition to splitting and checking. The (30) 4x4x8 PT posts i ordered were warped, checked and had severe, deep star shaped end checking. This indicates that one end of the stack this wood came from was exposed to the weather for a very long time and was poor quality yellow pine to begin with.The pickets...... well they weren't much better. I'd estimate a 1/3 of the (400) PT 5/8"" thick x 8' tall dog ear fence pickets we ordered were utterly useless. Many had wane (which is totally unacceptable for fence pickets), many were severely warped, checked or too dried out to use (completely dried fence pickets are almost impossible to nail or screw because they split easily). To make matters worse it appears they were running out of boards and threw in a whole slew of pickets that were incredibly thin (1/4"" thick) which compared to 5/8"" is a huge difference. Terrible quality control from whatever crap mill they get their lumber from.Basically after going through this order and having to bring a good chunk back to the store and return it (a major pain even if you have a pickup like me), i can say their pressure treated lumber is absolute junk. What they put in the delivery order (almost $2000 worth of material) looked mostly like scraps from the discard carts they have in the store. The guy who delivered the products to our house (also included 60 bags of cement on a pallet) did not listen to my verbal commands to just place this extremely heavy pallet straight into the garage from the edge. He could have easily done it and instead dropped it down and then tried to push it further in (even though it was clear of the garage door) with his forks. Keep in mind i worked at a Home Depot in high school and had a fork lift license and plenty of experience so i know what i'm talking about. I repeatedly yelled at him to stop but he kept shimming the pallet back and forth and trying to push it further into the garage (again completely unnecessary). This scrapped and gouged our epoxy coated garage floor deeply and he cracked off a portion of the lip of our garage floor where it meets the driveway. Thanks amigo. Guy was a complete moron who could barely speak a lick of English. The McMullen Store in Pineville NC, Store #0377 where we filed our complaint was not helpful. This store is an older smaller store and it shows. The Associates staffing the place are almost all second rate and hide in the back (break room) during store hours, and I know this because you can walk right past the entrance and hear them all back there laughing and carrying on meanwhile there is nobody to be seen out on the floor in many of the departments. This was a huge problem at HD when i worked there and corporate had to lay down the law that if you hide in the back during store hours or walk away from customers your fired.Lowes has slid downhill a long ways. Take your business elsewhere. These guys only care about selling plants, appliances, tools and paint to light weight foo foo DIYers. From now on i'm ordering my lumber from Home Depot or lumber 84. Lowes sucks.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,We had to order new appliances so we…,"We had to order new appliances so we went into the store to order but some of the items we needed were only special pricing online so the store manager suggested we order online. We went home and ordered online. Our order supposedly got split in three different shipments or whatever. One shipment was coming 2 weeks after and the other one was god knows when because it was a special order coming from vendor. My vacuum never had any updates. I called a few days before the delivery of some items to let them know to group it when the refrigerator comes in so I dont have to waste taking much time off from work. When the Refrigerator was supposed to come, I called them asking for an update and they told me the fridge is still unknown from vendor and they had already delivered our washer, dryer and freezer but we never received anything. For one month they kept playing with us about the status of the items. After I confronted them that we never received anything, they started telling me that all the items will be delivered one week after another until I disputed with my credit card. They somehow also have the wrong address on the order and am unsure of how that happened as well. I waste about two months with Laurinburg Lowes delivery team and the assistant and store manager. They also lied about then delivering our fridge only to come up with a hundred excuses as to “well your fridge was delivered in January” “we cant find your fridge” “your fridge is delivered to another Lowes near your home” “we lost your fridge” “we have found it and will be coordinating a day next week for delivery”. Those were the excuses I dealt with. Finally got another Lowes manager to override and give us a refund for the fridge but we are still out of $3000 for the items they so called delivered to god knows where. My only guess is that they Lost the items, Delivered at the wrong place or outright stole it themselves and signed a bogus signature which is not mine. I have been a Loyal Lowes customer until now. I would rather take my high dollar value order to Best Buy because their customer service for something like this is unparalleled and they will do everything to deliver the right items within the same week. Bill Chapman is the delivery driver who claims to have delivered the items not mentioning the fact our vacuums were never delivered nor is their a tracking for us to track. Lowes stole my money and kept the appliances. They are a Thief. I had to scoop up to buy used appliances because I thought Lowes would at least be honest enough to refund my money. But I was wrong. During this coronavirus pandemic, I have lost $3000 I so Dearly needed In this time. I have never felt so disheartened. I want my money back.",0,1

FINE! We go to pay for the new set, and the computers are down. I complained to the manager about the ordeal and she gives me 10% off. I fill out the carbon copy transaction as the computer were still down and so we didnt have to wait. Next day, Lowes charged me full price and not what the carbon copy receipt says. I go BACK to lowes and explained everything again, the same lady refunded me immediately. 5 days later the switch of the washer sets are done. A few days later, I still dont have a refund. I called several times and they all tell me different wait times for refunding over $1000. 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days then the manager tried to tell me 20 day. After giving them an earful as i was LIVID, the manager puts me on hold to ""check"" my refund. When she returns, I remind her that she was not about to give me a false update as she NEVER took my information down to provide me with an update, so the lady was lying and giving me some fake update. I get transfer to someone else and she finally tells me the refund is pending. A week later, still no refund. So they better believe I will be back in their store tomorrow. NEVERRRR SHOP HERE.

I go back to the store with the plant the following day up to the customer service counter to get my money back. I shop some more, find another plant and this time they charge me $5 for the dead plant I just brought in and another $5 for an additional dead plant I bought.

Lowe's Companies,Our Murray,"Our Murray, Utah Lowe's store is very very poorly managed. Consistently, long before the Covid19 pandemic, the store had no regard to customers who wanted to pay for their merchandise. There have always been unreasonably long lines. Now, with Covid19 in place, I went twice in two successive days to the Garden Shop to get a couple of items. It took 30 minutes to check out on the first day and 28 minutes on the second day. By comparison, I also purchased one item at Home Depot and it took only 4 minutes to check out. Lowe's could be a good store, but new management is needed. When I was able to speak with the manager on duty that day, April 29, 2020, I asked why he is unable to hire another cashier (only one is available in the Garden Shop despite that there are two checkout stations that are divided by complete partitions) when 16 million people are out of work, he just said is ""trying"".

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Online Ordering and Delivery Process is Out of Whack; Don't Waste Your Time!,"Like another recent contributor, I've had good in-store shopping experiences with Lowe's over the last several years; used their products and equipment to remodel a kitchen and a bathroom. I have some outdoors projects underway, now, and turned to Lowe's to provide the materials. I ordered everything online a couple of weeks ago, but realized not everything was marked for delivery. Called CustomerCare and they promptly fixed the issue, changing everything to delivery. THEY told me it would all be delivered on April 29th. I took vacation time to get ready for the shipment and to be able to work on the project; also had a couple of helpers waiting with me to accept the shipment. I had an 8am to 8pm delivery window so I was stuck at home ALL DAY waiting for the delivery, but no one ever showed up and no one ever called. Next morning I called the local Lowe's store from which the order was to be fulfilled, they tell me their records indicate shipment is not to occur until sometime in May, and that CustomerCare should not have given a firm date without checking with local store. The person at the local store was trying to arrange delivery sometime next week, but said he could not direct delivery crew to help put materials in my garage. So, I would have to take another vacation, hire two more helpers, again, to sit around for an unreasonably long 12 hour delivery window, still with no guarantee that the delivery would actually occur. Lowe's made no offer of a discount or any other accommodation for the major inconvenience they caused so I just cancelled the order. Not going to reward gross incompetence with my dollars.",0,1

I told her to cancel my order and she said that she canceled my order. After the employee hung up I waited for the survey so that I could rate her poorly and my experience, but all I received was a recording said that the customer service for this call was terminated... no survey... how convenient. Now 9 days later, I received my canceled order and of course they charged me for it on the same day. UNBELIEVABLE: I CANCELED MY ORDER. i am done with Lowes.

I go to pay for my items at the register the lady rings them up shock surprise didn't come up the price they were supposed to be. I tried explaining to her that the man in the garden section said these were the right ones she did not want to listen and just continue to ring them up. So I didn't want to make all the people standing behind me wait in that hat store with masks on their face any longer. So something that was supposed to only cost me $6 cost me $24 plus tax. And just to top it off as I'm leaving the guy that was really ignorant was in the parking lot getting the shopping carts I didn't want to be ignored and just leave the cart anywhere so I went to give it to him with the other carts that he was Wheeling but he looked at me like I was crazy it wouldn't take the cart.

Will they did come and pick up the broken one but stated they did not have the replacement in stock and could not tell them when they would have one. My parents then asked for a refund for the washer. After weeks of calling the store to talk to the store manager , the salesman, and customer service line they were hung up on and transferred to line that did not answer. Finally they got a hold of the store manager and he told my elderly parents that they would have to come into the store and bring the card they bought the washer with to have the refund placed back on the card. To ask my elderly parents to come into the store during the COVID-19 outbreak is unbelievable. Their grandson did take the card into the store for them and was instructed that the refund was completed and placed back on the card. Well 2 weeks later no refund. Many attempts by phone again and no response , hung up on , and transferred to worthless numbers. Finally they got an email that the refund was placed on a gift card that would take up to 2 weeks to receive in the mail. They do not need a gift card to a store that so blatantly treated them with such disrespect and destain for their health. !!! DO NOT BUY APPLIANCES FROM LOWES ESPECIALLY IF YOUR ARE ELDERLY !!!!!

I have followed their instructions and still not solved. I have been a loyal customer to them over all others. My recommendation don’t buy there or the warranty it’s a joke.

I called the store and was told it would be ready in 4 more days. After 4 days heard nothing. After multiple tries I got hold of the store again. I was placed on hold and my call was dropped. Multiple further attempts throughout the day and I finally spoke to someone at the store. Was told that the order had not yet even started. The final straw was when they tried to tell they had been trying to contact me and had made several calls. This is not true. I asked them to cancel the order.

Lowe's Companies,"Pick up Service in Parking lot, what a joke","I have used Lowe's for years, normally I like shoppping there. They are helpful and i can wiz in and out in no time. But, this time, I still cannot beleive it happen this way. So, I put an order on line during the COVID-19 and choose Lowe's because they said they have Pick up Service. I got my message from Lowe's the following day saying it was ready for pickup, great. Drove to the store, pulled in the parking spots for pickup and call the number and extension on the sign to state that I was outside. Note, that I was the only car in all there parking spots, estimate probably 8 spots for pickup, called about 50 times the number they said to call, no answer, finally I called the Customer Service number, again another 50 time, no answer there either. So I walked into Lowe's where the Customer Service counter is but there were about 10 other people waiting in line so there I stood, right in the path with all the other customers were walking into Lowes, felt like I was a greeter for them. While I was nearing the Customer Care Center I saw another Lowe's employee pass by and I told her I was here only to pick up my item, she than told the only Customer Service Employee at the counter, who call the Manager to the store as I was telling him my story in front of others, what a way to have to get help. They said they would than be out to my car with my order. Ten minutes later my ordred arrive by a sweet young girl. I thanked her and told her I so appricated her. But, you need to know if there pick up sounds great as it did for me, it's the worest by far as I have used many compainies during the COVID-19, I haven't walked into a store for 2 months trying to stay healthy but thank you Lowe's for making you the only company that advertise drive up, pick up and don't provide it. It took me a little over 1 hours from the time I drove into their parking lot till I left there parking lot. I have never had worest customer service and to have them do this with there curbside pickup service, either do it correctly or please, don't say your here to help customers because it only made it worse and me being the only one in your Pick UP Parking Spot, really, Lowe's can't you do better than that!!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Ever Declining Customer Service!,"Being in construction I frequent the box stores regularly. However on on April 2nd I ordered 3 items from Lowes.com. It was supposed to ship from a local store in Charlotte so I would not have to go in the store with the covid-19 restrictions. It originally said delivery would be April 6-9. I thought ok that's just a couple days and I could wait. The items never showed up so I called customer service. The lady I spoke with was not very friendly and was kind of rude. She said well it is showing her to be delivered April 12-14. I said ok and asked why the website said something different. Again got a smart answer from her basically saying I didn't know what I was talking about. I have the order print out! So I waited, the items said out for delivery on April 14. I waited at home all day. Nothing showed up. I called Fed-Ex. They said not all of the items had shipped the only thing they had for delivery was an attachment for the weed eater I ordered. Ironically enough, they lost it and shipped it to Phoenix AZ after it was in Charlotte out for delivery. So again I called Lowes to ask about the 2 other items. Come to find out they never shipped they couldn't tell me when or how they were shipping. I asked for a refund and for them to recall that shipped item since the 1 item was lost and the smart A$$ lady on the phone said well it doesn't work like that. There is a process. I said yeah, you got my money I have no merchandise. It had been 15 DAYS at this point. I called Lowes corporate complaint department at that point. Spoke with a lady who looked into everything and could not tell why the order had not shipped. I got every excuse under the sun for the past 2 weeks. This lady said she would call me back the next day with an answer and a resolution. All I asked at this point was to let me go to the local Lowes and get my items since it was in stock. Well guess what, that was not an option as there is a process! So needless to say I NEVER got the promised phone call. and since it was the end of the day Friday, I knew nothing would happen over the weekend either. Monday came and I called Lowes corporate customer service again. Got another lady who again was NOT very friendly. She did check and let me know the item shipping label was created and should be shipping that day. So allegedly it is on it way to me for delivery tomorrow which will make 22 days since I ordered and the order said April 6-9. This is totally unacceptable. I remember when Lowes had the best customer service online as well as in store. Apparently something has changed in the corporate dynamics for employee attitudes to present itself to their customers. Needless to say, I will drive across town and go to Home Depot from now on. After every excuse under the sun, I did let the rep know my Home Depot order came in 4 days with no problems as it was ordered on the same day. If they had the brand of trimmer I wanted, I would have ordered from them. Lowes has a LOT of work to do with service, attitudes and instore help! Buyer beware!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Worst EXPERIENCE EVER!!,"I bought what I read was a brand new pool online.. I get it, set it up, and Start to fill it with water, & sure enough there’s a hole in the bottom. I take a second look, and you can see where someone tried to tape it up, and burn the plastic together. Again, it was supposed to be a brand NEW pool! So after me and my fiancé wasted like 20/30 gallons of water, we have to drain it out to take it back. The lady I spoke to, her name was Dashayla, told me to be there before 5, because she gets off at that time. It was 4:15 when I called her, and still had to drain the pool... but she promised a discount, and that they did have another pool to order me, and it’ll all be taken care of as long as I get there before 5. & I that should get my discount back today, but the pool would take about a week to receive once ordered today... & that she would relay my message to the manager. Okay, fine, I understand. So, after rushing, me and my fiancé get there by 4:45. We rush inside, and the assistant manager is actually right at the door telling people when to come in. ( they could only have a certain amount of people in the store at a time due to the virus) anyways. I explain to him everything that happened, and what I was told they would do to help me. The assistant manager had no clue what I was talking about. & rudely explained to me that it was basically my fault because I ordered online. & that I could not receive a discount today. I’m sorry, but what does me ordering online have to do with anything? You put your name on the products, & allllll your merchandise in the store comes from some sort of online/ outside company. You mean to tell me that you don’t pride yourself in all your products in the store or online? Also, you refunded me for the pool, how could you not give me a discount today, or offer me a gift card or anything? & because the pool I ordered isn’t considered “essential” I could not reorder another one to receive that, or to receive my discount. Also, that I should try Academy or Walmart. Well are they (Lowe’s)going to give me a gift card to those places? Why would I do that if I was promised a discount? & trust me, I understand this all completely, but the woman I spoke to on the phone, Dashayla, told me there was indeed another one. & I could order it today. Along with other promises ( this woman never even came to speak with me either). The assistant manager proceeded to tell me that he was sorry for the misinformation, but that it basically wasn’t his fault. So you mean to tell me, you don’t aide in training your employees? You don’t care how they reflect your business and give false information? That’s pathetic. The other manager that helped was a man named,Daniel. He was extremely rude. He made a comment stating “ I’m sorry, pools aren’t essential, but I guess it is to you!” I straight up told him that if I pay for something I want it to be right. & that my money is essential, so therefore, if I buy stuff from your business, with my essential money, it is essential. I was completely taken back by the amount of rudeness, and horrible misguided information. I know I may have been upset because of the situation, but if you are human, and realize the whole situation was messed up, then you need to be nice, do your job, and not make excuses. At the end of it all. I got my refund, but did not get to reorder the same pool that I was told they would, & didn’t receive my discount.Again, I would’ve been fine with a gift card ( but Lowe’s wouldn’t do that either). So I made Daniel, write on my refund receipt, his name, and the promise he made to me that I would get 50$ off my new pool when I can order it in the future. & after I receive this, I’m no longer going there again.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes in-store pickup is a joke,"Lowes in-store pickup is a joke. I placed a small order on Friday evening. Received the confirmation over night for pickup on Saturday morning. I waited until after 9 AM and pulled into a specified pick up slot. The slots were not busy. There was a sign giving the slot number, the store phone number and, a 4-digit extension. Called the number. There were no instructions when to put in the extension so I called back and just put in the extension. It took me to department that matched the first digit! It rang and rang, then went to a busy tone.Tried a second time. Same deal.A third time just cycled back to the original answering message.While all this was (not) happening there were several associates outside the doors either on their phones or just avoiding work.By now it had started to rain, so as a last resort, we drove over to a door and got an associate's attention. He took my email copy of the order and directed me to another pick up slot.After nearly 20-minutes and another trip by the associate, I finally got the order and left for home.My opinion (and apparently several other posters') of Lowes is pretty low. Did anyone actually check the pick up system? Does any one actually understand their phone system?Based on my experience, they should deemed non-essential in this state and closed.",0,1

We ordered a truck delivery of drywall supplies to finish the ceilings for kitchen areas that have exposed insulation with a scheduled delivery date of Tuesday. Saturday morning and still no one has returned our multiple calls to reschedule, cancel or provide refund. After an hour + call a customer service agent from the corporate office this morning still couldn’t provide refund or confirm a new delivery date.

Lowe's Companies,Purchased my Father a $2800.00…,"Purchased my Father a $2800.00 Husqvarna Zero Turn mower from the Claypool Hill Virginia store.The first mower the store loaded on his trailer was defective, and gas poured out of it when he stopped on the way home to put gas in it. He immediately returned it back to the store, where they assembled another mower for him. He used the mower once and determined that the zero turn was not suited to the contours of his yard. (They lose control easily on slopes). He went back to the Claypool Hill Virginia Lowes and discussed the issue with the associate that had sold the mower. The associate told him there was a 30 day return window, and for him to bring the mower back. The next day, he returned with the mower, with the intent of getting a regular tractor style Husqvarna mower. Once he had the zero turn unloaded, the Manager of the Claypool Hill store confronted him and told my father he would not sell him another mower because he was a ""RISK"", and kept bringing mowers back. The first mower was defective, and Lowes had a 30 day return policy on the second. I have contacted Lowes Corporate in attempt to get this lovely manager terminated. This is the way the Claypool Hill Virginia Lowes treats their customers. I am a homebuilder, and purchase a large amount of items from Lowes everyday.

The one my driver picked from store was in better shape. They ignored him and just continued loading the bad piece. I wasn't aware of the situation til after we left the parking lot. Didn't have time to exchange it due to my work schedule and lack of access to another haul trailer. With that much cracks in the wood, I don't have any confidence that wooden unit will last me for many years...

I am pregnant and have 2 seniors living at home and cannot risk having my husband around too many people during this pandemic. When my husband went to pick up the order, he followed the directions Lowes provides (park in a curbside parking spot, call the number)..He called over 7 times and no one answered. He finally went in to ask for assistance for curbside pick up and was told that they were too busy to do curbside pick up. This is unacceptable and unbelievable. Why is Lowes advertising pickup curbside if they are not actually fulfilling it? Whether this is a corporate issue or a store issue, I am not sure, but it absolutely needs to be dealt with. My husband was told to wait on a line (with numerous other people who were not standing 6 feet apart). The whole point of placing order by curbside was to not risk standing that close to other individuals. Rather than waiting, he left and we have cancelled our order.Update! I emailed Lowe's ""customer care email"" to receive the following email: Hello, Thank you for your e-mail. Please note this is an automated response and this mailbox is not currently being monitored.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's employee goes outside the box,"Yesterday my husband and I were at Lowe's buying a stove and microwave. I noticed a mirror that I really liked that would go over my new vanity. Don Parr, Louisville's Hurstbourne store was where the sales associate works that helped us. We thought the price was $149.00 on sale from $199.00. I like the mirror a lot. I had been looking and looking for the perfect mirror to match the new vanity we had just bought. When we looked at it further. We noticed it was the Vanity top that was on sale not the mirror. But the price for the mirror was only $48.00. I got really excite that the price was that and not $149.00. We were unable to find the mirror. Don looked and looked. We discover in our search that the price ticket was on the wrong item. The price for the mirror was actually $89.00. The $48 dollar price was for a small medicine cabinet. Well needless to say, my bubble got popped. I was so excited about that price. To make a long story short. Your associated made me very happy. He made an executive decision. Because the price on the mirror was miss marked, He honored that price. My husband and I have probably over the last few years spent thousands of dollars at Lowe's. Siding, Windows, flooring, appliances, paint and tools. I would just like to give my special thanks to Don for stepping up and giving such great customer service. I appreciated him doing this and I wanted Lowe's know how small jester like this well keep us coming back to Lowe's.

Lowe's Companies,Wanted plank flooring installed,"Wanted plank flooring installed. Material and labor contract drawn up. Reviewed contract, noted labor/material to install quarter round after flooring installed...for $495.00. We would do without the quarter round, because would not look correct. We thought looked like cutting corners on installation. Therefore I would remove the baseboards, trim the bottom of door casing to slide planks. Therefore wanted the material/labor items removed. 3 weeks later, Lowe's would not remove the labor/material quarter round from the contract. Matt said that was required as part of the warranty, whatever that means? Long story short, cancelled any work by Lowe's. Bottom line Lowe's is not flexible when comes to working with customers when working out a contract. Most anybody could nail a quarter round into place, but not for $495.00 worth. I agreed to let Lowe's know about my review, maybe will help other people decide about Lowe's contract work.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,I am writing about an issue that I had with Lowes DON'T Use Them,"I am writing about an issue that I had with Lowes at Waxhaw, NC 28173. Three weeks ago I went into the store and met with one of there salesman about ordering a custom sliding screen door for our sliding glass door frame. I took in there a drawing of what the outside dimensions were on the height at 77-3/4"" and width at 37"" and the thickness at 3/8"". That was measured exactly from the old screen door from outside of frame work to outside of framework. We paid for the custom sliding screen door and was told it would be three to four weeks. The door arrived early which was great until I got it home and it was 1-34"" short in height so would not fit. I took it back to Lowes and spoke to the Salesman and we called where it was built by a company called Pila Doors and he went over the details. They said that was built to their standards. They asked me to go back home and take some pictures on the existing window sliding door in which I did. When the salesman at Lowes got hold of them and he gave Pila the information they said that wasn't there brand and they don't build doors that are not their doors. Why wasn't I told this from the beginning with a drawing of the existing sliding screen door I had in which I have wasted my time now three weeks waiting and time going back and forth. I use Lowes a whole lot with my company and now I am telling my employees not to use Lowes unless this matter is rectified. The end results is Lowes is responsible for this and even though Pila makes the doors there policy should have made Lowes aware of this. Lowes does not make sliding Screen doors that are custom and the public needs to be made aware of this that they don't and mis-lead you. I like Lowes a whole lot but this has put a bad taste in my mouth about Lowes. I am writing this review so the Public is very aware of Lowes and also I am sending an email blast to the 38,000 customer I have with my business. Home depot has said they can build us a custom sliding door screen right away and they just need frame to frame outside measurements. If you are needing a sliding screen door to not go to Lowes.",0,1

Not everything can be blamed on COVID19. After waiting for an hour at customer service I walked back to the receiving dock area of the store with some young inexperienced helper. We did not see the claimed water damage (lie) nor any signs of the material. In the pick-up area there was some ugly Trex decking and Iassume someone traded their ugly Trex material for the stuff I had ordered and screwed Lowes over and the intelegent employees are just not fit to understand what they are selling or even doing there.I went to the ""manager"" while ringing up people said :"" hmm, don't know where it could be"", and continued as if I was air.That is what's wrong with our USA. If I were a store owner and had a manager that ignored a very good customer, I would fire him in a heart beat. The only problem is , I would not find another person dumb enough to act smart - while being inefficient, disrespectful of time, and totally uneducated. These Lowes her in the Spartanburg and Greenville SC area are the most toxic environments a person can be in. I left , the store after realizing I had been called in to pick up a product that was not there , stolen or never received. I am debating to sue since this has happened to me before with Lowes in Greer and after two weeks my product arrived and I had to go pick iy up again driving 20 miles for nothing.

I am a busy guy, and I buy supplies because I need them, not because I like playing stupid store games. Lowes was my go to place a couple years ago and I built a house mostly with their products.

We then loaded up the cart with some supplies for our veggi garden. We went inside to get some other supplies and because they don't allow checking out outside anymore. Apparently it's safer to send every customer in the store down one isle and out past the only registers open. We tried to get down a few isles, but there were employees congregated telling war stories, or something like that. We finally got the courage to ask them to disperse and they gave us some attitude. They then informed us that what we were buying was not an essential supply items. That is when we decided to leave our cart of supplies and leave. The employees there obviously think this is all a joke. 75% of them are not wearing masks, just hanging around talking and not restocking carts or helping customers get their items in a safe manner.

After spending almost an hour on the phone that situation was remediated and the additional charge was removed. Today I received the other portion of my order, only to find out that one of my items was missing. I ordered 2 rolls of landscaping edging that was not included in my order (totaling $14.48).

Thus meaning I was overcharged by $50.88. It appears that I was overcharged for my items as well charged an additional delivery fee for my order because it arrived two separate days WHICH I DID NOT CONSENT TO. Also, I’d like to point out that not one of the delivery workers or drivers had on gloves or a mask. They rang my doorbell and required a signature.

Guess what, Robert Hanson showed up and my name was gone. You cannot get a Military Discount unless you have a My Lowe's card or the names match, even if you show a Military ID card.

As a loyal Lowe's customer I am extremely disappointed with this issue. Home Depot offers it no problem why doesn't Lowes? In these trying times when we are asked not go outside because of Covid-19 the least this company can do is follow the lead of their competitors and offer free delivery. I wanted to buy an item for $99 and the shipping was $79!! Are freakin' kidding me. I try to support my local stores but I'll be looking more into Home Depot and Amazon from now on. Shame, because I really liked Lowes and the people that work there are super helpful and nice.",0,1

Today, April, 11, 2011 I was shopping as always and their werent any carts available, I looked and waited and nothing. I then decided to go back into the store because what I needed I couldnt carry by myself. After searching for another 10 minutes, I came across one but it had various item. n it. I asked the other customers and they told me it wasnt there. I started removing the items and then a young man , Loews worker told me he was using the cart and was putting the items back.on the shelf. I apogize and explained to.him my situation. He immediately told me he would empty the carraige and let me use it!!! I thanked him and told he was a great worker, an asset to the store. I asked him his name and he informed me it was Garrett! I had to give him recogntion and tell you of his unselfish act. He literally was carrying all the items he could in his hands and placed the rest on a shelf so he could come back and place them where they belong. Once again Kudos to Garrett and his wonderful kind deed!!! Hopefully you guys in corporate will acknowledge him and once again ypur employees to me are marvelous!!!

Lowe's Companies,Lowes associates working during pandemic.,"Ordered windows from store 2252 in Stroudsburg Pa. Jason at the pro desk was awesome in handling and processing of my order without having to visit the store. So, that's my point here - try not being so critical of folks working during this pandemic.

Lowe's Companies,$1400 for incompetence,"Our new washing machine cost $1400 and was delivered by Lowe’s affiliates who literally didn’t know how to do their job and properly install the machine. They initially claimed to us that we needed to pay for extra parts, which they then found with the machine. After some more fiddling around on another day, they proceeded to continue to fail spectacularly at installing our washing machine and simply told us that it was broken. Our brand new, $1400 washing machine. Broken. Really? Cue them trooping out of our home with no follow up whatsoever. After a couple days, I was able to have another Lowe’s associate come out and look at the machine again. This employee expressed wonder that the machine wasn’t even installed (pretty crazy!) and then completed said installation. At this point we don’t even feel that we can trust that the machine is in perfect working order. Pretty curious that installation took over seven days when it should have taken less than an hour. Overall, I’m feeling frustrated with having to open my home to Lowe’s employees who are so unqualified to do their jobs that they would just rather lie and take their customer’s money. Lowe’s has lost my trust and my future business.",0,1

They chose to trade during the pandemic and the service is still as it was before the worst service for a company offering customer care and customer service. I would rather go to Home Depot as it seems they do give customer service training with the view of customer's as a key to the success of the business. I ordered online a product which when I ordered stated 2 hr curb side pick-up but due to the situation there may be a delay. We have past 24hrs in delay with no communication other than a receipt of payment which they quickly took off the credit card. At this point I will probably return for a full refund and order it from the competition because they care about customer. Lowe's is a joke for customer care.",0,1

I was informed that I needed to go to the back of the long line of people waiting to get in the store to shop.

Today has special instructions for employees and customers because of the Corona virus. when i walked up to the store with my mask on i saw a sign that stated “These carts have been sanitized”; however i saw trash in some of the baskets when i went to select one. i asked at the customer service desk if the carts were sanitized and the man said no we haven’t done that yet. it was noon time. i said to him then take the sign down that says you did sanitize them. there were announcements over the store speaker saying to be sure to keep at least 6 feet distance from each other. customers seemed to be doing just that but not the employees. two of them came down the isle i was on and they were shoulder to,shoulder. i said to them that the distance rule applied to them also they kept right on their merry way. it is hard to get help at this store. so like i said. if i didn’t know about some product i needed to buy i certInly wouldn’t go to this store. i expect the sales force to know at least as much as i know about a product in order to truly help customers.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,Worst experience during Covid 19. Lowe’s is horrible!!!,"My wife and I spent thousands on new flooring 10 months ago. It took awhile to get the flooring installed due to having a kid in August and having to move things around the home to get the project done. After completing, we have 10 boxes left over. I tried returning them and their computer says that there was already a full refund on the product. Come to find out, this was an error on their part because the store I bought it from messed up on the invoice and put the wrong color (same brand) of flooring on original invoice. That same store had to switch that in their computer which basically made it look like there was a full refund in their system. In order for them to fix this, they would have to call the IT department and have them help with he bar code issue. Don’t forget that we bought this 10 months ago which is passed the 90 day return policy... I know! Mind you, when we bought this flooring, that was not enforced at all. Now that they have to get into the computer and actually do some work, they want to enforce it on a small family dealing with this Covid 19 virus and out of work. They don’t want to try and help, just point out that it’s passed the 90 days. The flooring is still stocked in their store and being sold. The boxes I have are brand new and were kept inside my garage so can easily be resold at their store. Only point I guess I’m trying to make here is that if an employee or manager at these stores had a family member in this predicament, I can guarantee you, this would be no issue. Not to mention, this 500 dollars would really help a family like mine... what’s 500 dollars to Lowe’s. I would think they’d like to help a customer out!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Wow. I am astonished at how terrible this company can be.,"We ordered some things online with promises it would be shipped within 1-3 days. It has now been 4 days and it has not been shipped. Totally understandable that shipping times are behind with everything going on BUT my complaint lies with the fact that the order dates were misleading, we cannot email the company or cancel the order online, wait times for the call centers are over 3 hours long and the shipping cost more than the items we bought. This leaves us with no choice but to wait any amount of time for our items when we could have just gone in store and purchased them 4 days ago. Lowe’s has completely lost my business. I hate this store and their asinine and useless customer service tools.",0,1

He actually walked the phone to customer service were they argued, and I got disconnected again. Called again told them not to forward my call, and that I needed two pallets of mulch delivered, I was told that I need to do that online. Before I could explain the website wont let you order mulch online, she hung up. Last call I made, got put on hold because she was on another transaction, 30 minutes later while waiting patiently, I was disconnected (or hung up on). Do these people know what customer service is?

Lowe's Companies,my Lake Wales Lowe's,"I much more prefer to walk around my Lake Wales Lowe's rather than their competitor's, and I really appreciate and applaud them for the military discount; however, I have issues with a few things to the point of actually having to write this review. Note: I just also realized that Lowe's doesn't have a feedback for reviews and complaints or suggestions; so, I will have to look for a back door or find a more public review site. No luck, the only back door is a product review limited to 50 characters, As much as I like the stores; Lowe's has a terrible online order tracking system (which is only surpassed by their almost impossible to find items in their ""search for"" system). I ordered a Jigsaw on Nov 10th 2019. their order status tracking page shows it as still being shipped but not yet delivered (even though I've been using it for four months or more. The Benchtop Sander ordered on Mar 23rd 2020 shows it as being delivered; however, it also showed it as being delivered when in fact it was still being shipped (causing me to call and ask where the heck it went to). The table saw stands (which for some unknown reason could only be shipped to store) ordered on Mar 28th 2020 was supposed to be at the store for pickup already but no email updates or tracking info is available (the status page shows it as ""Arriving at store"" for days. I may have to call to find out if it actually arrived or not (meanwhile my scroll saw and sander are sitting around waiting to be put on the stands and my projects are on hold). My recommendation to Lowe's is ""If you want to keep competing with HD and possibly Amazon, you definitely need to improve your order status method of operation with one that actually works andchange the way your search engine works so that it actually finds the searched for items that really are in stock or available online; but, when searched for, you constantly end up with a not found result."" My workarounds would be to use more tags for the products searched for so it doesn't have to be found by repeatedly using different terms and by accident stumbling over it on a hit or miss entry. When a product is ordered make home delivery more available...I don't appreciate having to drive 30 miles to pick up something I could have ordered from somewhere else cheaper and with home delivery included. When the products are shipped give the customer an email notification AND a tracking number so it can be located in real time. This does not negate the fact that your order status page is in serious need of staying on top of those orders accurately. As much as I would like to support my local brick and mortar stores you can't expect to have an inadequate search, order, and delivery service and keep customers satisfied and loyal to you. That's my view and review, R G, Lake Wales, FL",0,3
Lowe's Companies,Never shopping at Lowes again!,"I have never written a review before but have never dealt with such an incompetent group in my life! I almost don’t even know where to begin.

Gal at customer service wasn’t paying attention and cancelled my entire order so then I stand there for an hour redoing order. This reorder pushes my delivery date out an additional week. Get msg night before that delivery is next day. I drive 2 1/2 hours to be at delivery site, no delivery and no call. Call Lowe’s, they have canceled delivery because range isn’t in store yet. They do this 3 more times. I finally have to beg them to deliver just the fridge because my son has been without one for 4 weeks now. I had to pick up dishwasher myself. Yesterday I get msg that I am second in line for delivery of range. This morning get another msg that they will be there within hour. No one shows. I call delivery service and they tell me Lowe’s canceled the delivery. WTH, WHY??? 4th time they have done this with not a phone call or msg. I call Lowe’s, am on hold 45 minutes, then hung up on.

Lowe's Companies,Terrible experience at the Eastlake…,"Terrible experience at the Eastlake Lowes in Chula Vista, CA. Trying to find face masks for my husband and myself. We're both elderly (I'm 69 and he's 72) with underlying medical conditions. We do have to go out once a week at most to get groceries, however, and some medical supplies. Trying to find delivery services that work but no real luck as of yet. My husband is a Viet Nam vet and we did recently get a military discount at Lowes - which we were for grateful for; a clerk helped us with this (all before COVID 19. Lowes' computer site for the Eastlake store shows that there are many face masks available. I wasn't sure if this was accurate and, so, I tried calling the Eastlake store many times yesterday but no one would answer (tried calling many different departments during their store hours; no one picked up). So, we went to the store in person this morning - not one mask available. Clerk said they haven't had masks for weeks and he was aware of the misinformation on their computer site. I am much appalled/traumatized by this experience today. I wonder if Lowes realizes that they are losing costumers with this type of misinformation. They need to update their computer sites daily and they need to answer their phones at the store. They have lost us as customers and I will tell my family and friends about this experience - so probably more lost customers for them. I wonder if Lowes' shopping site is nothing more than a ""come on"" to lure people into their stores. Do they even know what customer service is or its value. Horrible.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes in Sanford,"Lowes in Sanford, Florida I wasn't sure if it was discrimination or bad customer service, but after reading the reviews I will chalk it up to bad customer service.I went into Lowes yesterday because I needed a dishwasher and wanted to get one before everything is shut down due to Covid 19, the gentleman was standing behind the counter in the appliance section I asked him about a dish washer he couldn't hear my question and asked me to repeat so I did thinking he was keeping his distance because of the virus... Imagine my dismay when he left from behind the counter and instead of continuing to help me find a product that was right for me he walked over to a caucasian couple stood within a foot of them, and proceeded to help them and walking them back over to the counter.When I said something about it he asked with a slight yell and irritation in his voice ""What do you want"" I slightly yelled back ""a dishwasher"" "" what I have already told you"", at that point I walked away from Chris to go and speak to a manager.An employee was walking towards me I said ""I need a manager"" "" can you get me a manager"" that employee said ""you are going to have to wait"" "" neither one of us can talk to you right now"" I said to my husband let's just go to another store that manager (Scott) said "" yeah! Go to another store"" which led to a verbal altercation between my husband and Scott.And after reading the comments I would say this is a running theme with Lowes, and they don't value their customers.I went to the (Fern Park) Casselberry, Florida store and their customer service was awesome, and James was great I spent close to $800.00 on a black stainless steel dishwasher it will be delivered the 14th we will see how that goes.",0,1

We would've just delayed the date with them without issue but they instead just cancelled the order. We instead made to home depot the night before their sales ended to buy the same fridge. Fool Me Twice: I have now placed an online order with Lowe's for various sprinkler parts, yard treatment, etc. The order has been stuck as ""in process"" for 10 days.

I checked my credit card and even though the order has not gone through they still took it upon themselves to charge me THREE times for the order.

Lowe's Companies,BAIT AND SWITCH PRICING!,"I never leave negative reviews, however, I am tired of Lowes bait & switch practices (which is illegal). They advertise an item on their website on sale and when the item is added to your cart it becomes full price. This is the second time it's happened. Called Lowes Customer Service & the customer service agent tried to rectify the situation by offering a discount after I emailed a screenshot of the sale item online. When she called her supervisor, Richard Miller in Indiana, for approval he denied it stating a screen shot isn't sufficient. I spoke to another supervisor, Dom (ID # 1986346) who claimed the situation did not qualify for any discount and the price in the cart was correct, not the advertised sale price. He was also going to speak with the customer service rep for offering a discount of which she did not have the authority to do so. I told Dom the rep was trying to find a solution and not to chastise her. After I got off the phone, the item was still advertised on sale. Am going to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. Will NEVER purchase anything at Lowes and will keep supporting Home Depot!",0,1

Monday (3/23) I went to the store to find out why I hadn't heard anything. They said the order was not processed but will be taken care of. The person I dealt with was rude and acted like I was the problem. I received a E-Mail telling me that the mower would be delivered between 8am and 8pm Saturday (3/28). Please, that is ridicules. Was it coming Pony Express? Well right now it is 7pm (3/28) and I have not heard anything from anybody so I'am assuming I am getting jerked around again. This is the 2nd mower I have purchased from the same store. The 1st one had 0 issues and I was very pleased with the entire process. This go round has proved to be a total disaster. I know the world is going through trying times, but if you can,t produce an order let someone know.I believe I should be compensated in some form for the inconvenience and frustration. I am going to the store tomorrow ( Which I should not have to). If I am not satisfied with that result I am canceling the order and going to The Home Depot which is only about a 1 mile away. Maybe they know how to treat their customers.",0,1

I just had to pay $9.95 for a package of 9 small, off brand, rolls of toilet paper. I expected better of Lowes. As a necessity, some folks will have to go without something else, just to be able to have a basic such as toilet paper. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. You have lost a previously loyal customer.",0,1

He then says he will connect me with the fraud department because my card isn't correct. All he does is transfer me to another CS agent who tells me to log onto the account, which I told her I have been doing, she asked what web address I was at, I told her syncrony, to which she says, thats wrong, it should be lowes.com, she tells me to go to lowes.com, and then log in. I continue to tell her, that's what I am doing and that it takes me to syncrony, she says that's not supposed to happen, and she would transfer me but my husband isn't with me, and since he is the primary card holder, I need him. Today before he leaves for work, I call them again, explain EVERYTHING to them again (after listening to 5 mins of a recording telling me to log into my account rather than calling in), and the agent says; ""oh, tech support is down and we have no idea when it will be back up and running"".

Lowe's Companies,Bad Coved19 prevention practices,"I placed my order online with Lowes today so I would spend as little time in the store as possible and avoid catching Coved19. When I went in to pick up my order the cashiers were wearing masks and gloves along with plexi glass between customers and them,which I thought was a good idea. My order is picked and the cashier tells me I need to sign for it and proceeds to hand me a pen that has been handed to other customers and has not been sanitized. I tell her I will not sign with that pen that others have used. Keep in mind, she is wearing gloves and I'm not. She tells me that wipes are outside the door but then she goes and gets a Lysol disinfectant wipe and wipes the pen. Over all I am a fan of Lowes, but this time they really dropped the ball and are participants in spreading what is going around now by having people sign with pens that are not sanitized. There must be a better way to finalize the transaction.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,Can't trust Lowes!!,"November of 2018 we bought a very expensive set of Maytag washer and dryer from Lowes. We also included the high end warranty policy that was to cover anything and everything that could go wrong with it. Shortly after having it delivered in December of 2018 it started making a horrible noise, like it was a rocketship ready to take off. Long story short, main barring has gone out but Lowes will not honor the warranty because it doesn't cover noise. I will never shop at Lowes again!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Covid-19...,"If you are concerned about possible exposure to the Covid-19 virus Lowe's may not be in your corner. As an older (70's) do-it-yourself person (and rental property owner) I am concerned about possible Covid-19 exposure. Accordingly, I opted to take advantage of Lowe's ""in store pickup"" offering in which they gather the items listed on one's paid online order and hold for customer pick up. This, to me, appeared very attractive since I would simply run into Lowe's and pick up these already paid for items and back out in a fraction of the time it would take me to select each item and go through checkout. The logic seemed clear to me but it was not how things worked out. At the ""in store pickup"" desk, and with no one in front of me, the clerk was busy with the phone. Several times between phone times he picked up my paperwork and sat it down again. Finally, I asked how long I was going to have to wait. He then jotted something on a piece of paper and carried to to another employee who, without looking at it, placed it on the counter and continued a conversation. Becoming a little impatient, I again asked how long I was going to have to wait. He walked over and snatched the piece of paper without saying anything and disappeared for another 10-12 minutes. Finally I received my ""in store pickup"" after waiting some twenty-five minutes when there were no customers in front of me. Had I done my own shopping I could have completed this purchase in one-half the time with one-half the possible Covin-19 exposure. My senior status is obvious and still I was treated with disinterest and unconcern. And there were lines (blue) drawn on the floor with obvious reference to the Covin-19 threat. Go figure...",0,1

I went online and ordered the refrigerator I wanted got an email saying it would be delivered March 27, 2020, between 8am and 8pm. I cleaned out my refrigerator and freezer and waited. I decided to check to see if I could track and see approximate delivery time. When I did, I see that my order was cancelled. So, I called the customer service number to ask why my order was cancelled and after holding for 31 minutes I was told that there were none in inventory and it was back ordered. There was no email advising me of this and it is charged to my credit card. Thanks Lowe’s for a horrible experience. I cancelled the back order and will pay double not to buy from Lowe’s.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Glendale Lowes location in…,"Glendale Lowes location in Indianapolis, Indiana gave me the worst experience with customer service. The employee I dealt with today was Gina and she was so unwilling to listen or help with the mistake THEIR PAINT DEPARTMENT made 3 days prior. I received a gallon of just the base-NO COLOR-for what was to be a dark violet paint and the paint employee put the old paint lid I handed him the date of purchase to reference for color for the new gallon of paint. Because of this it did appear I bought this returning gallon in 2018. I explained to her this was the old lid he took for color reference and he put it on the new gallon. I even asked about it to the paint dept as I was picking the paint up and he said it was no issue to reuse the lid on new paint. He obviously was wrong. Nonetheless, this paint was still just a clear base!!!! Gina was the person in customer service I went to explain and resolve this issue with today. She did not listen to anything I said, did not look at the email receipt I was trying to show her of my recent paint purchase, and she grabbed the head cashier when I did not accept her ""there is nothing I can do because it says 2018 on here"". Gina, please remove yourself from customer service or try to reflect on what it means to provide a service and be a problem solver for a customer. All I wanted was help and understanding in this situation, and I was immediately met with defense and attitude. She appeared to be around my mother's age and my mom has never been that dismissive of me when I had a problem. And I know I was polite and not argumentative even in my frustration, so this entire interaction was unpleasant and confusing to me. I will definitely be avoiding this store in the future.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Stolen Credit Card - TWICE!,"I recently did two separate flooring projects thru Lowes, and I will NEVER do business with Lowes again! I have spent over $8,000 at the Lowes Riverview Florida location since the first of the year, which included two projects, each for several thousand. In both cases my credit card number was stolen, and this happened just 1 month apart. Just two days after using my card at Lowes, (and not used anywhere else) the card was used locally at a gas station. I went into Lowes and spoke to the manager “Harvey”, total waste of time, not very customer driven at all. I then called corporate; they were not any help either. So, if Lowes cannot and will not keep my personal information private and secure when I shop at their store, then I will not shop there and I hope others take my advice. Lowes, you can take your insufficient security, severely lacking customer service, and your Military discount and shove it! And if you have any brains, fire “Harvey” and promote Sy, he is one person there that truly cares about his customers!",0,1

The estimate for the repair is around $4200.00. Lowes said it was not their fault, and in fact it was my driving that created the lid to fall off. What?????

I was specific on NOT wanting an end of cycle signal. I called the store and asked the night salesman to switch my order to a lesser model that did not have the sound. He agreed and after much hassle it was accomplished. Waited 10 days for the dryer. When it arrived the door didn't close. The delivery drivers wouldn't take it back. They said Call the Store. Another dryer was ordered and the defective dryer sat at my house until the new one arrived. New one took even longer to be in and delivered. VERY INCONVENIENT!!!! When the new dryer arrived, the delivery driver/ helper, scuffed/ scratched my front porch paint hauling it off. The wood floor in my laundry area was also scratched pretty severely as they off loaded the new dryer, adding to the scratches made by the original delivery drivers. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!! So, in short took forever, careless delivery personel, scuffed/scratched porch and floor scratches for me to fix.

Still ignoring the Latino man, she stayed at her kiosk and told took customers who were walking up afterward. When she finally summoned us, we advised her that this man had been needing help for longer and should go first. So she sighed a deep, dramatic sigh and climbed out from behind her kiosk.

Lowe's Companies,Never ever will I use Lowe’s again,"Cape Coral Lowe’s Ordered a washer 5 weeks ago they came to install it The installer entered my house jumped on top of my dryer to disconnect old washer broke a pipe and flooded my laundry room he then went to get parts to repair broken pipe once he thought it was fixed he tired water on again and flooded laundry room a second time. He then called his friend to come and help him fix it Told me all was good and I was good to put a load in machine, well I did that and when I went back to get wash out the pipe had broken again and now the water was in my walls in the installation had gone under baseboards to my sons bedroom and soaked all the carpet. To make a very long story short I called Lowe’s who said it wasn’t there problem but the company the Lowe’s uses for installation xpo logistics I had to get a company in to remove baseboards half the wall in my garage Capet from my sons room and more Dry out was $1800 Estimate for repairs $6500 and her I am 5 weeks later waiting for an answer from someone on who is going to pay for this I wish I could post photos on this.

Lowe's Companies,3/15/20 8am worst customer service ever,"3/15/20 8am, 3 associates standing, 2 with clipboards. I asked for fake security cameras- response: not stocked. I asked for normal security cameras, told aisle 9. Not on that aisle. I return to front, another associate indicates aisle 7 or 8. Neither was correct. Again, I return to front and ask again for location to be told, 'I told you 3 times, we don't stock fake cameras'. Indifferent, insolent and unhelpful. Worst customer service ever.

Lowe's Companies,A true story of awful customer service 406688018,"My Order 406688018, Invoice 76329, is truly the worst case of customer service I've ever encountered; the issues and built up frustration I have with this purchase started off on the 25th when I had to call call Lowe's to make sure that the delivery address was correct; as this was being delivered to one of my rentals. Spent a good 20-minutes on the phone whereby I was assured that it would be delivered to the correct address. Then received a call the night before, and then the morning of, from the 3rd party delivery system indicating that it was going to the wrong address. Spent a solid hour trying to call back and have the address then changed in the 3rd party system, only then to get a call from the first of three drivers (as the delivery was made in 3-separate trucks) letting me know they were minutes away from the wrong address. But boy were those 3rd party Drivers both kind and receptive to my EXTREMELY annoyed self; particularity as the first delivery was the cabinets for which one had significant damage. Luckily, the driver pointed it out, though I immediately noticed it, and took a picture to make note. Was shocked though when I was presented with a ""pick ticket"" and no receipt, but told by the driver that I would have to contact Lowe's (Ugh, Again) to obtain a receipt. The second delivery was the appliances, and again no receipt. The third delivery was wood, for which the Driver was kind enough to fix the sideways directional, broken on his pallet truck to deliver the massive quantity of 16ft 2x 6x's to our front porch. Again, no receipt. So then starts my e-mail exchanges with Lowe's, as, working in Regulatory myself and regularly dealing with federal and state authorities on matters of policy breaches, I understand the importance of maintaining documentation for future action. The first 03.03.2020 E-mail from Lowe's Associate Ray W. whereby he presented the information necessary to submit the Samsung rebate and did the background information necessary (as I did up-front) to confirm that I actually qualified for this rebate (Kudos to you Ray). Next, an E-mail from Ty C. (customer care at Lowe's) indicating a 10% discount would be applied to my order as well as an “updated"" change order e-receipt; however, no rebates or discounts of any kind were ACTUALLY applied to my order: way to rub salt in the wounds here. Next, an e-mail from Samsung indicating that there are NO Samsung appliances associated with my Lowe's 406688018 order for which Ray W. (customer care associate at Lowe's) and myself confirmed. Then, an E-mail from Lowes indicating that it may or may not qualify (my Blood is boiling at this point); after ALL that I've been through. Further Lowe's Email communications assure me that the rebate that I do qualify for has been processed; but no formal documentation that the rebate is being processed but rather a threat that it could be taken away. Still sitting on empty promises from Lowe's for a 10% discount, several e-mails from Samsung indicating that there are NO Samsung appliances associated with my order and I DO NOT qualify for the rebate Lowe's communicated to me and advertised, multiple e-mails from Lowe's apologizing as there are CLEARLY three Samsung appliances associated with my $3,706.38 order as well as the fact that those appliances CLEARLY qualify for the rebate, a damaged cabinet, and a LOT of wasted time and headache.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,LOWE's Kobalt tool Guarantee is WORTHLESS!!! No Warranty at all!,"I have a Kobalt (my favored brand) 3/8"" ratchet set given to me at Christmas. The 3/8"" socket wrench was really cool and had a handle that operated the device in addition to the normal driver movement. It came apart at the head mechanism so I took it to Lowe's for a replacement or store credit. The device is not in production being a Christmas item from 2018 I guess. After 2 visits to separate Lowe's stores, 5 calls to Kobalt Customer Service, 2 discussions with the tool maker (CS?), and the last convo with a manager of returns, Kobalt Support, and CS all on the line at the same time - They could do nothing to honor their ""Lifetime - No Hassle - No Receipt - No Exceptions"" guarantee. Under a ""customer complaint"" category the store manager RELUCTANTLY offered me $5 for an expensive ratchet. I told the nice lady in customer service that that was an insult, didn't care about the ""limitation"" in the Lowe's system, and threw the parts in her trash can at 19210Preston Rd in Dallas, TX. Not a replacement ratchet (like Sears or others). That's it for me and Lowe's Tool Dept, maybe even Lowe's in general.

They called at 8:00 pm to setup an appointment in two more weeks and want to show up for that late afternoon as well.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes shady installation..twice,"Approximately six months ago I had a water softener installed by Lowe’s . They sent out a contractor, simply water, who ran the drain pipe along my basement floor into a floor drain. I questioned that and asked why they would not put it in the main drain and they said this would work fine once I got rotor rooter to come out and clean my drain. I did that. The water softener regenerated and flooded my basement. Simply water came back out again from Lowe’s and said “oh he should have connected it through this main drain pipe“ just like I had said the first time. He said he fixed it. I feel since Theo prob get a flat rate for installations, they did it halfway the first time because they didn’t want to deal with doing it the right way.Unfortunately, now if someone takes a back-to-back shower that drain he put in the main drain is overflowing into my storage room ruining everything in there. I called Lowe’s again and they refuse to do anything about it. They said originally I would’ve had to pay for that cutting into the drain. I explained that if I had known that I would have returned the softener or I would have paid it and avoided the flooded room and basement floor that I now have.. Lowes is refusing to do anything to make this right. Telling me they would need to $285. If I had never got this water softener this would have not happened. If the first installer Had installed it correctly, at the least I would had to pay extra but would not have a ruined basement floor, painted floor now looks awful, plus the cost of rotor router cleaning out the drain that was not necessary. This is the second installation at Lowes has done for me that has been shady. The first one they sent non-English speaking people over who then walked out and left my bathroom floor completely torn up with no explanation. I canceled my charge. I won’t go over there for anything. I’ll drive the extra miles to Menards. Rant over",0,1
Lowe's Companies,My Lowes expierence,"I have to say, I promised myself that I would never shop at Lowe's again. But I have to give credit when credit is due, I recently had to return a product back to Lowes for an exchange that was several years old. I went to the location in Homdel, NJ. I was lucky enough to have the assistant manager Matt help me with my issue. In the past when I went there, I would get promised the world and get nothing in return. I went on a Saturday as normal no one could help me, I was then introduced to Matt, who promised me he would call me back on Monday at 4pm. I can't tell you how many times I have been told that and to never hear from someone or even find them again. Matt called me back at 4pm on the button, resolved my issue and restored my faith in Lowes. Thank you Matt",1,5

Lowe's Companies,Bad Customer Service,"I went to Lowe's, in Hermitage TN, twice. I waited 10-15, while a rep assisted a male customer. While he was still with the customer, another rep asked to assist me. Told him that I wanted screening for my patio. He showed me rolls of screen and told me I had to figure out what I wanted. I showed him, a detailed text, of what I wanted. He just walked away. Went back the next day and spoke with another rep. Showed him the text and asked if they had anything comparable to what I had found online. Asked, also, if they had the framing. He said yes, but looked at me and informed me that I wasn't qualified to frame my patio. He was walking me to the rolls of screen and informed that I'd have to figure out what I needed. I expected better service, as in, suggestions, more detailed information on the different screens.

He then put me on hold and when he came back he explained that someone did not get the main page changed and that the new price is $4.98. He then told me if I called Customer Service they would honor the price since it was their error. Upon contacting Customer Service, I explained the situation and again was put on hold. This time when the lady came back she said the price is $4.98 and that they WOULD NOT HONOR the listed price of $3.00. She then asked how many I would like to purchase at the $4.98 price. I said I was shocked that they would not honor the published price of $3.00, and she said she was sorry but that the position of Lowe's was that they would not honor their mistaken published price.

The ball was now in my court to reschedule the installation.

I wrote a complaint to the headquarters in NC. Finally, they escalated the complaint to the District Office here in Atlanta, and they sent someone out to install it.

Lowe's Companies,Kitchen cabinets from Lowe’s,"Buying kitchen cabinets from Lowe’s we had the worst experience. Zero customer service. We bought over $8000 of KraftMaid kitchen cabinets from the Lowe’s in Savannah, GA. When the cabinets were delivered two of them were missing from the delivery. Of course, the delivery guys said, “Not my problem, that’s what was on the truck.” After literally hours on the phone with the delivery company and Lowe’s, the missing cabinets could not be located. We were told that KraftMaid would have to remake the cabinets. We thought since it was not our fault that the cabinets were missing and knowing that we had a contractor and a timeline to keep, that either KraftMaid or Lowe’s would step up to see that our missing cabinets were expedited. Nope! Calls to the local and national Lowe’s customer service either are not returned or when we do speak to someone, they have nothing to add and just say, “It’s in process.” After many weeks of delay the replacements finally arrived. We had to pick them up at the store and the only minimal compensation was a refund of the delivery fee. I am cutting up my Lowe’s credit card and I’ll never shop there again.UPDATEAfter posting here I finally received a call from the District Manager. He did listen to my concerns and was apologetic. We both agreed that this should have been handled better from the start. He also gave me an additional rebate to compensate for my problems with this order.

Lowe's Companies,Here we are 5 weeks and still waiting…,"Here we are 5 weeks and still waiting for our not yet 2 yr old front loading washer to be repaired under our 5 year extended warantee. Yes, 5 weeks. They were suppose to be here last week when A & E, (lowes subs all repairs to them, they are owned by Sears),called the day before and said that they were unable to make that apt. I asked them what time they would be here the next day and they told me to call another number and that I would have to make another apt. Well, that is suppose to be NEXT WEEK. This is not the first time this has happened to us. 4 years ago and a different machine, it took them so long that we purchased , sadly, another machine from Lowes. They finally called 6 1/2 weeks later to schedule our repair. Lowes will gladly take your money for the appliance, gladly take your money for the 5 year extended warantee, but then if u have a prblem and as the store manager told me...they have no power over A & E and how they do their scheduling. So Sad, and really really irritating the Lowes DOES NOT HONOR THEIR COMMITMENT OR CUSTOMER. When I finally did get to speak to the store manager, Alex, he asked why I wanted to speak to him because the other numerous people I had already spoke to had already given me the answer and there was nothing more he could do. Sarah, a lady I also spoke to suggested that they bring out a temporary replacement until mine was fixed. Let me see, that would entail removing our machine from the upstairs, bringing in another machine upstairs, unhooking and reconnecting the new one, THEN disconecting and taking it downstairs and bring our repaired machine back upstairs and reconnecting that one. I was tole that Lowes hires A&E and only pays them $90.00 for every visit and that there is only one repair man that covers Sanibel, Bonita springs, Naples and Marco Island. Is that considered service, is that taking care of their customer, is that right or is that PURE greed on the part of Lowes. Get the money and to hell with the customer. I would call this borderline fraudulent to mislead people into thinking that if there should be a problem it will be taken care of IN A TIMELY MANNER. So once again I am off to the laundry mat. Oh yea, one more thing, the entire area around the washer smells terrible because my king size sheet set is in there and is probably a moldy mess. I asked one of Lowes customer service people if they were going to replace my sheets seeing as they have basically been rottin in the machine for weeks and she assured me that they WOULD NOT. pLEASE CONSIDER THIS WHEN PURCHASING A MAJOR APPLIANCE, you might be much better of going to local appliance stores.

Lowe's Companies,"If you think Lowe's is really interested in you as a veteran, think again.","This week I was told at the register that my Lowe's card did not reflect a military connection. The same card has been accepted for a military discount for years. So, I presented my ID, but that was not adequate. (Understand what I'm saying. Even though there was some glitch and my Lowe's card was not accepted as military, I presented my military ID and that was not good enough. If you go to Home Depot and just present your ID, that's it. There are no special programs, no fanfare about how great we.) I proceeded to the customer service desk. Again, my phone number was not found in the system. I left my goods at the service desk saying that I would be back. I stepped away, called Lowe's corporate customer service and after more than 15 minutes on hold a very nice lady went through their records, verified my status and I returned to the customer service desk. I also asked corporate to remain on the phone and again, the store was unable to verify me. I went so far as to give the cell phone to the desk attendant and even then they could not coordinate this purchase. I left the store and will now happily do business with Home Depot without all the red tape of Lowe's. Many people would have been embarrassed by these exchanges in public, but for me, it's Lowe's that's embarrassed and has lost a good customer for life. Lowe's didn't embarrass me, they disgusted me. By way of full disclosure, Lowe's sent out email to those in this military discount program to verify users because, I assume, some users may have been fraudulent. I understand that.

Every time I call I get the telephone run around. Oh you need to call the install department . When I call them they say to call the team coordinator. I’ve called that number four times and had to leave a message. NEVER got a call back from Sheila the team coordinator. I finally got thru yesterday and the girl said I should be getting a Today. I never got that call. So I called them today and now they say they are still waiting on product. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes is a horrible experience,"Lowes is a horrible experience,after waiting at the register for half an hour and have them look up a price, they voided my order, because the cashier needed to go take a break, and I still didn't get help, they re-rang my order with a substitute person, and they I had to wait even longer for for the manager to come fix the price, the manager not only did not bother to math properly, they overcharged by a few dollars, at this point I just wanted out, and paid the extra few dollars and left. No place online to report this, so they get a bad review anywhere I can give it. Bad company!",0,1

What happened to the Loews that used to deliver next day!Hauls away is $30 for the old washer and dryer that we also bought there. No one at the store or company cares.

Lowe's Companies,Frustrated and Disappointed in Lowe's,"Frustrated beyond belief. I've got several complaints with the purchase of major appliances through Lowe's Home Improvement. First, we purchased four major appliances during a promotion offering a 10% rebate. The rebate was the ONLY reason we purchased additional appliances at this time. At the time of purchase, Lowe's provided us with the rebate information. After submitting the rebate, it was declined, and I'm now being told that they will not honor the rebate because it is not valid for Lowe's retailers. This is false advertising, and now my family is out over $550 dollars. In addition, Lowe's majorly screwed up the deliver of our appliances. We waited several weeks for two items that were backordered. Then, when all the appliances were in stock, Lowe's only scheduled two of the four appliances for delivery. We ended up having to go back to the store and pick-up the other two appliances ourselves. We have been purchasing from Lowe's for years for both our home and business, unfortunately we've lost faith in this ""big"" business who is obviously only out for the sale. Very dissappointing, Lowe's has lost our business.",0,1

Long story, short, I will receive one product Thursday and another in 7-10 business days.

Lowe's Companies,HORRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE,"Lowe's recently eliminated their own delivery department and went with a third party delivery service, probably thinking it would cut costs. Well it also cut customer satisfaction and will most likely end up cutting business as well. We recently bought a washer dryer set. First our delivery date was pushed 2 weeks, then in the days proceeding our new delivery date the time was changed 3 times...10 to 2, then 12 to 4, then 3:30 to 7:30. When you can the delivery company you sit on hold forever. When you call the store they can do nothing because it's an outside company that handles the delivery. Finally on the day if delivery we received yet another call at 9am saying they would be there in an hour! We were buying the washer dryer for our new home which was more than an hour away! The driver said the delivery times were not set until the day of delivery, which made no sense since we had already been called 3 times prior. A very disorganized service.

I have only had this dishwasher for about a year and it already has broken parts. I went back to the store to find a part to replace mine, and the same service worker treated me as if he did not have the time to answer my questions. He would not even give me the name of the part to research it myself.

This happened to me twice in the first 3 months of a no interest promotion for year. They were trying to charge me interest on the appliances I bought that were not supposed to have interest on them for 12 months. This place is a joke.

A manager said they could no longer honor that price even though I called Lowes customer service who said it was up the discretion of the local store.

Lowe's Companies,I ordered approximately 18 wall…,"I ordered approximately 18 wall plate/outlet covers and one bathroom vanity light in a single order online to be delivered to my home. I received notice several days later that my order had arrived at my local Lowe's and that I was to pick it up there. Unhappy that I had to drive there after asking for home delivery I went there only to find a portion of the order completed and that what was actually there didn't even match what their information says was there. I was to pick up 11 pieces and only 10 were actually there. I asked for a refund of the 11th piece and was told I couldn't get the refund that day and that I would have to come back tomorrow to get that. I then came home and called the contact number for online orders asking for a refund and they also refused to do so saying that the store had to do that and that I'd have to go back to the store to do that. Next... 2-3 days later the vanity light came in to my home. Amazing that it was shipped properly to me as requested. That's the one plus in all of this.Next... I get another notice that the rest of my order is in at my local Lowe's so I drive back over only to find that the order is incomplete yet again and that only 3 of the 7 pieces I was told was there were in the first envelop brought to me. Asking to be refunded for those and the item from my first drive over there I did, in fact, get the refund for that first item processed at that time. However, I was told that they could only cancel the remaining items left unfilled and that I wouldn't be charged. Apparently you're not charged for an online order until it is picked up. Or delivered, I guess. Frustrated that only 3 of the 7 pieces of my order that I was emailed had arrived ONLY had actually arrived I asked if there might be another package there for me with different pieces in it. Sure enough... in a totally separate package 2 more pieces were found. I left them there out of frustration as I was told I would have to now buy those again since they had already been cancelled. Odd that they could cancel the items that weren't in there in that trip but they couldn't cancel the one that wasn't in there the first trip saving me the hassle of having to come back to get refunded. Needless to say I did not purchase those just-cancelled pieces as this experience pretty much soured me on Lowe's. I ordered online in one order and asked to have it shipped to my home. In the end I had to make 2 trips to Lowe's to find that each time what I was told was there for me wasn't entirely there. If I had not cancelled it would have been a third trip to get the remainder of the online order that was to be shipped to my house in the first place. The time and frustration was unbelievable and rest assured I won't be doing any more business there.",0,1

I already had the hot water heater picked out with the item number but he still would not take care of it. After trying to find help with the hot water heater, I found one in stock and had to go back to the same man. He proceeded to help another customer while I waited over 30 minutes to find out if the washer and dryer was available. After an hour of rude service, I finally purchased the items.

I double-checked; no additional notification from Lowe's regarding the status of the order.I wrote Lowes.com twice. You can read their responses below.

I tried calling the local store to speak to their delivery department and the customer service department. No one ever answered.

I received a message an hour later from Lowes that the delivery guy was one hour and 10 minutes out from my house for delivery. They left appliances on my porch.

Lowe's Companies,Worst customer service EVER,"Worst customer service EVER. I recently purchased a GE washer for my mother and was told that it would be two weeks before it could be delivered. I wasn't thrilled but because they had just had a big home appliance sale, I figured that explained the long wait for delivery. Someone from Lowe's called me on my cell phone Monday afternoon to confirm delivery on Tuesday and to say that I would receive a call 30 minutes before they get there. My mother stayed home all day yesterday waiting for delivery. Finally, I called Lowe's at 5:00 p.m. and the customer service rep said that she was scheduled to be their last delivery of the day and they would be there between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m. No joke. When they hadn't shown up or called by 8:00 p.m. I called the store again...they assured me that the washer would be delivered and said that they had called and texted me several times with no response. The number that the delivery driver had was not my number! (the wrong number that Lowe's gave them) And the delivery truck never showed up. I called the store first thing this morning and they said the washer would be delivered today...couldn't/wouldn't give me a time, only that we're the LAST delivery today. Call me crazy, but I would think that since they screwed this up, we would be the first delivery today. I have talked to the delivery company and Lowe's and nothing but excuses and finger pointing. The delivery driver was supposed to have ""his boss"" call me back in 10 minutes....that was 2 hours ago. I sure hope they deliver today because I'll cancel and get a refund otherwise. I have done business with Lowe's for over 20 years, but this will likely be the end of the road for me. I see from the other reviews that I'm not the only one. Contracting out their delivery services may have saved them money with regard to employees, but it will cost them more than than in lost customers.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Angry with Lowe's,"A vanity was ordered from the website, and when the customer was told that it was going to be delivered, I was then informed that they only deliver curbside. The Lowe's website showed no indication that it would not be delivered to my door. I live on the fourth floor, in an elevator building. It would have been easy to use the elevator to get it upstairs. In New York, when a vanity was delivered it was carried to the third floor bathroom. Therefore, if Lowe's is a nationwide company, why is there such a discrepancy between one state and another. The problem with this is, should the vanity come damaged, there is no way of returning a damaged product. Lowe's needs to rethink which vendors they associate with, and their website should have been more forthcoming. It is now going to be a very long time before I go to Lowe's again, because I do not trust them. -MarilynSouth Florida",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Great for investing, Not a good place to work for","I am an employee for Lowes and before some of the new changes they made for scheduling, it wasn't a bad place to work for. You were able to schedule things ahead of time and have a life outside of work. NOT ANYMORE.Recently, they took away shift rotations so now you don't know what shift you're working and it's almost impossible to schedule any appointments more than three weeks out. In short, Working at Lowes=NO LIFE. The new Kronos system is a joke too. They tell the managers that they can't touch the schedules anymore, which is part of managing people, so employees get scheduled for 10 days in a row with varying shifts from 530am to 130pm starting times. Again, working at Lowes=NO LIFE.Frankly, the morale of the employees is next to nothing, and everyday feels like no one cares anymore, not even management. Change is good, but not when it negatively impacts the entire retail team. They might be happy on the corporate level, but they are completely blind to the fact that on the retail level, people are agitated and upset with these changes. In short, THEY JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE ANYMORE.",0,1

Well long story short we had them come and pick the refrigerator up and went later and got our money back then went to Home Depot they not only delivered the SAME refrigerator but it came in a box with styrofoam panels covering the sides and skin tight plastic covering both doors. I know now that Lowe's delivered a refurbished or returned item.I never saw it taken out of a box nor did it have the plastic that the one from Home Depot had on it which I'm still trying to get all off...there is no way they could have removed all that plastic from the time it took to get it from their truck into my house if I'm still struggling to get all of it off.They are shady and don't deliver quality merchandise, people work too hard for their money to try to be conned or ripped off.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Will Not Stand Behind the Products they Sell,"We purchased a Frigidaire refrigerator, 18 cu. Ft. capacity for $540.00 on September 21, 2019 from Lowes. They delivered it to our small retail store where it was to be used in our private kitchen that only employees may enter to store food items. We were remodeling and did not actually start using for food storage until January 2020. It worked fine until February 7, 2020 when it stopped working and the food in it ruined. It would not get cold.I called Frigidaire and the customer service person looked everything up and said it was covered under the warranty and she scheduled a repair person to come out. The repair person contacted me prior to coming and said he could not come into a business location. I called Frigidaire and the customer service person, Marcus, said the warranty was void because the refrigerator is in a business location. I explained that it was only in a small kitchen and had less use than if it was at my residence. He was very unhelpful and said it didn’t matter. All they would do is schedule a repair person to come out and I would have to pay them to come out and I would have to pay for any repairs. Although Lowes knew the refrigerator was going to a business location and they delivered it to the business location, no one ever mentioned that this could void the warranty. An independent repair person I hired determined that the compressor is bad and so it would cost more to fix it than the refrigerator is worth. I have purchased Frigidaire’s in the past but I will not again. They do not stand behind their products. Since I bought the refrigerator from Lowes I contacted them and they said they sell these for residential use only and the warranty doesn't apply if it is at a business. I pointed out that Lowes knew where it was going and they delivered it to the business location and never once told us this would void the warranty. We did not have a copy of the warranty until after the refrigerator was delivered. Lowes did not respond. They don't care. They want to sell you a product but they will not help if the product is defective.",0,1

It took a week to get the refrigerator. It arrived very damaged. Another one was ordered, again I waited another week, and that refrigerator was also very damaged. Each time Lowes tries to convince me that it is ok and they will drop the price for me. (I actually felt like they are just trying to pawn off their damaged goods to me for a minimal price drop.) The damage is very significant on both refrigerators, and I have no idea how it will affect the longevity of either refrigerator. I spend an incredible amount of time on the phone with very rude Lowe's employees. One employee hung up on me twice, and when I called back a 3rd time he said, ""Don't cop an attitude with me."" I was simply trying to correct the problem of damaged goods. I lost a total of 16 hours of work so far and had to pay 16 hours of daycare for both of my dogs. I have large dogs and need them out of the house during this type of delivery. This was my first experience with Lowes, and it most likely will be my last.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Bad service, wrong product shipped, refused return label","Bike called a Lowe's store and asked if they had unscented hand sanitizer and they said yes. I drove 30 miles to the store and when I got there they said oh we don't have it we just sold the last one. I don't think they really had it.So I went online and bought unscented hand sanitizer which cost me $10. When it got here it wasn't unscented it was the regular scented hand sanitizer. After trying to call the number and closed and being on hold forever, it was making funny noises I don't think the number work, I just went to Google on my smart phone and said call lowes.com. I did get through there to that numberWell they won't let me return it I have to drive it all the way back 30 miles to the store I originally drove to and called previously. Nobody is even willing to send me a return slip. Now why in the world would I go to that store in order something I already knew the store didn't have? When you go to lowes.com I guess you're not really at.com, you're ordering locally. That didn't make any sense to me. I'd be crazy to order from the store who didn't have the product in the first place and now who refuses to take my return. Never again.

We ordered a Gas dryer on Dec 13, 2019. The local store did not stock a conversion kit to convert the dryer for use with our propane. The local troops search every store but none had the kit. They told us that it might be 30 days to get a kit. They could not give us an estimate of the delivery until the kit(s) arrived at the distribution center. The delivery was put off by me because the dryer is of no use without the kit. Finally ther dryer was delivered.. Jan 20, 2020. It didi not work. Called the warranty number, took over a week for a service person to appear on the scene. He left saying he had to get a part, never saw him again. On Feb 3 the local Lowe's called to tell me that the were exchanging the dryer. It arrived Feb 3, 2020. Converted it and it is up and runnigThe kit retails at Lowes for $14.95. Probably cost Lowes less than $7.00. The MBA's don't want the local stores to put one on the shelf , making a customer wait over a mointh ..",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I wish I would have come to the reviews…,"I wish I would have come to the reviews before placing an order!So I ordered a washer and dryer for over $1600. The Loews rep said that if I opened a credit card with Loews, I would get $300 off of the purchase (special incentive). I opened the card and placed the order, and received only $75 off of the order. 2nd rep said first rep made a mistake. Ok - moving on, I asked when delivery would be and they told me that Lowes' delivery service would be in touch. On a Thursday night at 6 pm (while I was on the train and could not receive the call) I received a voicemail message saying that the washer and dryer would be delivered the next morning. Needless to say, I did not have enough time to request the next day off, so I spent 3 hours - that's right - 3 hours on hold waiting for their deliver service to pick up the phone to reschedule. At the same time, I called Lowes stores and got a CSR that said that she could change the delivery date to the one that I requested. Oh happy day! She also said that for $103 I could have the whole shebang installed. I told her to put it on the new card. She said that it was declined, despite the fact that I had a $4k credit limit. I put the installation fee on my AMEX intending to call the bank that held the Lowes card. Well I didn't have to because they called me 5 minutes later saying that there had been fraudulent charges on the card and that the card was now frozen. Come to find out that Lowes had put two holds for $1,600 on the account and then tried to charge a $3 difference which was declined. They said to call Lowes and straighten it out. I called Loews again who said that they did straighten it out. I believed them. The day before the delivery I get a call from Lowes NJ (the Lowes where the machines are supposed to be coming from) saying that they cannot deliver on the day scheduled as they only deliver on Fridays. In addition, the charge for installation in NY would be $350 - not $103 which was already charged. Canceled the order - canceled the credit card. Ordered the same set from COSTCO. Same price - delivered as promised - COSTCO delivery service amazing. I not writing this to punish Lowes - I'll just never buy from them again.

Store didn't bother to inform us and we couldn't get a hold of anyone (try calling the stores - no one ever picks up!) and many angry emails, calls all over, escalations, etc a store manager had the attitude of 'these things happen and we can't do much if Kraftmaid doesn't do a good job'.

We went to that particular department and the associate (with an attitude I must say) told us that it was not on sale there and he couldn't do anything about matching the price from another store. The item was clearly in the clearance area with other items and was not marked. We got the head cashier and assistant manager involved and they took care of us and gave us the discount. We were almost to the point of never shopping in Lowes again. The 2 of them restored our faith in customer service. Thank you Patricia and Cass.",0,5
Lowe's Companies,Really?!?!,"Really?!?!? Bought a washer -dryer from a MANGER. Was told it would be delivered in nine days (TODAY ) and someone would call on delivery day with a 20-30 minute window. Rearranged our day like a couple of pretzels back and forth all day —even roping in outside help to cover gaps—waiting for THE CALL. Never happened. Called Lowe’s at the end of the day to find out why no one called. Spoke with store manger, Pia, who looked it up in the computer. Apparently they never had the machine they sold us. Computer revealed the Lowe’s staff identified the problem A WEEK AGO and asked management how to deal with it. CRICKETS!!! So they never reached out; they just waited for us to call in with a problem. NICE....So now we MAY get our machines in ANOTHER 5-7 business days (now14-16 days later). Got them to give us $50 off the replacement but would prefer to have received our stuff today. Lowe’s implied we should feel lucky. Really?!??!Update: Finally, they delivered and installed our machines. The dryer didn’t seem to be heating. The installers assured us electric dryer were slow getting started initially —and they BOLTED —before we could establish it did work. You guessed it, the dryer never worked. We called and they explained the Lowe’s stores HAD NO CREDIT anymore per corporate, so they could not reorder our machines until after they picked up the DEFECTIVE one. They got it and said someone would call with an update in a day or two. CRICKETS. A week later I called them —and eventually got the right person after being transferred around (oh that’s delivery, let me transfer you, click) and cut off five times.

Lowe's Companies,I recently moved to PA from NY and…,"I recently moved to PA from NY and previously had a good (not great) experience with Lowe's when I remodeled my kitchen and two bathrooms. I decided to buy 6 appliances from Lowe's during Black Friday. I have never experienced such poor service in my life. Let's start with the refrigerator. Lowe's uses a delivery service called XPO who is supposed to call the day before delivery. They never did. Waited until next day and spent 40 minutes on hold. After I gave up trying to reach them. Finally called the store and they could not find a delivery even though the item was in the store! Finally came 3 days late. Next item a washer/dryer. Again 2 days late and when delivery came it was 2 DRYERS! They had no clue why. They took 1 dryer back. Next day delivery calls to say they have my washer but it's the wrong one and it's damaged. Do I want to still accept it. Seriously? Ordered a sink. Lowe's came in to measure for installation. After they came to measure I went back to Lowe's in five days to order the sink. When looking up the order they could not find. Why? Because Lowe's entered my last name incorrectly. Dishwasher I I had no issues with. I ordered an electric range and was given a delivery date. Days before no one called with a delivery date. Went to the store to find out what occurred only to be told the items was back ordered. Again no communication. Lowe's is supposed to check on back orders and let customer know. Range was supposed to arrive 1/2/20. I am now told I would not receive until March 2020! This also included a microwave. I was so frustrated I cancelled and bought right in store. Of course it was not the one I wanted however I was desperate. I finally sent an E-mail to the President of Lowe's who passed me over to his assistant. She did offer an upgrade on the range however it still ended up costing me an additional $800.00. Calling either their customer service or the Mount Pocono, PA store you are just passed from one person to another. No one seems to care about their jobs. If that is the case then don't work there. Simple as that. I knew in my gut I should have gone with Home Depot. I will never make that mistake again. Shop at Lowe's on your own peril. Corporate decided to send two people directly from Lowe's to install the range. They came and asked me for MY TOOLS to install because they had none. Then they could not flush the range against the wall and told me I needed an electrician? Upon taking way my old range they dropped it and the glass shattered in my driveway. After they left I pulled the stove out and moved a box to the right. Guess what? I was able to flush it perfectly against the wall. This would be sad if not so comical.",0,1

Cashier doesn’t say anything just walks down to the lock box. I literally watch her pull out a new nest then pull out another old one, put the new one back and she walks back and gives it to me. No plastic, box is beat, I looked right at her and said really? She’s says “ Sir not every nest we get has plastic on it”. Now I’m getting hot, I open the box and the screen is literally scratched up. I said this is a $250 dollar thermostat so you either you go get the new nest I just watched you pull out that lock box or refund my money. The guy in returns starts the refund. I watch her go back down take the new nest out and she just walked the other way. Lowe’s what is up with this employee. I like Lowe’s and still do!

The last installer called in measurements for a new door and indeed verified it had to be replaced. Not sure why the first installer's notes were not good enough but the 2 installers agreeing would do the trick, right? Well I called in 2 weeks later (knowing it would take at least 3 wks for the new door to come in) asking for an update. There was NO notes to be found ANYWHERE that my door needed to be replaced. It was like they were either ignoring these installers or just not going to replace it. They were trying to get a third (#3) installer out to take a look at the door to see if it needed replaced. I asked why they didnt believe the first 2...nothing in their records of it. I started to record conversations and keeping track of all who I talked to and mentioned I was going to have to get a lawyer involved and VOILA! I spoke with Lana who said she found the notes and measurements of my new door (just like magic) and that my case has been escalated to URGENT and that the door will be ordered. WoW! They somehow found the notes and measurements of my door right after I mentioned a lawyer. I spoke to about 5 people who said there was nothing they could do but have a third installer out to check, I then asked...""well what is going to happen when you lose their notes and measurement?""...Paul at the store said it has always happened that way, there is poor communication and there was nothing he could do to help me. Anyways, Lana ""found"" them. I will keep you updated on if it actually ever does get installed. I am giving them a month on this since it will take at least 3 weeks to get my new door in.",0,1

REALLY ! 2nd attempt for dining room wrong size again. Did I mention that the paint on the wall was chipped a good half inch long. Newly painted home. Hence the reason for new blinds. Finally on 3rd attempt blind in dining room fit. It was rigged to fit not a new blind.. Clip to pull this blind down missing. Needs to be delivered separately. Would give 0 stars if possible. I paid close to $2000 for this product and service. Never again will I purchase anything from Lowe's Home Improvement store.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Can't use my warranty or extended warranty because everything is ultimately ignored.,"Bought a Frigidaire fridge. Seems to me that they sold me a used floor model as there was already unusual marks on the door, and the doors did not close evenly. They said they'll put the claim in under my ""extended warranty"" even though the unit was recently purchased. They did send a guy out, but I have never been able to get followup. They answer emails, but just request all the same information all over again, and eventually stop responding. I wasted $ for the fridge, wasted more $ on the extended warranty.

Lowe's Companies,No loyalty,"I've been using Lowe's for over 12 years, I practically get something from Lowe's every weekend! Today, I want to purchase a microwave and a dishwasher. The gentleman helping me was very pleasant and very patient, because for 1, I have a one-year old with me and 2 I'm pregnant with twins moving very slowly. After deciding which items I want, we try to use my grandfather's veterans discount. Only to find out, they no longer accept the veterns discount on sale itemed appliances (confused). No worries though, because I have a Lowe's credit card that I have used for over 12 years and will receive a 5% discount. I also have an in store credit card that has $100 ok it, that my 87 year old grandmother gave in return for cash. Only to find out, that they do not accept those unless the person is present with their license number. Well, my grandmother lives in FLa, not to mention, doesn't travel. So, the manager, Mason steps up, and says that I will have to go to another store to use the card?? ""I'm sorry, what?"" You want me to go all the way to another store, to use my grandmother's license number? Very frustrated, I go up to the customer service counter to chat with a Supervisor. We waited for 30 mins before I decided to call the Lowe's complaint line. After speaking to the call center representative about ways we can work this out, I mention ""FaceTime"". He said that might work and tries to get the supervisor up there yet again. I explained to him, that not only have we been waiting on a supervisor for 30 mins, I've now been on the phone with him for another 15 mins (reminder, I have a 1 year old who needs a nap, running around the store. After being out on hold for a little over 5 mins, I decided it was best for me to leave and get my daughter down for her nap. At the end of the day, loyalty means nothing to Lowe's. And it's very unfortunate, because they could have made my day wayyyyy better than it was. I am now considering, cancelling my credit card of 12 years and NEVER going back to them again. It's really sad.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Service Dissatisfaction,"I bought a gas stove from Lowes and purchase their extended warranty. Within a year the stove would not hold it's temperature while baking.Lowes warranty Dept. scheduled their repairman to service our stove and he never showed up nor did he leave a message. Subsequently we called Lowes Warranty Dept. filed complaint for ""no show"" and rescheduled the service appointment. The Lowes customer rep. made an attempt to reach the contracted technician but was unable to do so and left him a message of customer dissatisfaction. Again, no repairman showed up and no phone messages were left for the second appointment. Called the service Dept. a second time to report the no show. Customer Service said the repair service claimed to call us and left a message that he ordered the stove part and will be installing it next week. Find this hard to believe since the repairman never showed up to do a diagnostic and never left a phone message. At this point we asked for a different repair service and was told they only have one company that does repairs in our area. I find that extremely hard to believe since we live in a heavy industrialized area with many highly qualified certified technicians. They would not attempt to find anyone else to help us and told us to find our own repairman to service the stove and turn in the repair work on their claim form for review. I will never shop at Lowes again because their Warranty Dept. does not seem help customers with solving.their service contractor contract problems and the company itself does not want to honor their service contracts to the customer satisfaction.",0,1

When I called Lowe's warranty number I was told basically I'm out of luck. I believe if the problem started during the warranty period and the fact that either the stove is a lemon or the repairmen are not competent they should make good on the warranty that I paid for.

Lowe's Companies,"Lowes supports abusive, dishonest, torture-pig abusers","Lowes is aware of the circumstances described in the following narrative, and their Milford CT, manager, Tim, promised me a complimentary new hot water heater and installation to compensate for the damages I sustained as a result of their contractor's prolonged abuse, stalking, and vandalism. However, a week after I was promised resolution, the hot water heater has not been delivered or installed. Clearly they are in the business of breaking promises, harassing customers, and perpetrating retaliatory vandalism. I have filed a complaint with the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection for breach of contract, fraud, civil rights violations, purposeful vandalism, and harassment.There is nothing about me, or my circumstances, that gives sadistic, fascists, the right to abuse me. My basement was flooded by a retaliatory cyberstalker after I destroyed the I-phone he had cell-site-simulator hacked, bugged, and tampered into oblivion. This cyberstalker was probably associated with corrupt law enforcement. I called Ezra, who installed, and serviced the last hot water heater, that was most likely destroyed by the same vandals. Ezra showed up, told me that Lowes hardware store would pay for the hot water heater, but not for the installation, and proceeded to pump the water out of my basement, and re-direct it back into the same basement via the garden situated above the basement. Incidentally, I told them not to do this because this was how the basement was initially flooded. Nonetheless, Ezra, and his associate, proceeded to re-flood my basement for over a week. After a week's worth of broken promises, they finally installed what appeared to be my old dried out hot water heater, apparently keeping the new one Lowes provided for themselves. They also placed the sump pump hose or pipe directly above the basement again, thus flooding it again, and rendering the repourposed hot water heater inoperable. Not only did this cause great inconveniences, it also jeapordized my life, and health. Formerly submerged hot water heaters are fire hazzards. I have been without water for two weeks, and was treated with name calling, false accusations, lies, and extreemely hostile abuse by Ezra when I called to ask him to remedy the situation. Lowes even offered to pay Ezra to bring out a new hot water heater and install it, but he was not interested. Clearly he needs me to suffer. This sadistic man also managed to get my mother's phone number, called her, lied to her about me, and demanded money for unneeded work that I had not hired him to do! He also gaslighted me, made inapropriate insinuations, and broke promise after promise. He ruinied my holiday season, and nearly drove me insane. He and his associates are cowardly sadistic, abusers, filled with micro-aggressions, and sneaky, mean cruelties. Ezra behaves like an oportunistic, stalking, woman hating psychopath. No doubt encouraged, and possibly paid to abuse by the fascists who vandalized my property in the first place. Ezra hasn't the decency, or graciousness to help in times of tragedy unless he believes there is opportunity for exploitation. Good people don't violate, or abuse, because they can't bear to cause others senseless pain. Bad people create opportunities to abuse because they enjoy the pain of others. Ezra is a bad person. He will openly, and brazenly defy you, thus creating disastrous consequenceses. Steer clear of him, if you value your health, finances, and sanity. The fact that Lowes paid Ezra, after hearing my complaint, indicates complicity, and approval of EZ service, and maintainence's corrupt, abusive, business practices.",0,1

I will follow up and let you know how bad Lowe's can get.Again, the baseline store specialist failed to call me on Monday 01/06/20 like he promised. Today is 01/08/20, i am calling the baseline store again, lets see what happens.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,We purchased a smloker/barbque ($500)…,We purchased a smloker/barbque ($500) on December 12 in the Elk Grove store. They assured it would be delivered to our son for a Christmas present by Christmas. It wasn't delivered. I called and they said no one assembled the grill so it couldn't be delivered. No one called us to tell us what happened. I had to call them. They scheduled another delivery date. The morning of that day I got a call from the delivery person who said he was not willing to deliver the grill because it was scratched and its paint was chipped. At least it was assembled. They scheduled another delivery day with assurance that it would be in great shape. I called two days before the delivery date. The grill was not assembled and they didn't know when it would be. I spoke with someone who said he was an assistant manager. He assured me he would personally make sure the grill was assembled and delivered on the promised date. Today is the delivery day. My son got a call form them saying the grill was not assembled and the soonest they could get it to him would be in three days. I called the store and they assured me it would be assembled overnight and delivered tomorrow. We'll see. In my 65 years this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Lowes should be ashamed. I plan on meeting the store manager tomorrow.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Stolen Savings,"We bought a washer and dryer set during a black Friday sale and were told the items would be delivered in 10-14 days. After 2 weeks, we received confirmation that our items had arrived and would be delivered in 2 days. The following day, we were told our dryer was out of stock and they had no clue when it would be in stock again. We were told to select another dryer, and we selected a downgraded model from what we had already purchased. We were then asked to pay $70 difference because the current price of the cheaper model was more than what we originally paid. I explained that we had saved more than 30% by purchasing our washer and dryer on Black Friday and that we expected to maintain those same savings. After speaking to multiple different employees and managers via customer service and a local store, we were told that the original 30% savings could not be matched because it was no longer Black Friday and because the dryer was a different model. The best they stated they could do was match the price we had already paid for the more expensive model. We purposely waited for Black Friday to make these purchases and saved a lot of money by doing so. This was taken away from us by being forced to wait for a model that would never show up and then taking away the sale discount we had earned. We are appalled at being forced to pay the same price for a cheaper model dryer that does not have as many features as the original model. It is not right to take away savings that we had originally received and would have continued to receive if Lowes had just delivered the product that was guaranteed to us. We will never again return to Lowes and will continue to tell friends and family about the horrendous service we received.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I ordered shower doors from the Lowe's…,"I ordered shower doors from the Lowe's in Howell. They arrived broken twice which is not the stores fault. However the night manager had no idea how to refund my money and I had to return to the store the next day. In addition, I purchased a mattress and when I tried to exchange it for a larger size (ie. Spending more money on the purchase) the manager stated because the matress was purchased at the store in Tom's River, he couldn't honor the sale price at the Howell store because it would make the store LOOK like it took a loss. Here's the kicker--the matress was still on sale but was ringing up wrong in their system. As were other items which I noticed in the 30 minutes I waited. I will shop at home Depot exclusively from now on",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Although I have had a few good…,"Although I have had a few good installers (door installations) with Lowes, the numerous bad experiences with Lowes outweigh them. This one ended my shopping there ever again. Back in November of 2015 I bought three appliances. A washer and dryer (Cabrio) and a dishwasher. Because I was warned that these machines are very expensive to repair I plunked down the money for the extended care. Was told that if I didn't use it it had a $50 rebate. When the extended warranty expired in 2018 I called (with NO service calls) and was told my machines didn't qualify, sorry. Okay. I did not take another policy. This week (14 months after the policy expired) we discovered that when their installers came they reversed the water input. I had no idea as I had never done a ""cold only"" wash. But the red dress enlightened me when it ruined everything in the wash with it and shrunk. My husband used a mirror and told me that they had reversed the water input, so the call for cold only gave me extremely hot water. I called the store (Derby, CT). I was referred to a customer care specialist who told me to either call the installers or the extended care company. I tried to explain that those people worked for Lowes and not for me and Lowes should do whatever calling was necessary to correct their error. Nope, I wound up calling extended care, who was very nice and placed a call back to the store for me; Patrick got back on the line and told me ""no worries"" Peter in the Derby store would take care of me. Peter hemmed and hawed but after I objected to all his ""company policy"" and ""you've had the machines for 5 years"" I could tell I was getting nowhere. I told him it wasn't a machine problem it was a people problem and that even if my warranties had expired (btw not five years ago but 14 mo. ago and again there was no machine issue anyway) they should stand behind their work. Okay, I'll send them over to fix the error, that will be $68.00. I lost it. Why should I give them an additional $68 for their mistake and sloppy work? ""Well, we've changed our installers."" Okay, so your installers are not on retainer and will not help you secure the respect of a customer that has bought hundred of dollars worth of equipment and service? ""No, they get paid every time we send them out."" When I asked if my husband might be able to reverse the tubes he explained it was only a 10 minute job, easy to do . Yep...10 minutes and easy. Too bad he lost a customer forever on such a simple fix. You installers are making a lot of money picking up all Lowe's intalls, they should understand your very occasional need for a free fix, it's part of any good deal. Goodbye Lowes, I'll remember this next year when I replace my stove.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Do not stand behind products or value their customers,"I have been a loyal customer of Lowes for many years and have not had any serious issues until the last purchase of an appliance that I made. I bought a GE dishwasher that was not properly installed and therefore the door would not close properly. Three appointments and wasted days waiting for repair personnel, and its still not fixed. I have spent hours on hold being run around between Lowes and GE because as much as they preach about standing behind their products, it's a different story when it comes time to actually do it. Nothing but finger pointing and deflecting responsibility from both organizations, and people wonder why these large companies are not trusted.",0,1

She called over to the original girl to check me out. I went back over to where she was and she walked away without saying a word. So, I left my cart there and walked out.

This was not an option for us. The most frustrating part about all of this is every time we are at this store there is never anyone there who seems to know how to help. This is why we opted to purchase the said exterior doors directly through Pella, when we went to Lowe's to inquire about them, no one could help us or give us any information. We even paid to have someone quote us on installation and had to call several times to get that scheduled. Very friendly employees, but overall horrible customer service.",0,1

A week went by with nothing and the store kept telling me they had no knowledge of this so I contacted corporate again. I finally got a tracking number and once the item arrived it was not even close to what I ordered. For 2 weeks I argued with corporate trying to figure out what was going on and if I could still get my original item purchased and kept getting pushed to the store to speak to the ASMs who would hang up every time. Finally after 2 weeks I finally got told that they never pulled my item and sold out within the week I placed the order. I was informed that another individual with the same last name called and that was the item they wanted. After being told there was nothing they could do I was told just take the wrong item back to get reimbursed. I had to argue with the local lowes with corporate on the phone at the same time because they would not accept them item since it was purchased out of state. I was finally able to get reimbursed for the item and warranty but they refused to refund the shipping saying even though the store shipped the wrong item. They still shipped it so I was forced to eat the charge. When I was saying it was not fair for them to take my money for the store not shipping me the correct item corporate basically placed the blame on me for placing an order and that they had no intention of making the situation right.

When Lowes bought a great hardware store (Orchard Supply) and then shut it down a year later, I was done. How is Lowes still in business?

Come to find out the dryer doesn't turn on. At all. I set it up just right doesn't work. It took 2 weeks to have a technician come in. So that's already 4 weeks after purchase not getting to use it. They had to order ports and it took even longer. Another week passes. They come in and it still doesn't turn. He tells me I need to have the dryer replaced because the mortor doesn't work. I call the higher ups and ask about the extended warranty since I didn't purchase it yet and I got an email about it from Lowes. They told me, I shouldn't buy an extended warranty until they send a new dryer. So I call up Lowe's about sending me a dryer and they said yes we'll call you in 2 hours to set up delivery. they never did. So I called them and not a soul knew what I was talking about. No one knew how to help. I was literally, no joke, on the phone for 45 minutes. Being transferred the entire time. I was transferred to appliances twice and customer service 3 times until I told them someone needs to help me. They just gave me a number to call DSI. I fall DSI. DSi was quick and easy. They told me they scheduled it to be delivered and I'd get a call the day before. I never got a call. I call the day after since I worked before we set up another schedule for today. Here we are again, no call. So, I bought a pointless dryer that doesn't turn on and Lowe's hasn't done a damn thing about it, but waste my time.bi haven't been able to dry my clothes for a damn month. I'm guessing I'm totally screwed and have to pay the same amount I paid for the dryer to have the mortor replaced my self, because Lowe's sucks. Higher ups and my local store both screwed me.

Ordered cabinets for a kitchen which were delivered damaged, not even the same layout design and features were not added. this being a rental we could not wait to reorder. Their cabinet installer was a great guy and we figured a layout that would work. Not the layout we wanted but a layout that worked. Their counter top guy was a nightmare to work with and very degrading calling names and telling us to go back to where we came from. NO One is ever held accountable at Lowes.

Lowe's Companies,Poor Online Shopping Experience,"This is the first time I have purchased something from Lowes Online and I am disappointed in some missing features. When I click on order status all I can see is ""In Process."" But, no tracking number or further information. When searching for a place to buy this product from, Lowe's came up with the quickest option for ""pickup tomorrow."" However after adding the item to the cart it said in store pickup would take 5-7 days. So I selected to have it shipped for 1-3 business days. However, now your website indicates there is 1 available today for pickup.Part of my frustration is that my buying decisions have been skewed by what information is being provided but the information is not consistent nor inner connected. Is there really a unit available at my location? When can I expect to receive my order? It said 1-3 business days, so does that mean it will be delivered today or am I going to have to wait over the weekend? Has it even shipped yet? I don't really know. I know sometimes you buy and item online and it says 3 day shipping but it isn't even shipped for 5-10 until after the purchase. I am sure Christmas doesn't help and this is likely a chaotic time of the year. But not having a tracking number or other means of knowing the status of the order is what begins the frustrations.Hopefully this feedback is beneficial in implementing future changes. If Lowe's wants to compete online with the big players there are several issues that need to be remedied. I will definitely take these issues into consideration next time before I choose to purchase on Lowe's online.",0,1

Well Lowe’s would not accept the return unless she returned everything she purchased. I’ve never heard of such a thing from a store! Not accepting their own unopened store brand with the receipt presented. I’ll be forced to sell this thing at a bargain because the other items she purchased that day have been opened and used.

I already started with drilling holes for the pulls so I’m screwed not the cabinets. Every Lowes employee I ask for help keep ending up with I should call the manufacturer and see if they can sell me the screws.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes wants our money but refuses to talk when we have problems.,I am a military retiree and have become frustrated at Lowe’s for their lax policies concerning personal information. The policy is to ask for a military ID when giving your phone number so the military member or their family gets the discount. Lowe’s in Fayetteville allowed an individual who will not be named to call in and add their information to my account and obtain my mylowes cards in order to get my discount. I complained to the store numerous times and called into the customer complaint line. Each time I called I was told that a member of management would call me back and no one ever did. I’ve called over 15 times and begged for a management team member to call and discuss how this could be resolved and no one has. Basically Lowe’s allowed unauthorized people to change my account and refuse to do anything about it. It’s a disgrace that this is the way they treat military members.

After sitting on hold, I decided to go to my local store to talk to someone in person and we arrived 2 minutes before closing but they shooed us away.

Lowe's Companies,Worst. Purchasing. Experience. EVER.,"Please read the following review in a ""I'm so confused I can't help but laugh"" tone of voice. No anger here — just extreme levels of bemusement.We placed a $1,000 washer/dryer order over the phone and our card was charge six times. It was refunded, but let's just say that this was a portent, an omen, a sign of the tomfoolery to come...We then spent a total of AT LEAST FOUR HOURS on various phone calls trying to correct the issue (we were mostly kept on hold; please find more variation in holding music; please for the love of god, add more variation in holding music!!). Lowe's claimed that our bank was at fault for why our card wasn't going through properly; we called our bank, but they had nothing to do with why we had been charged SIX TIMES for our washer/dryer. We had to call Lowe's back, where were put on hold many times and just had to sit there, waiting, while Lowe's continually ran our card. AND THEN THEY HAD TO CALL US AGAIN THE NEXT DAY (and immediately put us on a long hold) BECAUSE ONCE MORE THEY COULDN'T GET THE CARD TO WORK??? AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY CALLED BACK AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS STILL NOT WORKING????? We were told their system must be down, that our card must be bad, all manner of things to excuse why this was happening. The card was working everywhere else, and we have no idea why they had so much trouble processing overcharging and then not charging it. We asked to use a different card or pay in cash but apparently they would have had to cancel our order and we'd lose our Black Friday sale pricing if we tried to alter our order details, which makes very little since, but this company seems to make very little sense in general, soooo...But wait, it gets worse. Eventually they just gave up and told us we would have to go into a physical store to make the purchase since they were having no luck over the phone. ""Any store works,"" they told us... but when we went to the most convenient Lowe's in our area, we were told that we had to go to the EXACT STORE that our washer/dryer would be shipped from. The store in question was 45 minutes out of our way, adding 1.5 hours of driving time to this experience. (*picture me falling to my knees and screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO"" at the sky, please and thank you*)And when we got there, it took an hour for them to get the card to go through. They swiped it dozens of times... and eventually it just went through?? Randomly?? The staff had ZERO CLUE why it had finally gone through out of the blue, nor why it had not gone through so many times before; the solution was entirely random, it seems, which isn’t great for a thriving business model. We were then instructed to KEEP CALLING BACK the next day to make sure the payment had actually processed, which resulted in more wasted time on our end.Eventually the payment worked, though, and our washer and dryer were delivered...... aaaaand one of the brackets on the side of the dryer was bent.But NO WAY am I returning the item, because dealing with Lowe's again is *absolutely out of the question.* Is this a strategy of theirs to unload faulty appliances on customers without fear of having to recollect the item? If so, their tactic works, and I applaud them for their Dr. Evil levels of super villainy. Long story short: I have never had to work so hard to pay someone $1,000. I personally would love to be given $1,000. But to each their own.All I know is that I will never be shopping at Lowe's again. Being charged that many times (and then essentially having to devote an eight-hour workday to correcting their errors) is egregious, no matter how funny-in-retrospect the ordeal is. NOTE: The people at the store(s) we visited were very nice and were absolutely flummoxed (perhaps even more flummoxed than we were) by the whole ordeal. Some of the phone agents were less than helpful since they gave us the wrong info about which store to visit, etc., but everyone at the store(s) we visited was perfectly pleasant, even if they weren't able to speak with authority on why we were having issues. So there's no blame I'll place on them at all, and please know that they heard our woes and worries with civility and kindness.To be completely honest, it's been long enough that I find the whole situation funny. It's a comedy of errors so extreme, I went to work each day and had to give play-by-play updates to my fascinated coworkers. I'm past the point of being angry/annoyed, and while I'll never shop at Lowe's on purpose again, at least I got a great story about appliances out of it. I am sure to be a hit at parties forever more with this tale under my belt.EDIT: I tried to submit this review to Lowe's proper website, and an error message that read the following popped up: ""Something went wrong on our end. Please try again later.""If that doesn’t perfectly encapsulate what it was like trying to deal with Lowe’s, I don’t know what does.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Lowes Store#:  1609  Traverse City, MI","Do not shop here if you want qualified, professional sales personnel. I have three homes and spend a lot of money at Lowes especially this year in order to sell one of my homes and this is how I was treated:I was lied to in order to make a sale. I was promised two $200 rebates and only one per family. I wasn't allowed Black Friday prices because I was going to have it installed. I had two more days to go before so I could have the floor in prior to Christmas Promo and my sales person made me do it the day before Thanksgiving.He did not have the correct address of my home or delivery address correct; he didn't combine quotes to give me a discount; he didn't offer a VA discount of 10%. He double dipped me on padding for the floor and when I asked to have it removed he just removed the padding and not the installation. With all the above discounts and removal of items it comes to over $5,000 I was overcharged so when I complained in my survey the sales person began to retaliate against me. He threatened me that I would not have the installation prior to Christmas. He won! He was having my flooring shipped to Indiana instead of Benzie County and when he corrected the address they were going to give me less than 24 hours to get to that address when I live four hours away. Needless to say I called the Store Manager and told him to cancel my order and return my $12,500 to my credit card, he did. He never asked for the reason and just said OK.I went to Home Depot and used my sales persons figures. I only needed 65 boxes of flooring there whereas I needed 99 at Lowes. Home Depot gave me a $12 discount on the number of boxes I would need and also a VA discount.I WILL NEVER SHOP AT LOWES AGAIN!They have lost my business as they protect their sales personnel rather than the customer.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I purchased a lg dishwasher for $800.00…,I purchased a lg dishwasher for $800.00 at the lowes store in Clermont fl at the cagens crossing location. The unit makes all your dishes smell like you washed them in a fish pond. The store is giving me a run around about replacing it. I told them I would have it removed and they could refund my money and I would get one somewhere else. They are still not doing anything.i have only used it twice and messed up two sets of dishes. This has to be the worst store ever avoid doing business with this lowes store.l,0,1

Lowe's Companies,* * * * *  AWESOME LOWE'S CUSTOMER…,"* * * * * AWESOME LOWE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!My husband and I have been a longtime Lowe's customer, recently the need arose for another lawn tractor purchase. We purchased our 3rd John Deere Lawn Tractor from Lowe's of Hanover, PA. This one for our daughter and son-in-law who is currently deployed overseas. The 54"" cut tractor was used twice at their home when an oil leak was discovered. Approximately 3-1/2 hours of mowing on the lawn tractor.... We hadn't even received the bill for the lawn tractor... My husband called Lowe's to advise and they asked that he bring the lawn tractor back for them to inspect. Upon their inspection it could not be determined where the oil leak was coming from so they immediately without hesitation refunded the lawn tractor and sold him another. We would like to thank ANNA and JUSTIN at the Eisenhower Drive store in HANOVER, PA. for making this return effortless. It is reassuring to know that Lowe's takes care of their valued customers in today's retail market. Thank you Lowe's. D & B (Hanover, PA.)",0,5
Lowe's Companies,I ordered a range on line on Friday,"I ordered a range on line on Friday, 12/6/2019. I called the store to see what would be available for delivery on Saturday. I was told no problem, there are 76 in stock and you will have delivery over the weekend. I received a confirmation that my delivery would take place on Sunday, 12/8 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Sunday I had heard nothing so I called @ 10:00 a.m. to be told that I wasn't scheduled for that day but for Monday, 12/9. I have a email guaranteeing the Sunday delivery. After being on the phone for over an hour I was told that they are sorry, they will deliver the next morning - I would be the first deliver but 8:00-noon for eta. I was told that a Manager would be calling me regarding an appeasement. I had to take the day off without pay. Monday, no one showed up in the time frame. I called, again on the phone for over a hour to be told we don't have anything indicating first delivery and we are sorry but the driver broke down. He will call you and advise as to eta. Didn't receive a call from the driver. Called and spoke with Brad- pro-delivery Manager who didn't care at all. Finally, I received a call from the driver and received my range at 3:45 p.m. The crew (Ray and Johnny) were courteous and very apologetic. They said their paperwork had us for a 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. delivery. They also didn't have a copy of the paperwork for me. I initiated every phone call. I expect to be reimbursed for my lost wages. I will NEVER order from Lowes again. I can see why they are closing stores. HORRIBLE!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,BEWARE BEWARE!!,"BEWARE BEWARE!!! READ ALL THE REVIEWS!!! WORST COMPANY IN THE WORLD! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! AWFUL COMPANY!!!! I ordered an item from Lowes.com. After 2 months of shopping around, I found the product I wanted, cheaper that anybody else on the entire internet. I contacted the customer service to verify the product was correct prior to ordering. They verified it was. A week later it showed up. It was the WRONG ITEM! I called the first CSR. They couldn't understand I didn't receive the correct item. Then I got the second CSR. They explained that this item couldn't be returned. It was the wrong item. And basically I was told that I'm stuck with it. For 1 ENTIRE HOUR, I requested a supervisor. And was denied access to one. For a complete hour. Next the 3rd CSR.... Agreed to price match the item. But after 52 minutes on hold, said that the management would agree to price match ... the wrong item that was sent, that couldn't be returned! The explained I had to drive 1.2 hours to return the item to a lowes store. By now I contacted the manufacturer of the item. This is when I found out that the item lowes was selling, has NEVER EXISTED! The company that makes the product, HAS NEVER MADE THE ITEM BEING ADVERTISED! 3 escalated reports later.. still no word from the higher ups! What an AWFUL COMPANY! NEVER ORDER FROM LOWES. EVER.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Ordered a refrigerator and range,"Ordered a refrigerator and range. Had to be ordered from the mainland approximately 6 to 8 weeks, but if it comes in early we will get it delivered early. Appliances came in December 8th but was told still could not be delivered before the 30th because that was the tentative delivery date because of the wait time coming from the mainland. I asked the manager who said sorry but we are all booked up. In my opinion if lowes we really concerned about there customers there stores would either bring in more help for the holidays or subcontract out to qualified people like they do for there flooring and kitchens installations. Even after contacting there customer service department it was the same story. All they really care about is getting your money and after that to bad. I'll bet if you didn't get charged for the items till you received them, that they wouldn't be sitting in there warehouse for three to four weeks before they got delivered.",0,1

Since I placed the order on November 23, 2019, I thought a two-week delivery was fine. On Friday, December 6, 2019, I received an email for Lowes saying that “Your Delivery Is Scheduled for December 7, between 8:00 am and 08:00 pm” So early on Saturday, December 7th I unplugged my old Stove and got it ready for pickup by 8:00 am. I waited until 5:00 pm and when I called to confirm that we were going to receive the new stove on that day, the operator asks me where did I Place my order, I told her online and she immediately transfer the call to her Manager (“Erik”) he told me he was the manager of the Lowes store near me and that the truck was still delivering, I asked to confirmed if my order was on the truck and he asked me for my information and told me that it was not. I then asked why? He told me that the online website does not confirm that they have the item when they send me the email and that he did not have that model in stock. I asked when will I get my stove and he told me when General Electric sends us more inventory and that could take up three months, he suggested for me to cancel the order and go to the store to get something they had in stock.I canceled the order and went to Lowe’s and bought the only stove that fit my needs and I had to pay more than 100 dollars more for a stove with fewer features than the one I wanted.Please think twice before you use the Lowe’s Website, they don’t have a clue of what they have in their inventory, How to treat customers, or how the delivery process should work.I pledge I will never use the Lowe’s website ever again!",0,1

The owner continued to make excuses after excuses. I never shop at Lowes and will not for ANY future services. I think you all need to check the background of who is handling your deliveries and who they are hiring. I guess we got lucky at 1:00a because the owner said someone cancel which bumped me up so i guess I wouldn't have gotten my deliverer until maybe 3:00a what a joke. I am going to file a formal complaint as well. My husband and i received a riding lawnmower as a gift. They dropped it off on the lawn and that was it. I asked i they were going to help my husband move it at that time of the morning. Only one name Devon, help the other when i asked simply ignored me and got back in the deliver rental truck.

Not one employee in the vicinity. Store was not crowded with holiday shoppers on a rainy Saturday. Flooring guy was on lunch. They should put an ""out to lunch"" sign on desk for that hour. Made my selection and waited over 30 minutes. Went down several aisles to find an employee. Asked him to call manager over. Waited another 10 minutes and picked up desk phone and called operator. Asked to talk to have manager come to flooring. Frank arrived and I explained it was not a great experience for a customer in physical pain. He was very nice and helped me with all the tile choices, even helped with the math calculations. Inventory was not where it was supposed to be so he had to call someone else in to find it. He offered to mark down some of the tile sheets that had damage. He loaded up my heavy cart and got me to check out. He also loaded my vehicle. If it had not been for Frank today, I would have left.

We would have a new one in 2 days. And the store would call us the next day. They never called, so I called at 6 pm and customer service said that it wouldnt be delivered for 7 full days after they took our old stove.... What?! I called the store and asked the manager to call us. When he did he said it would be 2 days earlier. So now 5 days instead of 7... We will see if it actually comes.

One of the toilets was not properly anchored via the tubing causing major water damage in my laundry room ceiling. Water was seeping out filling the light fixture with water, and also damaging the fire detector. I panicked and called a plumber for help. My plumber came and assessed the incident. Low and behold, the hose from the toilet to the pipe was not secured. My plumber put on a new tubing and the water thankfully stopped. Although this was a weekend, and Thanksgiving was that week, I have received no immediate assistance from Lowes about my situatiion. It took Lowes 4 days to assign me a claim number. I was told an Adjustor would come to my home. It is now 12-03-19 and I have not received confirmation that someone will come to my home. To add salt to the wound, I never received a courtesy call from Lowes asking me how my installation went, nor did the Contractor go over anything with me after installation. That is truly unprofessional! The Contractor AND Lowes who did the work should be liable for the water damage in my home and step-up and repair what has been done to my home.

So my brother went back to Lowe's to tell them we're not having the concrete delivered, so we are wanting a refund. Well we went round and round with the store manager, Stephanie Morris. She would not return our phone calls. Then my brother went inside the store and spoke to the other store manager, Brian Grismore. Stephanie was there. She told both of us that my brother had signed a ticket that said we picked up the concrete. Really? Concrete weighing over 14,000 pounds??? When my brother asked her for the date and time of the pickup, she refused to give it to him. I can tell you that no one picked up that concrete, nor was it delivered to my house. Like I said, we used a different company for the concrete. Both managers refuse to give me a refund for something i never received. I told them to check their surveillance videos. That's not going to happen. Brian Grismore and Stephanie Morris are dishonest crooks. They are not problem solvers, nor are they professional. I am going to close my Lowe's account, and my mother and brother are going to close theirs too. I am going to tell as many people as possible not to do business with Lowe's. Go to Home Depot. Go anywhere, except for Lowe's. Please share the hell out of this.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,"MONTOURSVILLE, PA STORE","So I needed to pick out tile for my contractor one night around 7PM at the Montoursville, Pa. store. That was when I had the pleasure of meeting Ike Drammissi.He was busy loading up a flat cart. I figured he was loading up an order.I knew he was busy - but I didn't know what type of tile I needed for my shower install.He immediately gave me ideas and I began to look around. I again interrupted him with more questions.In the mean time he was interrupted by an irritated customer who couldn't finish his bathroom because he had been waiting for 3 weeks for bull nose tile.Ike handled the situation great!At the end, it turned out the tile I wanted was on the top shelf. Soooo Ike had to drag the ladder out. Not once did he make me feel like a bother.I believe IKE is an asset to your business.",0,5
Lowe's Companies,Please save your sanity and shop elsewhere.,"We finally had a great experience with a knowledgeable employee.We purchased 4 appliances at a good price and paid extra for a extended warranty.Then the problems started. They scheduled and missed multiple install dates and we were repeatedly told the dishwasher was coming the next date, it did not show. We called many folks, were repeatedly transferred to someone else. Finally someone told us our dishwasher was on the dock and we had it installed weeks after it was to be here. When they finally arrived the installers did not speak English and did not know what they were doing. Installation was done on different dates by different folks who missed many appointments.Then the stove top fractured while cooking, we called and were told it might be our fault but they would look at it. They have now made and cancelled another 2 appointments. Who knows when they will get here. Then we were promised a $249 refund credit card in 2 weeks. It has now been 3 months, no credit card, no service for the stove. We have made over a dozen calls trying to get our appliances, trying to get our rebate and trying to get the stove serviced. We can no longer recommend this store and it's terrible reviews and folks passing the buck are well earned.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,my bad Lowes experience,"my bad Lowes experience. I bought some products from Lowes in July 2019 and had it delivered. My cost was 280.00. All seemed fine until this month Nov. 2019. The same charge should up on my credit card statement and I had not made an purchases of this since July.I called my bank and reported the problem. I then called Lowes corporate. They said they had never been paid for the Items I bought in July. I had to send them a copy of my July bank statement showing that they had been paid. They called me back and it was because I had two deliveries because I must had double clicked on the order. I told them I only had one delivery and they needed to check it out further because I had not signed for more than the one delivery. My bank has taken it over and I have not heard back from Lowes. I had the bank close that account so they could not keep using my credit card without my consent.. SO DON""T let them get you credit card number...If you do business with them watch your bank statement because they don't mind using you account without talking to you..",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Beware of Door purchase and install,Door purchase and install - From the first day installed door had mold that was not flush & and scratched but thought this was cosmetic. The door sounds like Velcro is ripping Everytime you open it (we thought this was because it was new but it's been 5 months and still sounds that way. The seal between the door doesn't keep small insects out when they climb on door. Lowes sent the installer back out then the Manufacturer rep. Who squirted caulk? In week holes but the insects came from where sliders meet you can't caulk that but he said we could pull the mylar strip off and the door won't. Be as noisy I asked if that would allow bigger bugs in and he said it could. The lady in the claims was very nice but never really had a solution after 5 months offered a Lowes gift card for $100 we declined and are still looking for a resolution. WE HAVE USED LOWES FOR 15 YEARS BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY GUARANTEEED THEIR SERVICES but probably going to change to Home Depot,0,1

Lowe's Companies,Horrible customer service,"This is regarding a GE Profile refrigerator under warranty. Lowe’s sent a GE tech out specifically because they said they were very sry I was going through all this for so long and getting shuffled around and wanted to assure me the best people would address my fridge not keeping temp especially the freezer with temp in the mid 20’s most of the time. When the tech arrived he called Lowe’s Advantage to confirm make an model to perform warrty work which was confirmed. He said “no worries I can replace every part on this fridge”. After 30 min he said I cannot fig out the problem I’m calling our tech support they hv the most knowledge. He had the man on spk explaining that it would not keep temp the fridge or freezer and what he checked so far. The tech man said, “ how many years of experience do you have? I have many years and this fridge has sludge in the system it cannot be fixed”. I asked for a better explanation and was told nothing st all, he said I never heard of sludge in a system and he soon left.Two days later I called Lowe’s expecting a replacement which I had already been told would happen this was a formality to see if was repairable and was told”the work order from GE says it has a bad compressor an cannot be repaired”. I was shocked an then was told that although they see all my other purchases for every single appliance in my home they cannot see this one, even though they sent a man out in a warrty job approved and verified again at my home tge day of the work that I witnessed. Three months now it’s not working I’ve called numerous times, went to the store four times as the holidays approach I cannot rely on my refrigerator. I’ve lost meats as well as other foods and cannot put new food in freezer! It makes me wonder how much money are we talking about after I’ve paid for a fridge the warranty how much profit they’ve maid verse the cost to replace and honor their WORD !!!I have purchased every single appliance which are on file, I remodeled my home as well as all the outside landscaping tools machines etc all from Lowe’s and they will not spend the COST OF A REFRIGERATOR TO HONOR THEIR WORD AND STICK BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.I think it’s disgraceful what they’re putting me through. I’m 60 an disabled, it’s hard to keep going to the store and telling my story to another person or even worse on the phone because you always reach another person who swears they can help and does nothing but disappoint. I purchased most of my appliances from a gentleman named Paul who unfortunately he passed away some time ago, he was like a friend I spoke with him every time I would go in the store. Another Mgr named Duece always nice an ready to help and then there’s Johnny wheels who everyone knows who greets you and can direct you to anything you want in the store. And then the store manager Dan is actually a very nice guy, I’ve shopped there for many years he’s always been nice knows me by name for years. He said he would try an help but I have not heard back from him yet. All friendly people who have been nice to do business with. It’s the Lowe’s Advantage Dept that’s running me around like a fool, all of a sudden after they said they would replace my refrigerator, sent out a GE tech to verify it’s not repairable now they cannot find the original purchase. NO ADVANTAGE HERE JUST AGGRAVATION FOR YEARS OF LOYALTY!!I challenge Lowe’s Corp anyone who possibly cares to help me. I found a fridge for less than what I originally spent on sale to replace my lemon. I’ll answer if you care enough to call.6094427989Ty",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Very disappointed in this company,"Very disappointed in this company. I went to Lowes in Santa Fe and bought a white dishwasher and told them I would be by in a few days to pick it up. When I returned a few days later, I took my receipt to Customer Service and they said they would pull the item and bring it up front. I waited 1 hour and after a hour the lady in Customer Service said the do not have a white one. She told me to go back and find a different one. When I went back to the appliance department. I picked out 3 dishwashers and the salesman (Tim) looked online to see if they had the white ones in stock. He said they did and said he would go back and make sure they were there. All three white dishwashers were not there although their inventory showed they were. After two hours of waiting, I told Tim to go back there and find me a white one and I would take it. After 30 minutes he returned with a white dishwasher. This one was the cheapest one they had and I was not pleased to purchase it but I did because of the big hole in my kitchen. My advise to anyone who needs appliances is go to Home Depot. Lowes inventory is really messed up when the computer shows they have them and when you go to pick it up, there is not one. Somebody at Lowes is taking appliances from the back room and selling them and Lowes is not aware of this. If you do purchase appliances, make sure they have exactly what you like before you spend hundreds of dollars on it. Make sure they have it in stock even if the computer inventory says they have it. I had to give them one star in order to write this review but if I had my choice, I would not give them one star.",0,1

I would not recommend Lowe's for any large project you may have. I've attempted with other projects at different Lowe's stores in the area with the same results. Lowe's should stick to small hardware like tools, lawn equipment, etc. stay away from large projects at least until they get their act together.

I told them that I contracted the installation with Lowe’s and that it was their responsibility to get the job done. I was told that I would be contacted the next day by the corporate office to review/reschedule the installation, hopefully with a more reliable contractor.I never heard back from Lowe’s but rather received messages from handy asking me to rate the job.

Lowe's Companies,I’ve honestly NEVER been as disgusted…,"I’ve honestly NEVER been as disgusted with any purchase and subsequent experience as I have been with this purchase at Lowe’s. I cannot even begin to express just how insufferable every aspect of the entire 37 DAY process has truly been. This may sound melodramatic as it was only the purchase of a dishwasher with instillation; however, Lowe’s and all related agencies involved in the process made this simple transaction an absolute nightmare. From the instore customer service, to installation scheduling, to installation customer service, to the promises of alleged compensation, it was all the worst I have ever experienced in my life. DUE TO THIS EXPERIENCE, WE WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER PURCHASE AT LOWE’S EVER AGAIN. Long story short... #1- We were lied to and misled into using Lowe’s installation at the time of placing our order. Before we even could buy our dishwasher, we waited almost 30 minutes in the store only to find out that we would have to come back again later because the associate we had been waiting on wasn’t even in the store at the time. Second, we were told that our dishwasher instillation would be free after a rebate, only to find out after much effort that the associate was wrong and we would be stuck with the charge. Third, we were assured that the process would be fast, and would not take longer than a week after we had made it very clear we needed the new dishwasher ASAP and were more than willing to handle the delivery and install on our own. Fourth, the associate assured us that the steep gravel driveway to our house on a mountain would not be an issue for the delivery. He even made a point of telling us several times that he had noted the need for the delivery truck to be 4 wheel drive. This last part ended up being the primary reason for the repeated cancelations, despite offering to help transport it to our house ourselves. #2- Instillation with Lowe’s involves an extremely convoluted system! Lowe’s uses an outside agency, Install LLC in our case, to schedule subcontracted install techs from various other smaller companies to do the installations. You are told that the agency will contact you to schedule the install as soon as they are notified by Lowe’s that your appliance is in. We didn’t get our automated call about the proposed install date until almost 2 weeks after placing our order. Better yet, the call informed us that the proposed date wasn’t for another 2 full weeks, a total of 27 days after buying the dishwasher. They also inform you that you will receive a call with the details about the install the day before the scheduled install date. We NEVER received one of these calls for any of our FOUR scheduled dates, we had to reach out to Lowe’s installation customer service who then reached out to Install LLC, who then reached out to the subcontractors.#3- All FOUR of our installation appointments were canceled last minute, like after 6:00 pm. To add insult to injury, we were only ever made aware of these cancelations after being the ones to initiate contact. For each of these scheduled dates and times, my husband and I had to make significant sacrifices at work to accommodate the install techs’ schedules. #4- Run around with customer service. We spent hours on the phone with various reps from all of the various departments involved. When we expressed our desire to cancel everything and go elsewhere, we were assured that our valid concerns were heard, that they would make things right, and that we would be appropriately compensated for our considerable inconvenience due to all of their mistakes. While we were still trying to find out who would be coming to our house and when on day 37 after our purchase and not reaching anyone, I was finally contacted by a representative from the NAL Group at 11:30 am. The rep was extremely rude, and poorly informed regarding the full extent to which we had been inconvenienced throughout the process. She initially offered only $200 which barely covered the cost of instillation which we had previously been told would be FREE and had been the whole reason we still didn’t have a dishwasher over a month after buying one. When I got emotional due to my disbelief, the rep’s communication became even more indecorous. In fact she cut me off to nap that she would follow up on the install scheduled for that day, would call me back, and HUNG UP ON ME! I tried calling her back throughout the day and NEVER heard back from her. It’s 9:00 pm now, so I think it’s safe to say she isn’t calling back.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowe’s needs a class in customer service,Went into Lowe’s in Waynesboro VA before work this morning. There were more employees in there than shoppers.

Not one single employee acknowledged that I was even in the store. I passed some several times. No one asked if I needed any help. I’m going to Home Depot this evening after work.

She had 3 people helping her apply some sort of paint discount. After five minutes, I gave up, dropped my pending purchase on a nearby shelf and left.

Lowe's Companies,Could not get purchased dish washer installed.I,"I purchased a Bosch dishwasher from Lowe’s on Peachtree Pkwy on 10/25/19. I was told the installer would be in touch with me in a couple of days. I waited about four days and called Lowe’s and they said they would get back with me shortly. I did receive a call later in the day and they scheduled me for an installation. When the installer was to come he called and said he did not have the junction box that was needed to install and said I would need to pay an additional $120.00 plus the junction box. I told him to take the washer back to Lowe’s. I went to the store and thought I had settled the issue with the Salesperson and a manager. I was told there would not be any additional charge and an installer would call me probable that afternoon. I waited another four days without a call. I called Lowe’s on 11/8 and asked for my salesperson and was told she would not be in until after 1:00 pm. The lady at Customer Service looked at my order and said they had deliver date of 11/30. I was NOT informed of this change. After all of this confusion, I went down to Lowe’ and got a refund. They did not seem to care if I bought from them or someone else. I came home and ordered my Bosch 500 from another store on line and they installed on 11/14. It was a stress free purchase and I will NEVER use Lowe’s again. By the way, I purchased my dishwasher from Best Buy!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Purchased a Samsung 22.5 cu.ft,"Purchased a Samsung 22.5 cu.ft. refrig and a Bosh dish/wash on 8/29/19. Told the sales person we were having our kitchen re-modeled and would need them in about 6 weeks. We also purchased a storm door. We waited a long time it seemed for the storm door. Come to find out they were using an old land-line phone number of ours that was disconnected 12 yrs ago. Hence, the reason they couldn't get a hold of us. We were told that the only people who could correct our personal info was lowes corporate office. Contacted them and gave current info. On 11/08/19 I contacted lowes to have our appliances delivered 11/14/19. The person in charge of scheduling the delivery said he had the dish-washer but not the frig. He suggested I come in the store and address the issue. I waited 40 min to talk to the appliance supervisor. He looked at my paper work, got on his computer for what seemed like an hour, only to tell me that lowes had been trying to contact me(you guessed it) at that disconnected phone number. So I ask how is it that they have my dishwasher which was purchased at the same time, but not the frig? Crickets! I then ask, when can we get a frig delivered? Possibly 11 Dec closer to Christmas he says. I suggest he look at other stores in the surrounding area. DUH! He says oh I found one and we can deliver it on 11/14/19. Great!!!!!!! I've been living out of a cooler for weeks, can't wait for that new frig. 11/14/19 delivery truck shows up. They bring the dishwasher inside. Then the driver says ""Sir, you might want to see this"". I go outside and there on their truck tailgate sits my brand new dented refrigerator. They take a picture of it as did I, put the box back around it and wave bye,bye. I call the store and share my wonderful experience. No one seems concerned. The supervisor again says they can have one around Christmas. I figure those are my options. However, I go to Best Buy and they have the same frig, so I ask if they can meet lowes price? YES they can! How soon can you get one to my home? Monday the 18th of NOV! I am in Heaven. I go to the lowes store this morning and speak with Chris, the store Mgr. I tell him my story and ask for a refund. He gives me my refund, we shake hands and I depart the store. Once at home I look at the receipts and notice there is a $192.57 discrepancy. I call corporate office and explain the entire story. The person puts me on hold and calls the store. Talks to Chris and then tells me that there was an error and that it will take 14 days for my refund to actually go back on my card. I will not buy a screw, washer, or anything from lowes again.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's continues to make the same mistake over and over again!,"Lowe's continues to make the same mistake over and over again And that is the definition of insanity; which is exactly how my husband and I are feeling right now. It all began last week when we moved into our new apartment. We purchased paint from Lowe's in Pico Rivera, CA for our living room. We did not have enough with just one can so we went back for another. We took with us the lid of the paint can which had the paint name, code, and the actual paint on it. The gentleman we flagged down was busy speaking to a female coworker and it was obvious the conversation was not work related. He told us to give him 5 mins and he would have it prepared. My husband and I continued with our shopping, returned to pick up our paint and headed home. We finished painting that night and made touch ups on the walls we had finished before. The next morning was a nightmare; our walls were all patchy! He had given us a semi-gloss finish opposed to the flat that the original paint was! All that work, all that time, gone. My husband and I took days off of work to get our home situated and turned out we got nothing done. My husband returned to Lowe's explained to the manager that we needed two cans refunded due to the touch ups we had made and now have to redo it all and He said ""well didn't you check the paint before using it?"" The gloss finish is not noticeable until it dries and we provided multiple ways for the employee to give us the right paint! How was the manager trying to blame us? Where is the accountability? We ended up getting a new can this time we took the correct paint can in its entirety not just the lid to alleviate any mistakes, but that did not help. We painted one wall and realized it was the wrong color it did not match the other gray we had once dried. I cried so much due to frustration, I feel defeated. Again, time, money, vacation days taken from work all lost! How is it possible that they keep getting the paint wrong when they have it right in front of them to match it or actually use the code on the lid? It's insane! I can no longer take days off from work and what was suppose to be a weekend project has now consumed us for an entire week. We have yet to complete our living room. We cannot move in our belongings since none of the painting is complete. I seriously do not understand! This is the worst painting experience of my life. My husband and I are owed money, time, and labor for the multiple trips, the multiple times we had to paint and still aren't done, and the multiple days off we had to take. Someone needs to be held accountable.",0,1

They told me that they contacted the exact store and it was set to be delivered 11/8/19 between 2-6pm.I then received a call on 11/8/19 at 8 am also ensuring the washer would be delivered between 2-6pm.I waited around for 5 hours on Friday 11/8/19 and NO WASHER SHOWED UP.Then I call the main customer service line and they said that not only was my washer not delivered, they don't even have it in stock yet. Please explain how this is remotely possible. How I was emailed, called, and checked myself, and no one knew that not only was the washer not going to be delivered, you didn't even have it in stock?! How can you say something will be delivered that is not in stock? Any why 2 weeks after I ordered it is it still not in stock?I demanded a full refund and was ensured that I would be followed up with and that the FULL amount would be put back on my card within ten days. I also begged to talk to someone higher up, because this is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of, and she told me that someone would follow up with me instead. No one even offered me any kind of compensation to try to keep me as a customer. My family and friends will no longer use Lowes, and of course I never will either.

Lowe's Companies,Super Happy with 2 Lowe’s Stores,"The 2 Lowe’s that I experienced lately have both come through with brilliant colors. First - at a competitive store in the Memphis TN area, I had the worst experience with a clothes washer ordeal. The salesman was great. Delivery was confirmed by email and was to be on a Saturday. When no washer showed up, I checked online - no info / was instructed to call 800 #. They had no info about why it wasn’t delivered. Called store many times letting it ring for very lengthy times with No Answer. The store was open. Tried salesman at his extension and general Appliance dept phone many times with no answer. The few times someone did answer general number, ringing a department was fruitless. How DO they stay in business???I had a stack of laundry to do that had to be done that weekend due to work schedule. Ended up learning that my delivery spot had been moved to 4 days ahead but no one communicated that. Was forced to cancel that order. NOW Lowe’s On Winchester Rd in Memphis TN - I ordered the washer over the phone with Jessica in sales, and it was delivered the next day - on a Sunday. Delivery was well-communicated, on time, efficient & courteous. While working in Jackson TN the next week, I went in to Lowe’s on Vann Dr. Bought new clothes dryer from Roland / great salesman. Delivery was well-communicated and on time. Jimmy Fish, delivery coordinator was great. Delivery guys Shane & Bo drove 1.5 hours to my house. They called because a detour caused them to be 5 min later than projected. So nice & professional. Lowe’s is my new go-to. Both stores were primo in sales, product selection, communication, delivery & set-up. I couldn’t be happier.",0,5

The panel bucked up and down multiple times dipping both up and down thru the sawing process. I'm surprised the saw blade did not explode.The ending pieces are 4 unequal tapered and uneven pieces varying up to 2-1/2 inches in width both over and under.

Don't personally use the product so I can't help you ( customer)"" I just got here.""""we don't have it"" ( Even though they've got the tile products but she was too lazy to work)Then there's the type of these ethnic staff who will point you at the wrong direction. They tell you where the kitchen products are and point you to the direction of the wood products; or they tell you to go to the lighting areas for nails. Also, the girls from the same ethnic group use their cell phones. There are 2, 3 girls in the customer service all to most customers and the cameras that are focused on them should get them but I guess their supervisor must also be as lazy and naive as they are. According to the Canadian diversity, we all must be represented by all races because that is how unique we are. But this Lowes is practically a racist and a basket full of lazy, filled with excuses employees who are too annoyed to be asked a question; they also likely come from the same village and the same tradition which makes them stand out as the laziest of all creatures you can find in the diverse Canadian culture... They collect their pay checks offering with nothing more than just standing and walking around avoiding a customer with a question who chase them around the aisles. They reply to you when you caught up with them with the same script repeated many times that you can almost memorize the words. Although Canada is filled with people from all countries on earth, the group that Lowes hires is the only one that stands out in terms of laziness, excuses, not wanting to work, passing on a customer to someone else. They take on the easy ride to collect wages. When you are at Lowes because you have to buy items for your business, chances are, you won't get the results you expect and if you depend on these types of people, your business will collapse just as Lowes is collapsing because of the people they hire. If there is a law against concentrated hiring of majority of one race, this Lowes branch should be the first one to be sued. I'd avoid going to this store... If there is any other hardware where you can consult with staff and experts or help you find out someone else in the store who can help you, go to that store.

Lowe's Companies,It is absolutely amazing how horrendous…,"It is absolutely amazing how horrendous their supply chain management is, and they still be in business. It is truly unacceptable to not have something as simple as a dishwasher be installed within a quarter of a year after purchase. If they can't do better than that, they shouldn't be doing it at all. It says the dishwasher costs approximately $299 plus $149.00 for installation; but what they REALLY mean is that it costs that PLUS you having to miss work because they can only offer installation 9am-3pm Monday through Friday. Then if the dishwasher you do have finally installed is defective, and floods your entire kitchen, you have to miss work again to have it uninstalled. And that's not it, you have to miss work AGAIN to have a new dishwasher reinstalled at another time! Can they give you an exact time of when they will be by your house to install/uninstall? You guessed it, NO!!! So, you're now looking at missing multiple days of work having to wait around to cater to their convenience. Even though I have vacation time, do I think waiting around for multiple visits pertaining to, what should be, a simple dishwasher installation is my idea of a vacation??? Not-even-close-bud!!! They do not give a care about the customer, at all. I can see why Lowes' reputation is becoming bad, and I can no longer take this company seriously. They really do need help with their supply chain management, and I can honestly say this as a supply chain management professional.

Lowe's Companies,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE - I purchased over 3K of stainmaster carpet from Lowes -I have fought with Lowes for almost 2 years about problems with the carpet - in fact the carpet vendor is no longer used by Lowes- probably because the carpet was horrible. When I contacted Lowes they bounced me around for almost 2 years like a ping pong ball and now just today they tell me its not their problem it is with the ""vendor"" who by the way no longer sells to Lowes. Lowes does not stand behind their products AT ALL! Normally, I purchase a lot of home renovation items -and now as of today - I will only go to Home Depot - Lowes is the worst.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,"Bad installation, bad service","Bought a gas range for delivery from Lowe's Chicago Brickyard. Got it delivered and installed and then the first time I heated it the door window shattered. I blame Frigidaire, not Lowes for that, but after that, endless hassle. They are very hard to reach on the phone, so just rearranging things was difficult. Finally they delivered and installed it, but I wasn't there when they did it. First they didn't position the range all the way to the back wall, and I don't just want to jam it back there if I can't tell what's going on with the line. Second, they made zero effort to level it. It had a pronounced forward lean, and on trying to resolve it myself, I realized they had not with the turnscrews on the forward foot adjusters. Nothing! They were full tight. So I had to, on my own, lift the unit and try to level them. Still haven't been able to reach anyone. After Twitter complaints, someone at store called but I missed call ,and of course can't reach them back because NO ONE ANSWERS THEIR PHONE. Also, dealing with their delivery company is a pain in itself. Never again",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Carpet installers,"My experience with Lowe’s home installer’s. I ordered carpet from Lowe’s late September. I was excited because I saved my money up for 3 years to purchase the carpet. Fast forward- the carpet gets installed on 10/22/19. The guys moved my bedroom furniture from one room to the next including my treadmill. They dinged my door frames and my furniture has white paint to prove it. In addition, tacks were sticking out the carpet that made my foot bleed. In my son’s room a dip was in the carpet where they didn’t apply the padding. They chipped my bathroom grout from my tile. My baseboard in my room was dinged as well. I called and complained and initially the lady was nice and stated she would repair the problem and call the installers. You must understand that Lowe’s hires contractors to install the carpet. In my case the installer were NW Extreme Installers (Rich the owner) was nice in my face then told Lowe’s they didn’t do any of the damage. He also stated his workers only moved my bed and bedframe Well, Rich came out and took pics and said I would hear from him. A few hours later the gal from Lowe’s calls me and says the installers ( non-English speaking ) didn’t move any of my furniture and basically I made it up. Her whole attitude changed from my first conversation with the Lowe’s customer service representative. The low down is I moved my own furniture according to them. I will NEVER buy or come to Lowe’s again. I attached pictures to prove the damage they did. No, I didn’t move my own dressers, no I didn’t move my own elliptical. How in the world could I manage to do that independently? The rep from Lowe’s said spoke to her boss and said she’d supply me with gloss paint so I can paint my own boards. WTH. PLEASE BE WARE WHEN YOU PURCHASE FROM LOWE’S THEY CONTRACT WITH SCATCHY PEOPLE. BUYER BEWARE.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Missing part and no solution,"Ordered a heater for the balcony.

They never. Called them again and waited 30 minutes. Was told they would call me back soon. No way. You gonna refund me now I said. The agent told me he couldn't do that and since the heater was out of stock they could send me a new one when it's available... When? No idea! A friend of mine succeeded to add a replacement part but I can't say I'm a satisfied customer. By the way, it's been more than a month now and I'm still waiting for that infamous call from Lowe's.

Lowe's Companies,Purchased trees this past spring/summer…,"Purchased trees this past spring/summer from Lowe's in Mccomb, MS. I bought them approximately 4 or 5 months ago.( Green Giant Arborvaite ).Three out of 4 trees have died. I brought tags in from the trees that read 1 year GUARANTEE. Mistake #1: I lost my paper receipt. So then I was told by customer service that I had to go home and get the sku tag from the tree (blue tag that comes attached to tree) so they could ""look it up to see when the trees were purchased since I could not find my receipt "". ( She actually asked me when the exact day and month was when I bought the trees. SMH) Mistake #2: I did not ask if they needed any other additional information. So I drove 10 miles home and removed the sku tags from each tree, then drove back to Lowe's, brought in the sku tag and before they even looked at it, they informed me that I had to have a receipt. WHAT? Why they did not tell me this to begin with is beyond me. ( I think they get a laugh out of people wasting time and money driving back and forth ) Anyway, after returning to the store I asked to speak with the floor manager and he stated I "" Need to dig up the trees and put them in their original container and bring in my receipt"". I don't know what the general public does, but when I plant a tree, I cut the container down the side, gently pull the tree out and discard the container. So unless you are a hoarder, these containers are disposable! Whatever happened to actual customer help? It seems like after paying $47.00 per tree, they would want returned satisfied customers. I wasn't even asking for my money back. I just wanted to replace the trees with new ones, or even get some store credit. It's very discouraging as a loyal customer, and have them treat you this way without attempting to try to solve an issue. Lesson learned. Save your paper receipts, or start having receipts emailed. $140 loss on my part due to their ""store policy"" so they claim. I know I can't prove I bought the trees within a 1 years tim, but I have photos and video of the trees only because I'm an honest person which doesn't seem to mean anything nowadays.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,Worst home improvement experience ever!,"We purchased a total of 3 doors and 3 windows from Lowes and paid to have them installed. It has now been 16 MONTHS, and the project is just now completed. Problems included a Lowes salesman who lied to us just to get the sale, incorrect and defective items that had to be reordered multiple times, shoddy sub-par installations that had to be redone multiple times, and the worst ""customer service"" I've ever experienced. I made well over 100 phone calls throughout the project just trying to get Lowes to respond and to complete the project properly. Lowes' typical response is to make excuses, place blame elsewhere, outright lie about what is going on, or not to respond at all.We will never purchase anything from Lowes ever again or even set foot in a Lowes store.",0,1

Taking it back and will support Canadian Tire.I now know why Lowes is losing business and having to cut back, if they keep up this great work their next step will be to shut down their stores.

Lowe's Companies,Worst customer experience,"Corporate please do something about management, because this store is out of control. This store is the worst, I have worked retail before and even menards was a lot better company to work for than Lowe's. The attempted union that was formed against management due to continuous mistreatment and company policy violations, as well as inappropriate conduct. The store manager is the worst manager I had ever dealt with. Several employees also have started that he has made disgusting comments that no one should hear to them to promote the Lowe’s credit cards. Then would get mad at associates when they would refer people to Menards and would say to them, to just give them the wrong item even would not help the customer. The store manager was assistant store manager at another store, until he got fired for the same exact behavior he is doing at this store 1845. The manager and the other managers have also made discriminatory comments towards me about my disability, on a few occasions because, it was difficult for me to see the products in top stock when needed to get taken down for me as a customer.The store manager only care about money and nothing else just so he can come back to corporate since he got fired for giving out his password when he used to work for PeopleSoft. He is very manipulative and sneaky. He has told me and others that we can make reports against him but good luck trying because he knows people in corporate personally and they will just sweep it under the rug for him. We had the union incident happen to this store too a week before I got there because the management is so horrible. Management does not and will not give hours to employees because it effects his bonus checks which he said many times, and corporate cannot do anything about it. This store also really likes to play favorite and management is the absolute worst. They only care about making themselves look good and don't care about the employees. The manager would not call a ambulance for a employee that passed out from a heat stroke and low blood pressure because it would cost the store money. The managers I have mentioned also didn't want to call an ambulance and were instructed not to. They made associates take the employee to the hospital. The managers also promote people who doesn't deserve it because they stay on their good side and are a yes person to management, he will move people up the ranks so he doesn't have to hear anymore complaints from employees so the district manager would not have to get involved. Also, Store manager keeps people who no longer work at the store in the system so it does not effect his bonus checks and he can continue to keep the store understaffed.Management takes pictures of employees just to use as leverage against them and would always try to make you feel stupid while they played victim. Please corporate fire these managers, this store is getting way worse and extremely out of hand. I would come back if the store had different managers who weren't so greedy and very sneaky. They also like to black out and remove the negative reviews so no one will expose their dirty behavior. Managers would taunt and attempt to pressure associates into writing outlandish falsified statements that did not happen just so they can have leverage over that person person in question.Store manger will play into people’s needs once they are on his good side and are a yes person. He likes to protect those types, a prime example would be when a department manger had sex with a associate while working in paint and a customer complained. The manager gave that department manager, at that time a choice, to either step down from management or get terminated. She chose to step down and currently works there in receiving. Another example is when people would mess up and if they were on Managements good side, he would transfer them to another department without questioning their motives and reasoning behind the requested transfer. Managers would also spy on employees, and the store manager, would spy when employees coming in or going out of the store after he is done with his shift, on his day off which he actually has gotten reprimanded for by the district manager. He would come into work in his street clothes without the company vest on, and sit in his office for hours at a time. Or show up but only for a brief period and leave. He also likes to hide from customers and same with another manager, they do not like engaging or helping customers and the store manager condones this behavior from other managers cited. The people mention in this review only care about themselves and making sure that their position is secured and nothing will touch them, that is the problem with These people, they are way too comfortable being vile. Management would say that the store was “overstaffed” Not long after they had moved another associate to outside garden immediately just to fill that position. Management has also pulled associates into his office and threatening them to make falsified statements against other associates with no actual documented proof of any of the accusations made and instead gone by word of mouth from yes man associates who would not question his motives. He would also have associates spy on other associates to make sure nothing negative was said about him and his management style. He had pulled an associate away from me and my boyfriend when the associate was trying to help us with product assistance. He was questioned if he was shown anything offline meaning this report, and to stay away from negativity so he would not be corrupt, meaning me and my boyfriend. We could not get any shopping done and did not buy anything due to the constant harassment and associates following us to make sure that nothing was said about this report.",0,1

Most of the folks by phone you have to drag information out of, doesn't matter if you spend $5 or $2500 dollars. These folks need to be accountable for their action or in-action. Josh is one of the supervisor's at the store along with a young lady named Trish, it can almost seem like a game of ""catch me if you can"" to communicate with these people. So sad!

None of them are on the same page about any part of the processes involved.When we finally got the carpet ordered and paid for they changed the date, which in turn changed our move in date to the house we were buying. Again, a huge headache and very frustrating. They initially gave us a date of October 10th that the carpet would be in and to allow 48 hours to be contacted by the installer (Midwest Flooring).Surprisingly, we received a call from Midwest Flooring saying our carpet was in on Monday, September 30th and that they would be out to install it on Thursday, October 3rd. Naturally we were ecstatic. We again changed our move in date to Friday, October 4th. On the morning of our install I get a call from some mexican guy saying he cant find our damn carpet, saying the office said its at the warehouse and the warehouse says its at the office. If you can't tell, Midwest Flooring is about as unorganized and confused as Lowes is. So, after making phone calls to Lowes and Midwest Flooring I learn that they cant decide who screwed up and naturally, they're both blaming each other and neither will admit blame of course and now I'm told we're back to our original date of the carpet coming in on the 10th and who the hell knows when it will actually be installed at this point.

Lowe's Companies,DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH LOWE'S,"We purchased a refrigerator from Lowe's in The Woodlands, Texas on 9/9/19. We were told that delivery would be on 10/1/19, and agreed to that. On the evening of 9/30/19 we received a recorded call from the delivery company stating that delivery would be during the window 7:00 am - 11:00 am on 10/1/19, and we would receive a call about 30 minutes prior to delivery.We got up on the morning of 10/1 and unloaded the refrigerator, placing our food in iceboxes. I then disconnected the water supply, rolled the refrigerator out, and removed the door handles, thinking that I was doing the delivery people a favor. We then waited around all morning. At 10:45 am we received a call from Lowe's Woodlands store stating that the refrigerator would not be delivered that day, and would PROBABLY not be delivered until 10/17/19. Naturally, this upset me. I asked to speak to the store manager, and after a lengthy wait, he finally came on the line. He stated that he didn't know what was going on. Truthfully, he sounded like he had just woken up, and didn't seem to care one way or the other.I can understand a delivery being rescheduled; however what I cannot understand is why did we receive notification of the delivery on the night before, and why couldn't we be notified of the failure to deliver much earlier.

Not only was the door dented, but it wouldn't close correctly. When I called John, another manager, he stated that we refused a refrigerator that was not damaged. Finally, after three weeks of their nonsense, we purchased a refrigerator from Best Buy. Buyer beware! Don't buy their appliances unless you want to go through three weeks of repeated phone calls and be delivered damaged goods!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Latest Lowe's (Scam?) problem,"My wife and I decided to buy a washing machine from Lowe's in San Francisco despite the problems I had in the past with their delivery service. The sales person told me the appliance was in stock and we arranged to have it delivered. The night before delivery, I received a phone call from delivery stating they couldn't find the washing machine and they would contact the salesperson the next day and he would contact me. When I didn't hear anything by noon I began calling. An hour after I started calling and kept being thrown off their telephone tree (the worst I've ever been on) I finally got a person in delivery. She informed me that the salesman should have known the appliance wasn't in stock and I would be contacted when it arrived. Guess what? I'm still waiting.",0,1

I have a new apartment and I am a new customer with a new coop apartment. . Not only did I get disrespected multiple times by the current agents that work at the Rosedale ny location ,but I reconsideed my order almost 3 times. So now I canceled my order because I did not actually have someone Who was going to help me follow through with the ordered transaction but what is meant to feel as if my purchase was insignificant. After waiting on hold For multiple hours at work I still have not had a decent conversation with anybody that works at the location. I called the Ob corporate office and they also had trouble getting in touch with the Rosedale office operation system. I have made multiple attempts in getting a resolution to my issue but I did not. After attempting A new home owners loan and a brand new credit card opening from your company I was not issued the same bonus that I should have gotten through the attempt of credit card option at original action of a new home owner or New homeowner discount. With completes disappointment and multiple attempts to rectify the situation I had to cancel my order for my range top oven. I am very distraught and upset for the many many hours that I had to go through to get to this point. And now I don’t have a new oven in my new apartment which I never got the new homeowners discount. And on top of that I don’t have any reason to continue Relationship with Lowe’s",0,1

So i went there on a Saturday, found the plumber finally and ordered a door, okay, so far so good, found he was very helpful to a point, he told me that the store would call me in about 1 week to let me know that the door was in, because he said about 1 week, so i waited a week, never got a call. I then called the store and talked to the guy in plumbing, and he told me to come in the following Tuesday, because i called him on a Friday, and he said the door would be in, well, the door was not in, because there was a mix up from the vendor about delivery dates(strike 2..not very good communications) i then asked the associate when the door might be in, he said that if i waited, he would inquire about that, he saw that i was not pleased about when the door was going to be delivered, he then suggested to me about cancelling the order, why would he do that? i thought that he would go out of his way to see this sale of a door become complete, because thats what a good SALES associate would do (strike 3, bad customer service) he came out after finding out when the door would finally arrive, and told me to come back the following Tuesday, 1 week. I thanked him and said that would be ok. Tuesday, September 24th, 2019. I went to the store to pick up my door, i was excited, because it was finally in. I walked up to the service desk and told the associate that i was there to pick up my door, she said that it had been delivered, but to the wrong store which was 2 hours away, and they were working on getting it to the store that i ordered it from, well! i promptly told them to cancel the order, because i had had enough of this.

Lowe's Companies,Utterly Disappointed,"Several years ago I had a wonderful experience with Lowe’s; a beautiful kitchen remodel. So I’m truly disappointed by this incident today with Lowe’s scheduling service/delivery company. If there was a negative rating it would definitely apply here! On Sept. 17th, 2019 I purchased a small bathroom vanity at the Lowe’s Lincolnwood, IL store also paying for delivery which was scheduled for Thursday (9/19/19). On Wed. (9/18) an automated message was left on my answering machine that my delivery window would be from 7:30 to 11:30 AM the next day! “One hour forty minutes” after my window had expired I received a call from Lowe’s indicating the driver had one stop ahead of me! This is an unacceptable business practice mainly because the store had ample contact info to let me know that there was a delay! One hour 4o min later I received another call from the delivery company; a company rep. named Denny gave an explanation why the driver was so profoundly late with his deliveries. Basically, he stated that the store and the delivery service knew at 9:00 AM that deliveries were running behind. So my question is why didn’t someone contact me at that time?????? Common courtesy coupled with customer appreciation would dictate that someone would have notified me so I wasn’t waiting in vain! I’m truly disappointed with the treatment I received consequently I will be requesting a full refund to take my business elsewhere!",0,1

Since I’m not a plumber needed some assistance in choosing the right handle and additional items needed to complete the job. Was told by employee that someone from plumbing would be right over. 15 minutes later still waiting with not an employee in site. At customer service I asked to speak to manager. A supervisor named Courtney said she would call someone from plumbing; at that point I’d spent way too much timing trying to get assistance so I could purchase something.

Lowe's Companies,Very upset with treatment by Store Manager,Very upset with treatment by the manager this Saturday at the Renton Washington Lowes on Garden Ave.. I needed another sheet of exterior plywood for a project on one of my rental houses and had driven over 40 minutes to get to this store. I arrived to find the entire exterior plywood aisle blocked off for a kids play day and was told I would have to wait another hour or so before anyone would assist me in getting 1 sheet of plywood. Two of us could have easily gotten the sheet without bothering the kids. Why would they put the kids in a key aisle like this? Doesn’t make sense. I told the manager how inconvenient this was since I would have to come back on Monday. She just smiled at me and said “Have a nice day!” Totally clueless about the impact she was having on a customer. In the last two months I have spent thousands of dollars at this store to renovate the rental. Not anymore. Home Depot gets it from now on even if I have to drive further.

Lowe's Companies,DO NOT hire Lowe’s to install,"I’m going to share a story about a nice lady and her family that got screwed by Lowe’s. She purchased materials to redo a full bath and nice hardwood flooring and payed Lowe’s to install. Our company showed up to tackle the kitchen, the bathroom was already “completed” by the Lowe’s “professional”, flooring had yet to be installed. By far one of the worst tile jobs I’ve ever seen, tile not leveled, no bull nose and dried grout covering everything. The wall was damaged when the old vanity was removed and the handyman Lowe’s had do the work left the new vanity pushed up against the wall with nothing hooked up with a nice big damaged drywall section. Absolutely disgusting. We start our kitchen project, build a new pantry, refrigerator and cabinetry is moved around along with a breakfast bar section. We return after the floor is installed to install baseboard throughout the house. I receive a call a few weeks later that the new flooring is starting to buckle, Lowe’s handyman is trying to put the blame on us saying we jammed drywall in the expansion gaps. Pull a bunch of baseboard and take pics to prove to Lowe’s that Handy Manny is full of it. Floor continues to get worse, buckles so bad it’s standing 5 inches in a nice arch in the living room. Handy man wants to pull sections of the floor, cut them down in a table saw, and glue them back down. Home owner tells him to get lost and don’t come back. We call in a professional flooring company and they find that Handy Manny skimped out on the moisture barrier. Homeowner fought tooth and nail with Lowe’s to repair the shoddy tile and messed up floor. Lowe’s finally agreed to cover the repair. Homeowner has pro flooring company repair the floor, Lowe’s doesn’t honor the deal. Homeowner has to pay out of pocket for repair. Homeowner refuses to pay Lowe’s on remainder of materials initial install and Lowe’s takes them to court. Moral of the story: hire a licensed contractor for any work you need, Lowe’s uses handymen for their installs. I have other horror stories about repairs we had to do after a Lowe’s handyman stepped on a job site, maybe I’ll chime in with a few more.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Don't use Lowes for ANY home services!,"Where do I start?!? I purchased a new front door from Lowes, including installation. This was about 2 years ago. Now, the shims on the side of the door are pushing themselves out, the caulk is no longer sealing properly, the wood trim is splitting, peeling, and warping. I went to Lowes and they sent someone out to look at the door. They AGREED it was a mess and absolutely needs to be replaced. In fact, the lowes employee who came to take pictures said that there is no way should this be happening after only 2 years.Then, a week or two pass and I have heard nothing from anyone. So, I called the main installation number and I've been told that it does say in the notes that the door needs to be repaired. then, just like that, she says, ""But, you're outside the 1-year warranty so you'll need to fix it yourself."" She said that they sent someone out to look at the door, ""As a courtesy"" to me. WHAT!? A courtesy? A courtesy for what? Let me say that again... they sent someone out, agreed that the door is messed up, then said, ""good luck"". Why the heck did they even bother to send someone out if they weren't going to do anything about it? I don't need someone to agree with me that the door is messed up - I CAN SEE THAT WITH MY OWN EYES! Anyway, if you'd like a new, $4000 front door to last more than 2 years, do not buy from Lowes. Apparently, their doors only last 1 year. So, basically, they would rather lose a customer (and hopefully more than just me) than to stand behind their workmanship and their products. Seriously, what does it cost them to fix the door and keep a customer? Let's say it's a $200-$400 repair - that 200-400 dollars means more to them than having me as a customer. Well done Lowes.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"""DO NOT USE LOWES INSTALLATIONS!!!!"" We…","""DO NOT USE LOWES INSTALLATIONS!!!!"" We ordered a Vinyl Fence installation on April 2019. The sales person was not formal with the sale or the paper work. Our experience with Lowes was terrible from the sales person to the coordinators . It took 3 or 4 times for me to show Lowes where I wanted the fence installed. I even had pegs up for them. They ordered the materials. Attempted to start the project but the installer decided not to continue due to the ground being wet. Was scheduled for a later date. So the materials were returned to the store for storage. When the time came to start the project. The materials were delivered again I noticed the load seemed a little lite. When they started the project they placed the 5foot gate offset to my walkway which did not look right also the sales lady didnt tell me about the different gate sizes. Well anyway they started the fence and started to tell me that there isn't enough materials. To me that didnt make sense because the last measurement that LOWES wanted actually measured less so I didnt understand why LOWES was saying we were short material. Someone messed up and they wont admitte that they screwed up. So the thing they did was to blame the customer they said that I changed the fence layout. Which that is not true. I showed them the exact layout 3 times I showed the layout to the installer 2 times I also had pegs in ground where I wanted the fence. I also had to clean up the mess throughout the project which I should've been compensated. LOWES hung us out to dry. I over paid for this project. This was a 4 month project for a fence. We deserve compensation for this over exaggerated fence project. LOWES pushed their mistakes on the customer. Still wondering why I paid for extra material they said I didnt have enough of. I have material left over and now they won't let us return it. Forget trying to deal with the store. Corporate office didnt seem to care they pushed off to the coordinators. Lowes owes us some kind of compensation and take the unused materials.Thanks LOWEs for the screwing!!!Unhappy customer Hazleton Pa",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Exterior house project is a mess,"Exterior house project is a mess. They showed up, ripped the old siding off three sides of my house and took a solid week week to work on one side. This left the entire back side of my house exposed to an incoming storm. The storm rained into out attic and blew the spray insulation all over the yard/neighborhood. They said the project did not include insulation, which was certainly talked about during meeting. They painted the house the wrong color. They took away our rain gutters and are unsure if the project includes replacement (our gutters were fine). They measured our greenhouse for siding but did not do it, did I pay for this, unknown because they cannot give me an itemized list of the project. My yard is littered with insulation, garbage, and nails. Since leaving the military getting ripped off has become the norm. Im disappointed in Lowe's and in society in general.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Newington, CT Customer Service","My customer service today at the Lowe’s Hardware in Newington was the worst I have ever experienced. I went in to buy 2 boxes of nails and 2 outdoor resin patio rockers. Once at the checkout the cashier was holding up the line due to calling for assistance from one of the departments for the customer in front of me. The assistant never came although she called for help 3 times. The lady in front of me suggested she move to the side so the cashier could check out someone else while waiting for assistance - the cashier refused. 15 minutes later and now a total of 11 customers in the 2 check out lines we were told we could go to customer service for checkout, so we did.Once at customer service I relayed to the cashier I wanted to also purchase 2 of the white resin patio rockers on the outside of the store. I relayed to her they had a sign of $19.99 and a sign that said ALL Resin Rocking Chairs $9.99, what should the price be. As she shrugged her shoulders she said she did not know, pulled out a price paper and proceeded to charge me $39.99 each. I relayed that was incorrect-the sign stated differently. The cashier told me I could go get a product number, I asked if perhaps she could as I may not know what product number was correct - cashier relayed she had other customers to help. SO my grandsons went out, took pictures of what he thought was product numbers and came back. We were charged $19.99 each for the resin patio rockers. Once outside I asked the ladies that came to get the rockers for us what the price should be (Ashley and another associate) they looked, checked something on their device and replied $9.99. Luckily Ashley and the other associate did display good customer service, asked me if I would come back in they would give me a refund. Shopping should not be this hard - Lowe’s Hardward - it will be a long while before I shop your stores again and if I do it will not be the Newington, CT store.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Refuses to stand behind Washer sold by their store,"Lowe's will not stand behind a product sold by them in Manchester, CT. Bought a new top-load GE washing machine 11 months ago & it totally broke down. Had tech come from GE as advised; needs 5-6 replacement parts including motor! We did not do anything to cause this. Spoke with Lowe's Mgr. who put responsibility totally on GE, said we had to deal with them, not Lowe's. Are they kidding? Have owned a retail business ourselves for years & never heard of this. GE is sending a tech for second time to replace parts sent to me, will take half a day at the least. Husband must take a second half day off. Have been without a washer for over a week. We will pursue this before having machine repaired (at no charge this time!). Lowe's should be dealing with their supplier. A full refund & return of this broken machine is in order.

I can only say that from the very top of this company and culture being created by Marvin Ellison has made this a terrible company to buy appliances or window treatments from. I will not list the details of my problems as it would fill up pages, but I did contact the Corporate Customers Service (Should be re-named to Completely non-important personnel with No Ability to deal with Customer Issues!) and gave them on 10 different occasions about my on going problems, escalated each time to another level, lat time she said to the SVP Level....BS. Or SVP Level should all be dismissed. I don't blame the customer service personnel, they have been trained to say the same thing and do anything necessary to protect company profits, seriously customers must be considered the biggest problem for Lowes to deal with. I will help them by NEVER stepping foot into one of their stores until they have the look anticipated GOING OUT OF BUSINESS Event! If you can buy anything from another store anywhere near their price do so in a hurry. Actually I would gladly pay 50% more to Home Depot, Best Buy, Anyone than to deal with this company.

Lowe's Companies,DO NOT ever hire Lowe’s for a home…,"DO NOT ever hire Lowe’s for a home project!!! Our home had hail damage so we hired them to do the $80,000 project. It has been over a year and the job still is not complete. We have had “7” different crews- all sub-contracted. When I call the building specialist, Arik Bowen, he won’t return my calls. We never knew if and when they were coming. One group drank alcohol on their lunch hour and went up three stories high afterwards. They began their workday at 11:30 and left before 4:00. The last ones had to be taken home an hour away by my husband because they did not have a car. Most of the workers took off a month or two before returning. One group even took some of the new siding out of the boxes and put it in their truck. (We took pictures and video of them.) We tried returning some of the siding that we didn’t need (after we paid for it) and were told we couldn’t because we had it too long. I called the main office and was told they couldn’t do anything. I am done making calls and will have to contact an attorney. Our contract with Lowe’s has a completion date of October 31, 2018. Today is August 28, 2019! I would never hire Lowe’s again!!!

Lowe's Companies,$12K Fence with no handles for opening/closing,"New Carrollton, MDIf I could give 0 stars, I would. Purchased in April 2019 a composite fence ($12K) delivery and installation. Now the problem begins. Opening and closing for three gates - No handles on any of the gates. Installer (Lowe's contractor) made adjustments such as inverting hardware whereby the closing mechanism usually found on the inside of the gate is on the outside thus creating a way to open the gate from the outside. However, on the inside of the gate you must pull on it to close. Quite Innovative! On the second gate, only a thumb latch and no handle. Only two of the three gates have tension support. Bar code on each of the pickets were still attached and now falling off. Wish I could post pictures. Been calling Lowe's customer service since late April, early May, 2019. After many calls, Bill White, Project Coordinator, gave me his email address saying ""best way to reach him."" After many emails he finally flat line. No response to my email. Back on the phone with customer service. New Project Coordinator, Robin. She tried resolving the matter to no avail, when finally I called as was asked to AGAIN provide information on what was the nature of my problem. Loosing it, I now have a new Project Coordinator (number 3) Michelle who states that they dropped the ball and she will get the matter resolved.Today, 8/28/2019, I received a call from a representative, who did not identify himself, at the New Carrollton store, saying that he was following up on some old request quotes from Phillip and if I was still interested, please give the store a call. Which I did. Again to get a store customer service who clearly states, he see lots of notes and no resolution. Several times while speaking with customer service(877-505-4923), I asked for Regional Manager. Finally today, I got her name, Ms. Tamala James. Waiting on a call from her.The very thing that Lowe's sell you on, ""Buy and contract with us, you will never have any problems with being bounced around when you have problems with product or installation.""

I have water damage in every wall where a window was replaced, I have mold, and all of my wood floors will need to be replaced as well. Worst customer service ever. I have spent countless hours on the phone trying to deal with all of these problems and was not successful. We are now in a lawsuit. Do yourself a favor and NEVER use Lowe's for any work. They subcontract everything. I am pretty sure they hire the cheapest people they can get because they could care less about their customers. I am a single mom just trying to make my home a safer place. $24,000 later and I am praying that these windows that are installed incorrectly hold during this upcoming hurricane.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Extremely uncaring.,"This is going to be kinda long so please bare with me and read it all because it's very important. Not too long ago I applied for a position at this Lowe's: * 2896 North Road US-178 Orangeburg, SC 29118 * and it was hands down the WORST job/interview experience of my life. Before I tell you the whole story i'm going to give you some details that way it'll make the story easier to understand. 1. The owner of the store and all the employees are african american 2. I'm white 3. There was only two people applying for the position, me and another girl who was african american 4. I have over 4 years of experience working in warehouses which is what they were looking for and the other candidate had none and had just graduated from highschool. I applied for the postion online and the very next day was contacted and told to come in the next day for my interview. My interview was at 8:00am, got there about 20 minutes early was waiting and waiting and after waiting even more I wasn't interviewed until 10am and didn't get out of there until almost 12. While I was waiting I was treated very badly, I was ignored but the other canadite was given the welcome wagon they all treated her like they've been friends for years, most people would probably think ""oh she's probably just better at talking to people and you aren't"" WRONG she was extremely rude, backoffish and didn't say more then 10 words the entire time we were waiting even the look on her face was extremely unpleasant whereas with me I was very polite, tried to be pleasant despite how I was being treated and love talking to people. The interview: Once again hands down the worst, my interviewer cursed, was extremely fake ""praised"" my experience even brought in the owner of the store when finding out I had worked at Amazon for over 4 years because apparently ""he loves taking employees from their competition"" basically insert praise bs lies here and I stupidly believed that I had it in the bag but oh no not even an hour later they email me a copy and paste email letting me know they went with the other candidate. At first I didn't think much of it but later on that day it finally clicked. They were racist and not only that but lied to me made me believe I had it only to shoot me down later which I honestly believe was a part of their game. The funny thing is i've shopped at this location many times before applying and always had bad experiences there with racist lazy staff but as they say hindsight is 20/20.But what makes all of this even worse is I contacted Lowe's corporate not too long afterwards telling them about what had happened to me and I was treated just as badly by them. They didn't even apologize, gave me a copy and paste response and gave me a bunch of numbers and told me to call them and tell them.... like excuse me? YOUR company treats me badly i'm the victim here yet they honestly expect me to do all that? No doubt in my mind if it had been the other way around (nothing but white employees and an african american trying to apply) something would've been done ASAP.Goes without saying that I haven't been to that Lowe's since then and refuse to ever shop at their stores again. If you've been through this as well then please speak out about it, they wouldn't listen to me but they'll have no choice but to when more people speak up about it.",0,1

We can see where he wrote it in the notes but never actually scheduled the delivery!” Then was given a delivery date of two days later. This is AFTER I’ve sat around for 12 hours at home waiting on them. When I complained again I was told that they are doing the best they can and that mistakes happen and I should just get over it. This is a $4000 refrigerator I told them and added that I already paid in full for it and therefore they weren’t doing me any favors and didn’t need to act as if they were. I asked the store manager for his full name and he refused to give it to me. I asked for his bosses name and he stated he didn’t know it.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Poor Service,"Although I enjoy shopping at Lowe's, my experiences with delivery and installation services have been close to disasters. Four years ago I ordered a washer. Next day delivery, free installation, and free removal of the old machine were all promised on tv and in print ads. The machine was delivered after four days. First red flag! After a quick and expert installation, the delivery persons turned to leave, leaving behind the old machine. I asked them to take it, as this was part of the deal. They said they would take it for $25. I called my local store to complain while the delivery people waited and was told that the promotion had ended two days earlier! I should have learned my lesson. However, the lure of reliable brands, great variety, and decent prices kept me coming back. This summer on August 2, I purchased a new bathroom vanity (w/ sink and new faucet) for my parents. I also paid for Lowe's delivery. The items were scheduled for delivery on August 14. My parents waited from 8 AM until 8 PM- no delivery! When I called to complain I learned that the delivery had never been scheduled. However, I had gotten an email confirmation and two phone calls reminding me that the delivery window was 12 hours! After profuse apologies, Lowe's rescheduled the delivery for Tuesday, August 21. I threatened to cancel the order so Lowe's promised delivery Sunday, August 18. Again, no delivery August 18! I was told that the earliest delivery date was now the 21st. I no longer trust Lowe's, especially after having my parents cancel their plans and wait around for 16 hours. I canceled the order.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowe's Awful Service,"Called Lowe's in Xenia Ohio for some indoor outdoor carpet. They verified they had what I wanted. I get there and they did not have the length I need. I have the Xenia Ohio store call the Beavercreek Ohio store and verify they have the same item number in the indoor outdoor carpet. With that confirmed I drive to that store. They did have the length needed either. I have them call the Centerville Ohio store. They verify the item number and length. I get there and they barely have what I needed even though their inventory said otherwise.After spending nearly 2 hours driving around when I returned to the office I called Lowe's customer care that afternoon, August 8th to tell them about this. All they did was offer an apology. I asked what about all the money spent in fuel driving around because your inventory system is inaccurate. Again only an apology after documenting what happened. It's been 10 days since and have heard nothing from them. We can shop elsewhere. The other irritating part was when the person at the Beavercreek store called the Centerville store, I overheard them having a chit chat which had nothing to do with checking inventory for the item I was attempting to purchase. I had to interrupt that person and remind them that, you are calling that store to help me identify inventory not have a conversation about corporate conducting an audit at your store. Lowe's inventory is not accurate and associates need retrained on how to update inventory and maintain focus on the customer!On 8/23/2019 I gave Lowe's a follow up call on the original complaint filed on 8/8/2019. The representative said that the complaint filed went to the ""store"" I asked, which one? The rep says, let me read. She did not know because there were three stores. Exactly!! This is a corporate level issue. She says, do you want me to call one of the stores? I replied stating this complaint needs to go to someone at the corporate level that makes decisions. If the same problem is happening at three different stores then it is likely happening at other stores. This complaint needs to go up the chain to regional management. This rep was a box of rocks when replying, well I'm not sure how that works, that's not the procedure. Still nothing from lowes. 9/2/2019",0,1

Lowe's Companies,AUGUST 12,"AUGUST 12, 2019 POTTSTOWN LOWES - MANAGER JOE Would give zero stars if i could. Bought an above range microwave in June. When the installer brought it, it was different on the inside than the display model. Had it installed anyway and when I went to use it, the turntable didn't turn. Returned it, went to the store and discussed this with Jay in appliances. Jay was extremely helpful but sadly, Jay is not the installer or the store manager, both of which are not very helpful. I purchased another microwave and Lowes took three weeks to install it. When the day came for installation, the installer installs another that has a different inside - ok so obviously this is now what they look like and for whatever reason the floor model is different. He leaves and when I go to use it, the timer doesn't work and on occasion, the microwave does nothing when I turn it on. I call the store manager, who now knows me by name. It is mid July. I purchase a completely different microwave and it takes several days to come in. Once it is in, I wait another week for the installer to come install, but on the day of installation find out that the order for the installer is to come troubleshoot the second microwave NOT install the new one. She comes out and says, yep this one is broken! NO KIDDING!. Another week goes by and my new microwave gets installed. Once installed we realize that it is tilted down in the back and the door swings closed and hits everyone in the face or head when trying to use it. I call the manager last wednesday as well as the installer and NO ONE have called me back - it is Monday. I will NEVER purchase from Lowes again and seeing the reviews, I am not alone! Lowes!

Lowe's Companies,Shake down by their contractor,"Since when did the home repair business become a condoned shake down at Lowes?After an emergency door replacement following a break in, I went to Lowes and put a $35 deposit down for their door contractor to come and assess the ill fitting door for replacement. The contractor told me he could replace the entire unit but I would not be able to put my security storm door back on as the new units did not have a flush Mullion (center post between the door frame and side light.) He suggested that he could have the door department shop and find a unit that had the flush mullion. I went to Lowes and talked with the door department and had to describe the problem to them as the contractor had not noted the issue. The gentleman offered to try to find a flush mullion assembly. It has been three months and I am still waiting for the call. No attempt has been made to return my $35.00 or come and replace the door unit. Nice follow up Lowes. A home repair service company would not charge to assess the job and would be hungry enough to find the unit and install same. I have no faith in Lowes repair program.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Treatment of Hispanic Customer,"Friend attempted to return a purchase (with receipt) to Fruitville Store in Sarasota, FL, but Salesman refused saying item was ""dirty"" (it was a plumbing fixture used in drainline outdoors). Friend objected, stating it had gone to the job site but never used. Salesman became angry and said to Friend and grown son who was also there: ""I'M GOING TO CALL IMMIGRATION ON YOU!"" Friend is Legal Resident for decades, son was born here - neither even has an accent, not that it matters. No one asked for immigration status when the item was purchased. Attempted to speak with Store Manager, who was unavailable. Called Tampa District Office but District Manager will not speak with us until we talk to the Store Manager.

Lowe's Companies,Return,"I bought a power washer from Lowes when I tried to start it it never would start, I paid around 289.00 for this power washer and I never was able to use it, not once. Lowes told me that they do not return power washers no matter what. I was sold a product that I was never able to use I could maybe understand if I had used it for awhile and then something happened and it broke but it never worked. I feel like they stole my money. This is a horrible way to treat your customers",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lost a customer,"I recently moved and placed an order which accidentally went to my old address. My error- curse Google autofill though- but it's nowhere to be found. The new owners insist they brought it back to the local UPS store but UPS has no further data beyond that it was delivered at the old address. Lowe's won't do anything until they receive the order back, assuming it is ever received. So I'm out $84 rather than Lowe's stepping up and taking the hit, for which I'm sure they have insurance. I understand it was my error, but how they can do nothing to help is beyond me.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I just read several negative comments…,"I just read several negative comments as I was searching for a best place to complement one of Lowes employees, specifically, Tiffany in blinds at the Charlottesville Store. She is so helpful and seemed to genuinely enjoy helping me find the ‘just right’ blind for my decor. She simply has a way about her that made me feel confident in my custom blind purchase by being very knowledgeable about measuring and placement. She is a real delight and a valuable asset to your company. I also want to comment on some of what I just read. Certainly I have had issues with purchases over the past 28years of homeownership. I have experienced Lowes genuine desire to ‘make it right’. I once purchased an item that was missing the Allen wrench. I stated to the rep that I did not want to drive from my home in Belmont to 29N to pick up the tool. The rep was patient and understanding and said he would mail it to me. I received a phone call a few days after it arrived from that same Lowes rep to insure the delivery had occurred. Another time I replaced a ceiling fan that malfunctioned in the same manner that the initial one had. The remote was not working. The 1st replacement fan was sent to me at no charge however a couple of months later the replacement (fan #2)malfunctioned similarly to the one I had just replaced. By now I am getting pretty frustrated with the whole thing. When I called customer service, I insisted that I did not want the same Lasco Fan that had by now broken twice. I also did not want to pay my handyman to install it a third time. I paid the difference for a better quality fan and they paid me 50.00 for the install. While the fan drama was very frustrating, Lowes did work with me to make it right. There are going to be issues when a store has such high volume but in my experience if you insist gently or otherwise, they will go the extra mile. Thank you Lowes!",0,5

Lowe's Companies,HORRIBLE customer service!,"Up to this point, I have been a loyal Lowe's shopper. Purchased an LG refrigerator, washer and dryer, and numerous in-store items. So when it came time to replace my stove and over the stove microwave, I went to my go-to. Placed the order on-line no issues late Thursday. Received an email that my order was processing. This is the last time that I heard from Lowe's. Today, Sunday, I was talking about the order with my mom and I had concerns that installation was not on the order so we called the store where Lowe's, in their infinite wisdom, felt my items should be shipped, W. Dallas. I live in N. Ft.Worth. I was made aware that my items were being delivered TODAY, Sunday. No call. No confirmation that I would be available, no heads up that they were even coming. My mother was able to get ahold of Ariana in their corporate offices who assured my mom that the delivery was canceled and that a manager would be contacting me within 24-hours to set up a new delivery date. While this was occurring, I was on the phone in three separate calls to the Dallas store. In these three calls, I experienced a hang-up, an incredibly long hold to the point that I hung up and called them back, to what I thought was a solution to my no installation charge. I was told that I could just go to the Lowe's closest to my house and sign an installation contract. Great! The manager was supposed to call me back and I could add installation to my order. Crisis averted.So, when I get BACK IN TOWN, I head to Lowe's thinking this was all behind me. Wrong. They can't look up my order. They can't cancel my order. They don't know why I was told to come to them. Only orders in THAT STORE can be pulled up. Needless to say, I was not happy so I asked for corporate's number where I myself spoke to Ariana and CORPORATE is unable to do anything. She has to send a report to the store to have this item canceled. Since the manager was supposed to already call me back, I called the store and asked to speak to the manager, after a lengthy hold and explanation of what was going on she said that she would cancel the order but that she had to go to a register so could she call me back? Yep, I am STILL waiting for her to call me back.Lowe's, you have lost a 20+ year customer. I will NEVER set foot in your store again.",0,1

I am asking people out there to stop buying at Lowe's until they make it right with my mom and dad who are now in their 70's. Shame on Lowes for making money dishonestly off of my parents who live on Social Security and month to month. They saved and saved to buy the flooring and then got taken by this uncaring giant multi million dollar company who refuses to make this right. Don't buy Lowes.

Eventually I get my butt to Lowes, find the perfect fridge and purchase the thing. [I wanted to buy a scratch and dent but they refused to help me install it - unlike home depot. Yes, I should've used HD but they didn't have the right scratch and dent].One week later I get a call that it'll be delivered the next day - but I'm like hold on I can't do be home then let's wait till next week. So next week comes and I get a call saying delivery is tomorrow (Great!). 4 hours later that same day I get a call, ""Uh hello, is this Colleen? Hey, Hi - uh... we lost your fridge"" ME: ""..."" Them: ""Yeah we can't find it anywhere"" (How do you lose a fridge, Lowes?). ""And it'll be 10 days till we can get it deliver again"". WTH?? Bless up I didn't get rid of my other fridge already. Anyway I'm mad but hey they gave me some money back (only 10% back... BS if you ask me). 10+ days later I get a voicemail from Lowes ""Hi Colleen, please call in to reschedule the delivery of your fridge"" Me: ""Reschedule?"" ... I call in and they told me they tried to deliver it today, but I'm like ""Why the HECK didn't you call me to tell me this?"" (seriously, I checked all recent calls and nothing from them). They are like ""..."" and I'm like ""If you deliver it by Friday I won't FLIP all the TABLES in your store"" Also I'm pretty sure my phone number is black listed because during this time period I called Lowes 40+ times - 90% of which I either got dropped or hung up on. Get it together Lowes-Anyway Friday comes, the fridge fits, and I now have cold food again. What a ride that I hope I will never go on again...",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Worst customer service,"IAm appalled by the customer service at Lowe's in Arlington Heights, IL. I first visited Vernon Hills Lowe's to purchase an electric lawn mover that was on sale. They don't have any more left in stock but the sales associate who is a marine vet provided excellent service. He looked up other nearby stores that have the lawn mower in stock. I opted to go to Arlington heights location as it is the next closest one to me. The associate even called this location to make sure they have in stock as he said sometimes their network systems do not accurately reflect the counts. He also mentioned just to take the picture of the price tag on the aisle just in case. I thanked him for his service and drove to Arlington heights Lowe's to buy my lawn mower. The parking lot was very dirty and carts stewn every where. I couldn't find a flat bed trolley so asked an associate. He was so non chalant and rude, he just told me to go look around for one. Anyway, I picked up mower but noticed it didn't reflect the sale price on the aisle. I took it to the check out thinking that they would adjust the price there. It came up as regular price. I told her about the sale price and my story and even showed her the photo I took earlier. She doesn't seem to be interested at all and kept on saying the price that rang up is the final price and she can't do anything. I went to customer service and asked for the store manager. Mike, the store manager came out and just like the associates I came across in the store doesn't seem to be interested in taking care of the situation. He simply said he cannot honor the price from the other lowes store. I mean come on..... I am not even asking to price match a different retailer, but their own Lowe's price. I was so disappointed with this episode and their worst customer service. I would never visit this store again.",0,1

U get to keep it for no reason. I purchased 6 of 3 gal primo on June 22. Because of Ecoli problem in Long Beach New York. I put them in my kitchen my bathroom everywhere around my restaurant. Just to make sure no one is using the tap water. Now the water problem is solved. I wanted to return the 5 empty bottles to Lowe’s and keep 2 in my restaurant. But Lowe’s won’t take the bottle back and won’t give me credit. They told me to call Primo water. Which they didn’t know how to contact them. So I have to googled myself. I finally get to talk to someone she said unfortunately they don’t give cash value or any credit the bottle is mine. I’m not sure if it make sense to anyone. So I put hay the bottle filled water for around $14. That’s including the bottle. Now I returned the bottle. But can’t have credit. I can only do exchange. But I don’t need 6 at once any more.

Lowe's Companies,AN ENDLESS STREAM OF HORRIBLE NIGHTMARES - DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!,"STARTED LOOKING FOR NEW FLOORING IN JANUARY 2019 FOR RENTAL HOME.Experience pertains to Lowe's, 100 Connecticut Ave, Norwalk, CT and to Corporate.* Lowe's gave me price quote after price quote to replace incorrect previous estimates they gave me, totaling over 12. Took 5+ months to nail down what I guess was a correct price but who really knows!* Assigned flooring specialist who was consistently rude, nonresponsive, poorly informed, insolent, snarky, even hanging up on me twice mid-conversation b/c (1) he didn't want to write a second estimate, and (2) b/c the flooring installed had separated in a couple of spots and he apparently didn't want to deal with it!!!* When first estimate for entire house was very high, I asked flooring specialist to give me a quote for a smaller area of the house. He left me the following VM: ""Has your landlord approved flooring because if not, it's not worth my time to work on a second estimate.""* Delivery of 28 long, very heavy boxes of floor planks plus underlayment, plus long transitions, plus install materials ~ a lot of very heavy materials ~ which Lowe's delivery attempted to leave at the curb for me to carry in until I told them I wasn't accepting delivery, take it right back to Lowe's.* Lowe's flooring contractor rescheduled installation from a week and a half out to the following morning at 5:10 p.m. b/c he had a last minute cancellation, which he only relayed to me even then b/c I called about something else. Meaning I had to reschedule gas disconnect and move things from rooms to be installed!!* After installing, contractor left disconnected stove in the middle of the kitchen floor. I asked four or five times for him to move it back and reconnect. Ignored.* THEY TOOK MY TOILET OFF AND LEFT IT IN MY TUB because they said ~ AFTER THE FACT AT THE END OF THE DAY ~ they were not licensed to reconnect it!!! I have one bathroom so they left me w/o a toilet overnight and into the next day!* Because more workers sent than anticipated or prepared for, workers took all my things I hadn't yet moved -- everything -- and just tossed it all haphazardly into three bedrooms. There were three rooms piled high with home furnishings, furniture, critical work-related things, loose medications, paperwork -- tossed everywhere.* They broke accordion slide of a window AC and there remains a gapingly huge hole - both long and wide - to the outdoors, one through which animals can easily fit. I had wondered at the oddness of the project manager taking me out to the back deck to point out that the air conditioner didn't seem like it was securely in the window!?! Which to that moment it certainly had been for 26 years.* Rebate form, which THEY gave me and for which I clearly qualified, returned to me at rebate payment date saying it didn't qualify. When I went back to the store to have flooring manager resolve it, he tried to call, let it ring about 45 seconds,and hung up. When I asked was he going to call back to resolve this for me his response was, ""I just did. They didn't answer. What do you want me to do? Just return the form."" * The floor planks began separating in several places, very wide and very long, a few weeks after being installed!* I emailed photos of separating planks with a note to Paton Larkin, flooring specialist, with copies to Marvin Ellison, president & CEO; Noah Powell, executive customer service center; Fred Schlott, store manager; Rebecca Troy, assistant store manager; John Murphy, flooring specialist. My close was: ""Please let me know immediately how Lowe's plans to fix this very serious problem."" I heard back from exactly ZERO people. I called Paton myself over 24 hours later and when I explained what had happened his response was an elongated, ""Okaaaaayyyyyy?"", as in ""What do you want me to do about it?"" I was speechless at first. Then I told him I wanted him to be responsive this time and take care of the issue. HE HUNG UP ON ME MID-SENTENCE. Literally hung up the phone.* The homeowner paid for a major portion of the flooring ~ thousands of dollars. She asked for a receipt b/c she was never sent one. To this date, in spite of several requests, they have not sent her a receipt nor are they apparently able to locate one to do so. Last week, a CSR emailed me saying he was attaching the receipt. There was no attachment. Keystone Kops could not write these scripts. I asked him to resend. I have still not received a receipt!* FYI, my experience was that virtually NO ONE at Lowe's takes seriously responding to you or answering the phone. Each time I had to go in to the store for resolution, which were several, I waited at that counter at least one-half hour. Every single time! Without any assistance or desire from employees to help or follow through. And I watched as the phone there would ring and ring and ring and no one would pick it up, recognizing how many times I had also called hoping someone would answer. As apparently they stood there. And just looked at it.If you decide to use Lowe's in spite of all shared, go with god.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,WOW I don’t know where to start,"WOW I don’t know where to start. A month ago I call Lowes and placed a service call for a GE Dishwasher I purchase 6 months ago. The tech came in check the machine and said he had to order parts. Once I received the parts he returned GE/Lowes send the wrong part so here we were waiting another 2 weeks before he returned. Finally the part was received he came back, but still the machine was not working. The tech and his associate took the machine apart and told my husband that the dishwasher was not repairable due to the fact the rats had damaged the cables. (They left the machine taken apart and the electrical cable was loose and live they did not even suggested to my husband to turn off the power to the machine. (I cannot bring myself to think what would of happen if water would fall on the floor around the area where the live electrical cable was) then to top it off I receive a call a few minutes later from someone in GE/Lowes Accusing me of having a rat infestation and they could not guarantee the machine that I needed to get a professional exterminator to control the rat infestation before they can come back out and service the machine and that they had pictures to proof the we had Rats. (I guess they saw the RAT) First of all I did not have a rat infestation. What I did have was a hamster that got loose in my house and could not catch. We had no idea that is was in the kitchen since the hamster was originally in the second floor. (Little fellows do travel). I always purchase my appliances from Sears this was the first time that I ever purchase an appliance from Lowes and it will be the LAST time. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND LOWES FOR APPLIANCES TO ANYONE. Their service department is very unprofessional and jump to conclusions before even asking or telling the homeowner what they think is going on. We purchase another machine from SEARS and took the old machine out since it was going to be toss out my son decided to check it out and see if he could repair it he took the one cable that was chewed up by the hamster and spliced it together and the machine is working. So much for unrepairable. Oh, and I have pictures to prove that it is working It isn’t so much waiting for the parts and telling me that we had a rat infestation (I know what my house has) but for the unprofessionalism and the way they handled the situation and for putting my family and dogs at risk of electrocution.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,The worst customer service,The worst customer service. I checked on the Lowe's website for an item. It said there were 57 in stock. I went to the store to get one.

There were two ladies up there. One completely ignored me and walked away while the other was on the phone. She then tried to help me but the phone kept ringing so she had to answer the phone about 5 times before she actually helped me. The other lady was pretending to be busy but was just shuffling papers around the counter. The lady helping me finally was able to check the website and saw the item I was looking for & saw that is said it was in stock. She called someone else and was told this was a special order item and it was not in stock.

It was 6:30 pm and Lowe's in St. Petersburg, FL 4th Street location was still open but the phone rang for 10 minutes and then they hung up on me. I called back and it rang for another 16 minutes before anyone answered. The next day the refrigerator was to be delivered. The driver was to call 30 minutes prior to arrival. He called and was here in 3 minutes. Then he refused to deliver my appliance. I called XPO Logistics and they said that they would come back and I would be the last stop. At 9:05 still no delivery and I call back...they took my refrigerator back to the store and closed the delivery ticket.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,The worst customer service experience…,"The worst customer service experience have received in years, the rudeness starts from the operator to the manager and they are not even aware because they are comfortable with the bad behaviors.

Lowe's Companies,OK not happy,"OK , I bought a Pirier frost free outdoor faucet here a month ago and it started spewing water out of the top of it . They did honor my request to exchange it . I installed it and three weeks later the exchange one did the same thing. ( my water pressure isn't the problem, it's fairly low ) anyways I decided to get the repair kit for it , and they don't even carry them for the vacuum (top of the faucet) so I ordered one one line . Part #630-7500 SMH come on Lowe's REALLY!!!! This is the part of the faucet that is most acceptable to failure !!!! I most likely won't be purchasing another outside faucet from them again . I even asked one of their sales representatives and he tried looking it up on his computer or phone whatever they carry with them and he said that they don't even stock them !!! AGAIN SMH !!!!! he stated that they have the main guts for it but not what I am needing . Although ILowes is one of my go to for all my needs I'm having some second thoughts about this also. So before you buy a frost free faucet anywhere!! Chech that they carry the vacuum valve for the top side !!!!",0,3

Lowe's Companies,Absolutely worst experience when trying…,"Absolutely worst experience when trying to do an online order for delivery fulfilled by the Silverdale, WA store. Needed to order some fiberglass roofing panels, and Lowe's was the only place that had them relatively nearby (although still more than an hour's drive away). I went to place the order via their website for delivery, and figured that I'd check to see what it would cost to get all the materials from vs from the Home Depot a few miles away from my house. Prices were comparable, and the website said that delivery would be $104 either way if I went with just the roofing panels or the entire order. Made sense, since they're sending a truck out it would cost the same no matter if it was just a little on the truck or a fair sized order. So I ordered via their website, received a confirmation email that confirmed the prices (including the delivery cost) and figured that would be it. The next day I checked the order status on their website and that's when the entire process went sideways. The website showed that delivery would be $213, many of the items shows the wrong price (including that it said that the calk was -$0.06 each, and yes, that's a negative price), the pressure treated 4""x4""x8' boards were listed twice, once for pickup and once for delivery (but unlike the other delivery items the status for it was blank instead of being ""in process""), and there was an unknown charge listed as a ""price adjustment"" for $84.72, and none of the amounts added up correctly to what it should have been or the total cost shown there. So I called customer service and spoke to a representative, who said that in their system the order was correct, and the $213 was the ""correct"" delivery cost. Couldn't give any answers as to why it didn't show that when it was originally ordered, and also didn't see the price adjustment on her computer (and couldn't give any answers as to why it shows differently on the website). She ended up sending me a copy of the order confirmation email to show how the order was received in their system, and it showed the 4""x4"" as being for pickup and the higher delivery cost then the original order confirmation email that I received. Because I didn't want to wait on hold again, I emailed their customer service about the discrepancies, attaching PDF copies of that was shown in my original order confirmation email, the Lowe's website, and the order confirmation email that the customer service rep had forwarded to me. The ""Johnna M."" who responded to my email essentially ignored most of my concerns and questions, but said that she would have someone from the Silverdale store call me to see about adjusting the delivery cost. In the meantime I had received the fiberglass roofing, delivered from the Bremerton, WA store but the paperwork indicates that it was ""sold from"" the Silverdale store (Bremerton is just a little further away from me and right next to Silverdale). The order was placed Saturday night and those were delivered the next Wednesday. A couple of days later I finally got the delivery scheduled for the following Monday for the rest of my order with a delivery window of 8AM to 8PM. I got an email that morning that the 4""x4""s had been picked up, so I figured that they had figured it out and put them on the truck for delivery with the rest of the order. Waited home all day, and at 7PM got a voicemail that the driver had ran out of time that day and they had already rescheduled the delivery for the following Saturday and given me a 10% discount of the entire order. Even though they never had called about the extra delivery charges, the 10% off worked out be about the same as the additional delivery charge so I was just going to let it slide. The materials did come that Saturday, minus the 4""x4""s (two week after initially placing the order, and a week and a half after Bremerton was able to deliver their part). No idea why they didn't just do the entire order from one store and in one delivery, but the delivery drive was quite personable, helpful, and courteous, puting the materials exactly where I asked. He was perhaps the only bright spot in the entire process. Had to call customer service again about the missing 4""x4""s (since I had already been charged for them), and they contacted the Silverdale store and had them delivered a few days later. I was just going to let it all go and never order from them again, but today I finally got to the point where I was going to be laying out the plywood flooring for my deck, and noticed that it was thinner then it should be. Sure enough, instead of the 23/32 inch plywood that I had ordered and paid for, they had delivered 19/32 inch, so the plywood is 1/8th of an inch thinner then it should be. Between the buggy website, the poor service for the customer care people, and the shoddy and slow fulfillment from the Silverdale store I'd have been better off just renting a U-Haul and getting the stuff myself for about the same price as their delivery charge. Would not recommend ever.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Terrible.,What a disgrace honestly my family got a new kitchen done by them and flooring and our one bathroom. Wow is all I can say and not in a good way. Every day they would bring broken pieces Then have to take them back to get new ones. The paint job they did I think my 9 year old could of done a better job. Nothing was really done completely worst customer service. They would send every day new guys to do the job half of them looked clueless. It is a shame it ended so badly. You could barely open the drawers in the bathroom without hitting the wall. And tonight a piece from above the sink mind you this was a large long solid piece of wood comes crashing down and almost knocks my dad out. Insane. No care about there work whatsoever.,0,1

Jack Burkhalter was the Project Specialist - Exteriors that came to my home and measured, then sold me the fence. Once I discovered I was deceived during the fence project, I later learned about Shannon Winter whom was a District Manager. The supervisor/manager over the Installation Department in the Greenville store was Charlotte. Installation of the fence didn't start until May 2019 and it was extremely hard to get the Installer to come out to start the installation process. Once the fence was completely installed Charlotte called for a survey of the Installer's performance. Charlotte ask if the Installer put concrete around all the post. When I said no just the 3 gates post Charlotte said all post was suppose to have concrete. Shannon Winter said he will send the Installer back out to put concrete around all posts on May 16, 2019. It been nearly 60 days and no concrete because Lowe's want the Installer to come back out and add concrete without paying the Installer for adding the concrete. Now I'm suffering for choosing Lowe's for my fence. I am not satisfied and DO NOT recommend Lowe's for a fence project.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,"Got “new” machine already waranteed to someone else, then no response locally","TERRIBLE! WISH I COULD RATE AS ZERO! NOT GIVEN THAT OPTION, OF COURSE!

So I set the machine up, hooked it up, and had to go (TO ANOTHER BUSINESS BY CHOICE, OF COURSE) get another drain hose because the one that came with was way too short. When I finally got it set up, I tried to run the machine; the agitator only worked at the “gentle” speed, even on HEAVY DUTY or SUPER CLEAN or whatever. On Monday, I called WHIRLPOOL, and, LO AND BEHOLD - THEY LOOKED UP THE SERIAL NUMBER AND IT WAS ALREADY WARANTEED TO SOMEONE ELSE! Called the local store. Manager was going to find out what happened and was going to call me back. DID NOT CALL BACK! Finally, I called the Lowe’ REGIONAL office and arranged to RETURN the machine. NOT EXCHANGE! TOO MUCH ————TO WADE THRU!

He arranged an exchange without even consulting me on whether I WANTED to exchange?!?!

After following all of the manufacturer's instructions in moving and installing it, the fridge has an error code on it. I call LG and it's the compressor fan inside and it has to be repaired by a technician (2 week wait just to get someone to look at it, then they will have to order parts, etc). I call Lowe's about this and talk to an appliance salesperson. Sorry, there's nothing he can do. Really? You failed to mention there are internal problems with the fridge. His response - it was probably my fault and I broke it. I then talk to a manager and get the same responses. Really? I just spent $1500 and that's the customer service I get? They don't care one bit they failed to mention any problems with the fridge and it's my fault. Good thing there's a manufacturers warranty because Lowe's does not care at all.

Lowe's Companies,Disappointing and worrying business practices,"Imagine you own a home, imagine you want to upgrade/update your windows and doors, imagine Lowe’s enters the picture…Now imagine a salesperson -from the Paterson Lowe’s-; kind, courteous, follows up, is polite about spending hours with you during the selection and approval process. Comes in the evenings making it oh so easy for you to sign on the dotted line. Promising – in writing- a delivery and installation date 2 weeks after the contract is signed.Now fast-forward 6 months into the future and note the following:1. Windows that were either installed incorrectly or are missing pieces2. Screens that are ripped and/or bent3. A front door which -after much ado- was returned but never properly refunded4. A lifetime guarantee which clearly nobody takes seriously and exists in promise only5. A company which -even after trying to resolve issues with much patience and follow-up on the client’s side – doesn’t care.Unfortunately we live in a world where a company who has been lacking basic communication skills can survive, where a customer’s complaints and attempts at securing what the signed contract called for– a promise to the client- can not only be not kept but the customer also penalized for attempting to resolve the issue. I am left paying for a job half-done with no avenue for recourse.How is that OK?",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Online Payment = Joke,"Lowe's likely won't see this nor action against it as it's a 3rd party set-up. But for kicks and giggles, I won't understand this logic. Had a promotional purchase tied to my Lowe's card. Also had a one-off monthly purchase that was put on the card separate from the promotional offer. My goal was to pay the amount owed for the non-promo (one billing cycle). Simple as that. Called the customer service number, was told to physically go to the store and pay at the register. Was told they'd provide me the balances onsite so I knew what to contribute to the non-promo portion. Was not told anything related to acceptable forms of payment and/or restrictions. The register couldn't pull up the account. The manager couldn't pull up the account. I made up a number (estimated) and got my credit card out to make a blanket payment towards my card balance. They don't accept credit cards. They wanted me to link a debit card to the account, asking for checking/routing information. I obviously don't keep those digits on me; who does? So not only was the phone rep incorrect, the onsite stores also couldn't pull up an invoice that they technically own and manage. How is that normal? As for not being able to pay with a credit card...not too sure why you'd accept that payment for one-off purchases and not balances. Lowe's payment set-up is a joke. Their people aren't trained and they are not aligned. We'll be cancelling our account, guess we're Home Depot people now.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,I went to the Lowe's store in Tigard,"I went to the Lowe's store in Tigard, OR to rent a carpet cleaner and learned in person about their notorious customer services.1. after entering the store, I was looking for a rental sign, since I was so used to the styles in Home Depot. Browsing for a while and could not find any, then I asked a customer service guy where can I rent a carpet cleaner, the guy pointed to his back direction and said ""in front"". Then I went out store and looked around the front of the store, and asked a few store staffs, but surprisingly, no one knew where Lowe's rental is. A guy recommended me to check customer services. Then, I came back and asked the same guy again, where is the carpet cleaner rental. The guy told me, I just told you in front. Actually he meant at his back there are a couple of carpet cleaners on the shelf, and he is one of customer services staffs who is exactly covering rental as well. Am I too stupid to understand what ""in front"" really means? or he is not willing to cover what he is supposed to do? 2. We told a lady in the customer services counter we would like to rent a carpet cleaner, she replied simply ""take one from the shelf, $29.99 a day"" without even looking at us. Then we both lifted a heavy machine from the shelf ourselves (we both are ~65 and taking a heavy machine from the shelf is not so easy for us). 3. Looking at the 5-6 choices of washing chemicals on the shelf, we asked her which type of chemical may fit our need for the carpet not very dirty in 1700 sqft in a 4 bedroom house. She impatiently replied any of them is fine. Then we have to look at the illustrations line by line, and picked up one in a big bottle since we don't want to come back again just for chemicals. It turned the one we bought is able to cover 4000 sqft or 40 rooms. 4. We then asked how to use it, could you show us the steps?She pointed to the machine told us, the instructions are on the machine, check out yourselves. 5. after we took the machine back home and started to clean our carpet, we suddenly realized they did not give us the hose and small head to clean stairs and corners. Then we called customer services, they said $5 for hose, oh my god why didn't let us know earlier we already been away from the store about 30 miles. We said we would like to rent. They said we only have one hose, first in first out, no reservation. We are surprised at Lowe's shrewd business sense, they claimed 24 hour rental at $20, but since most people would need a hose and small head, then they end up renting the machine+hose at $35 while Home Depot rent everything together at $33.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Mixed Experience,"I am taking this opportunity to share my recent experience with the purchase of major appliances, washing machine and electric dryer from Lowe’s. Reflecting on A Tale of Two Cities, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”Lowe’s has a very extensive selection of major appliances, basically all the major brands and the pricing structure is either equal to prevailing market sector competitors or at a saving through a sale and/or promotion. A visit to my local store, Bensalem, PA provided us a comprehensive inventory for inspection and selection. The sales associate was knowledgeable and helpful in narrowing down based on our needs and criteria on technology. We were advised that the delivery would include installation through a 3rd party vendor and that Lowe’s discounted appliance parts with the major appliance parts. I advised that my washing machine hoses were bought at this store and was less than two months old. EASTMAN 2-Pack 6-ft L 3/4-in Hose Thread Inlet x 3/4-in Hose Thread Outlet Stainless Steel Washing Machine Connector (Model # 98506). There was no indication that this would be and subsequent install issue. I purchased a new Utilitech 3-Prong Gray Dryer Appliance Power Cord (Model # UTD100306) for the electric dryer and advised I have a zero clearance issue and am using a Lambro 24-in to 41-in Adjustable Periscope Dryer Vent (Model # L3006) previously purchased at this store and visual inspection indicates it is in perfect condition. Again I was not advised the 3rd party vendor would not install the electric dryer without the purchase of a new dryer vent.The appliances were purchased on 5/30/2019 with delivery scheduled on 6/3/2019. Today has been a major consumer snafu with the delivery hassle, failure to install, unsuccessful telephone conversations with the 3rd party delivery service and a return trip back to the local store seeking a resolution, short of returning the appliances.The delivery persons inspected the install location and immediately took exception with the dryer vent, despite inspection that it was clean in perfect working order. The next issue was with the relatively new stainless steel hoses. I even showed him the previous SS hoses sitting on my work bench. Not acceptable based on his instructions and contact with the delivery service office. He then indicated I needed another part, a Lambro 4-in Dia Aluminum Dryer Vent Extender (Model # L5003), because of the dryer offset on the back. I offered to drive over the local store and get the piece 10-15 minutes. Not acceptable because I wanted to use the existing dryer vent.Recognizing, I was unable to reason with delivery an interim request was made to install the electrical wire and reverse the door panel from left to right: to right to left. I would go to Lowe’s secure vent extender and complete the hook up. Again this was totally unacceptable to the 3rd party delivery service. Similarly I requested that they attach the drain hose to the washer and I would screw on the hoses. Again this was not acceptable. They started to “throw” the appliances back into the truck despite at least a dozen times my request to bring them into the house. Only after a major confrontation the appliances were brought into the house without installation.This is a WARNING to any potential customers that are contemplating a major appliance purchase. I found Lowe’s to have an excellent selection of products, knowledgeable sales associates, and very competitive pricing. But the delivery/install service is GROSSLY flawed. A review of the Internet reveals ongoing issues with Lowe’s 3rd party service. The reality is that Lowe’s has to find a new delivery/install service to remain viable in a competitive big box market place.Potential buyers should be aware of Appliance Delivery, Installation and Haul Away and the restrictions imposed on the “free service” check the web site for complete detail and restrictions, store should have copy for buyers. Common sense does not come into play, throwing away effective items, and incurring additional costs to satisfy the 3rd party delivery/installation insurable risk concerns. These add on cost is part of the purchase price when comparative shopping. Even more interesting is the 3rd party vendor’s position the parts must be in an unopened packaging to be considered new.How this is resolved remaining to be determined.Resolution - Status UpdateSince this initial “surprise”, I have checked other retail big box sellers and the same restrictions appear to be in effect. Accepting this limitation, buyers should be completely informed of this and can plan for the additional cost and do not open any connecting items.However, I did not find this similar restriction with two local stores on delivery installation. It was strongly suggested to have new hoses, dryer power cord and non-plastic venting. Perhaps my situation was unique because I had recently replaced the various components from Lowes when remodeling the laundry room and to rebuy made no sense.I went back to my local Lowes and found them willing to work with me. Again the issue is with the delivery/install process, outside service. Lowes gave me the needed 4” extender for the dryer and I declined the zero clearance venting. I went home installed the power cord, reversed the dryer door and inserted the vent. Unsure if a return call from the delivery/install would be made despite Lowes efforts. Lowes again provided me a new set of hoses for the washer. Identical to the ones installed that was only 2 months old. A follow up call was made by another delivery/install team. They tried to hook up the washer, unsuccessfully. The previous washer was 19 years old, a Whirlpool and used an anti-siphon connection at the stand pipe. The replacement GE would not seal/connect at the standpipe. They recommended a straight replacement standpipe. In discussion they had no awareness of having a trap to prevent sewer gas from entering the home. It was obvious that their knowledge was very limited. Told thanks and terminated the visit. I called a local plumber who successfully addressed the standpipe hook up.",0,4
Lowe's Companies,Total Waste Of My Time And Money,"The only reason I got involved with this horrible company is, I was in need of a generator years ago and they were the only place that had one. I signed up for a credit card and bought the generator. I would go there to purchase my home improvement supplies just because of the card and the store was closest to my house. Every trip was less that pleasant. I would complain about their service to managment but it did no good. I was just one customer to them. I also avoid H.D. Today was the final straw. There are too many alternatives to keep dealing with these clowns. Looks like Tractor Supply will get my $6000 for my new zero turn.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,"the most unreliable, incompetent and rude people ever","if i could i would give less then 1 star. They are TERRIBLE!!!!! worst worst worst services ever. Between the incompetence of their customer service, to the totally careless of the store (the Aramingo store in Philadelphia) to end to their delivery service, where they just deliver at ground floor but they don't tell you until they arrive. I ordered a pergola and a patio set for my rooftop, meant to be delivered on a Thursday all together,it changed at Friday until i received a call from the store (Aramingo) stating that they didn't know when my furniture would be delivered, to note that i travel a lot so i planned accordingly, included taking a day off to receive the furniture. Ended the conversation with this rude lady i called customer service. At that point i spoke with a lady who told me that i would receive the pergola that Thursday and the patio furniture the next day.She also sent me the tracking number (very funny the store didn't have any information). I was very surprised since i did a truck delivery that actually was fedex but after confirming with this lady multiple time that i would have received a call prior the delivery and that everything was arriving at my house i ended the call. Note, i leave in a house so i need to receive the delivery otherwise they could get stolen. After a few hours i received a notification that my patio furniture where delivered, no one called me. SO i had to run from my office and start arguing again with those incompetent people. At the end of a long call, where this person was keeping losing time apologizing (i need solution not apologies) i found out that actually the patio was delivered actually at the store but they couldn't fit me for the delivery on Friday, until after i ask to cancel my order multiple time suddenly they found the spot for me. but is not done yet! my pergola, this guys apparently didn't have any information, well guess what? i did, his colleagues previously gave me all the tracking, and i'm thinking how is that possible? 1 person has it and the other doesn't?can they be so terrible? i had to cancel the order, but once again you think the worst is done? and actually no!!! this morning (the day of the delivery) i received another call from the rude lady at the Aramingo store stating that they don't deliver on the rooftop and she told me if i wanted to have them up on my rooftop i should have carry on everything by myself or cancel the order. So, if a delivery company who does half of the job...interesting...well never never again!!!! no wonder why those company are being destroyed by Amazon. i'm so embarrassed for them and for how bad is they service, go somewhere else if you want a reliable service. and they state Lowe's home improvement, here the only thing i see need to be improved are the services they offer.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes Online Ordering and Delivery System is Flawed.  Don't use it.,"Online Ordering System is Broken. When I placed an on-line order for a small barbecue on May 19th, 2019, I was informed it would be shipped in 1-2 days. After not receiving a shipping confirmation or hearing anything for six days I sent an email to customer support. Received a reply 2 days later saying the store that was to ship it was out of stock but another store further away would send me shipping notice following day. Nothing received, I followed-up again, no reply. Tried calling by phone on May 30th and after 45 minute wait, I had to hang up. I noticed they had a chat button which I tried. I was told chat wait was 15 minutes and from there after 2 minutes I received another 15 minute wait notice. Finally after another 45 minutes a chat person came on line. From there I was able to cancel the order and ask for refund. Received email confirming order cancelled. Now waiting 5-10 days for refund. I will not order anything again from Lowes using their online service. The ordering and delivery system does not work and is unreliable. I learned afterwards that many other people have had similar experiences.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,POOR BUSINESS PRACTICE AND LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY,"I placed an order for a dishwasher online 3 weeks ago. On 5/21/19 I received an email stating that my delivery was scheduled for 5/24/19 with a 12 hour window. I stayed home from work this day. At 1 pm that day I called to check on my delivery and was told that my delivery date had been changed to 5/30/19. I was informed by a Lowe's employee that there was no way to track this change or to inform the customer of delivery information since Lowe's is not affiliated with the delivery company. On 5/30/19 I called to check on delivery. The first person I spoke with told me that I needed to be transferred to the store as she is unable to obtain any information since it was an installation product. I was transferred and hung up on. The second call a person transferred me to the store which I was told they were also unable to determine any information regarding my delivery because it was ordered online. I asked to speak with a manager. He informed me that my delivery was once again re-scheduled, even though I have yet to receive any notification of this change, and it is 1 pm. He was also unable to provide any information regarding the delivery stating that it is an outside company that Lowe's uses for delivery and/or it could be the manufactures' fault. I have never had a worse experience ordering online. This system is flawed, which the manager also agreed however, stated that he is unable inform your executive leaders. I can only hope this email makes it to someone who can fix this. Your company has wasted two of my work days now. I have cancelled my order. Shame on Lowe's for your poor business practice and lack of responsibility.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,!!!ATTENTION!!,"!!!ATTENTION!!! fellow customers, I have been dealing with Lowes for many years and all experiences had been good. I had moved to VA thats when something went HORRIBLY wrong! I had placed a very large order about a year back to be delivered. I had to call over 25 times for them to correct their own errors. They ended up not delivering all the items I called I fought they gave me free delivery and 10% off (FYI after fighting for a few more days, I decided they won, The 10% had covered the missing items even though I did not actually receive a discount on my order)! That brings us to I placed another large order to be deviled on May 18th. I was reassured over and over it would be delivered on the 20-21st. Even though I had to call 3 times because they changed thing to pick up including 33 cinder blocks out of the 88 I guess hoping my minivan could carry them lol. I recd my first order the right day. The other 2 trucks no show. After 5 more calls one store said its to far and made shore the store closer to me had the units which they did switched it in system and had a delivery date of yesterday. I am having a large party tomorrow one of the reasons for a new grill! After another no show yesterday and 2 calls last night. I was told I would recd a call this AM...Guess what No call!! I called Lowes customer service twice again. I finally said enough spoke to a supervisor who was nice to listen to my horror story with this order and called a closer store who then found out noone in 100 miles from me has this grill. He called me back excited to tell me that they could work in my time frame and deliver a substandard on less money bad review and smaller to me by the am. WHAT THE HECK is that.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes Online Order service is seriously…,"Lowes Online Order service is seriously lacking and should be scrapped. On Saturday I was working on several projects and decided to give Spokane Lowes on Sprague one more try to see if they could get my order done in a timely manner while I continued working. I have tried a couple times in the past and they dropped the ball each time. Three hours later with no notification concerning my order, I called the service desk, was put on hold twice for about 5 minutes, and was finally told the person who handled internet orders doesn't work weekends! I was shocked given the fact that most people get things accomplished during this time period. She told me someone would START pulling the orders soon and get back to me. Needless to say the rest of that day was shot due to the lack of materials I was waiting for. A day later and still nothing. My plan is to go into the store, cancel the $600+ order and go across the street to Home Depot. I find it to be quite pathetic that a large corporation like Lowes fails to recognize the negative consequences for assigning internet order employees only during the WORK week. My fun meter with Lowes has pegged and I'll be sticking with Home Depot.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Dishonored Warranty,"I purchased a Frigidaire refrigerator, LGHT2046QF, and the 3-yr extended warranty for a total price of $1147.03, July 2016 at Lowe's, Davenport IA. It ran fine for the first 2 1/2 years, but then required repeated manual defrosting due to icing in the freezer that caused the lower fridge to get warm- every 2 weeks at first, then every 2 days, and then came the chemical odor, weak at first, then reeked so bad I had to scoot it outside and dispose dispose all the food (about $400 worth). My poor spaniel had vomited and couldn't breathe. I was nauseous, had a headache, sore throat and lungs, and my son has been sick with sinus congestion as well. My taste buds are still not right. Repairmen had serviced it twice prior to the leakage detection, but only made minor adjustments and defrosted the freezer. My 3 year extended warranty expires this July and Lowe's has refused to honor the warranty at this point because the fridge was placed next to the stove (same spot prior fridges sat since the 1950s, none of which died before 3 years). When Lowe's accepted my payment for this purchase, they did not advise me that their warranty would not be honored if the fridge was placed next to a stove, nor did the deliverymen advise me the warranty would not be honored when THEY PLACED IT NEXT TO MY STOVE. I have since been told by salesmen at other stores that placing a fridge next to a stove is not a problem.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Kitchen remodel,"My elderly parents purchased kitchen cabinets and appliances with Lowe's in Gilbert, Arizona, Store #1090. The kitchen install date was January 9th, 2019. To date, May 7, 2019 the kitchen is not complete.Not only have my parent's emails and phone calls been ignored, they have been lied to, over-charged, and have received the worst customer service I have ever witnessed or experienced. They were charged over $500 to install a microwave which sits on a shelf. When their hood vent was installed it wasn't working and the installer said someone else would repair it. This never happened so my parents hired their own electrician to fix the wiring the installer screwed up. They are still missing an upper cabinet (the wrong one was ordered), pantry shelves, crown molding, toe kicks, trim, and island pedestals. They have had their dishes and food items on a bookshelf for four months.When I finally had enough of the mistreatment I contacted the store manager, Mark Madison on Friday, May 3rd. Mark was condescending, defensive, unapologetic and had the audacity to blame my 77-year old father for signing off on papers before the job was done. Why would the installers present papers if they knew the job was not complete? It shows a lack of integrity. Mark said he would look into the situation and contact my father on Monday, May 6th. He never called. Even after knowing how upset I was over the way my parents have been treated he did not have the decency to keep his promise and contact them. Apparently the store's follow through and customer service is an issue from the top down.Get your kitchen remodel done elsewhere. Lowe's does not care nor deserve your business.",0,1

He could not have cared less about a customer purchasing a couple thousand dollars worth of items. This poor customer service is why businesses continue to fail. An internet sale would have been more satisfying than dealing with the Lowes off Midlothian in Chesterfield Va. Yes, I canceled my order I will not pay for this type of service.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Terrible Service,"Hello, I would like to share my annoyance and disappointment with my dealings with the local Lowes. I bought a samsung dishwasher and installed it myself. It worked great for 3 months but then dishes were left dirty in the top rack, it seemed to be throwing the dirty water around and leaving food in tall glasses especially. I called samsung to try and use the warranty but apparently because I installed it, this makes it so you could not use the warranty, which Lowes did not mention at all during the purchase!! Called samsung again and apparently, I need to get a lowes worker to come and sign off on the instillation which they want around 180$ for this...ridiculous as this should be a very fast process. But whatever gave in and set up appointment and paid the fee. My father disconnected the dishwasher to take a look while we were waiting as well. Well today was the day of the appointment and they dont even show up. I had to get someone to actually sit at my home 12-5 today as I work, and no one shows up, not even a call. I called lowes around 5 and did not even get a real apology, just we dont know what happend you will be called a different day to reschedule goodbye. I felt the worker was very short brief and a little rude. So now I still have a unhooked dishwasher, and have to wait for an entirely new appointment to be made and get someone to be at the house again for this. This whole experience has been a waste of time and I will not be recommending this location in the future.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes mower. Don’t do it!,"I originally went to Lowe’s on Jordan Creek Parkway on Sunday in Des Moines, IA to buy a mower we have been researching for a couple weeks. They were out of the 52 inch Ariens that we wanted so that sales associate told us to go to the Lowe’s on 50th St. in Des Moines IA. He said they have them in stock there. We arrive at the 50th St. Lowe’s after waiting almost 30 minutes to even find someone in the mowers area we get Willie. I had a couple questions about the Lowes card but since we already knew what mower we were getting, he looked it up and said they had two in stock and asked if we needed it today? We said yes. He said multiple times,that’s no problem he can go back and assemble it. We checked out, and then Willie says come back a little before 6 PM to pick it up, on our way back to the store Willie calls and says that he wasn’t able to get the mower assembled. I said you told me multiple times that you would have it done today, we are now three minutes away from the store with our truck and trailer for the second time today. He said I’ll see what I can do. We get to the store, I walk in and find Willie walking around straightening shelves. He wasn’t in the back assembling it. He never even tried to get it assembled. I ask him if we can just take it and assemble it ourselves. He said no, it has to be uncrated and inspected first. I said OK then when can you have it done? He said Wednesday. WEDNESDAY?!?! Why on earth would you tell a customer multiple times you will have it done today, when now you are now saying three days later? At this point I am beyond frustrated and I walk up to customer service and ask to talk to Willie’s manager. I tell him the whole issue with Willie. He says he will have it rushed and have one of his guys put it together tomorrow and we can pick it up after 4 PM. I arrive the next day with our truck and trailer, again. The lady who helped us in the mower department I think her name was Jackie, she was very helpful. At first they can’t find our mower. They say it’s not assembled. I tell her the whole story that happened yesterday. She looks up the mower. They put it under the wrong name. Go figure! She then has to call another manager over to now “steal” it from this customer. What a mess! I would NOT recommend buying a mower from Lowes ever! It was a disaster that just kept getting worse.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Don’t get a fence from Lowe’s,"My story started in July when I ordered a fence. However, eight months later, the story is still going on. Everyone blames someone else, and each person claims it is isn't their fault. (Hello, you all work for Lowe's, step up and take responsibility.) First, they no show on day one. When they do make it out, they ignore the survey we paid for and provided, and the stakes in the ground, and proceed to install an entire side in my neighbors yard. (I should mention I have 2 acres and they were staked with bright pink ribbon.) They also didn't connect the other side to the house, ignoring the drawing of the job in the file. It took hours and hours of phone calls to even get in touch with someone. I started leaving voicemails that said what call I was on. ""This is the 9th day in a row I have left a message, please call me back."" Each time I tried a different number, they couldn't help, and directed me back to the same number I had been calling. The store said there were notes not to talk to us, and that our sales guy had left Lowe's. When I finally spoke to someone, I was told that it was my fault for not providing a survey or job drawing, and for not returning the installers calls. (I seriously thought they were kidding.) Two weeks later, the store manager came out with the installer. Again, we were accused of not proving the survey. My husband called out the installer and he admitted he had left it in the car. Although, that doesn't explain ignoring the staked yard. A few hundred phone calls and emails later and were were told they would correct it. A few months and many, many more phone calls and emails and some of the work gets done. But, the fence is still incomplete. I cannot tell you home much time I have put into it at this point, but I could have done the whole damn fence myself twice by now. More of my time and more waiting, now promises of compensation are added to the promise of completion. Then, wait for it.... I am told, ""Lowe's cannot find an installer to complete the installation."" I'm floored (although I shouldn't be by this point). I am promised even more compensation. But, I didn't sign up to finish it myself. Many more phone calls and someone gives me a new number. FINALLY!!! She's nice, and actually gets things done. But, doesn't fully understand just how terrible this has been. She again blames others that have left Lowe's, informs me that if I complete any of the work myself the entire warranty is void. (Nice of the last guy to forget to mention this.) Work gets completed, but still isn't what the drawing in the file shows. I give up and just want this over. I agree the work is done and ask about compensation. What they offer doesn't come near to compensating me for my time, let alone help me mend bridges with the neighbor who probably hates me for messing up his yard. Lowe's you need to make this right.",0,1

He received a verification promise on the phone that it's still coming April 12th in the morning. By 12:30 that day we got to call them because nothing was here yet.

I was not ready to pay the current balance. Now, it takes up to 10 business days to get the money back, while there is an investigation going on. Manager Tom from Lowe's credit hung up on me.

Lowe's Companies,BEWARE! THIS IS A SCAM JOB BY LOWE’S!!!,"First and foremost, Lowe’s did not provide us with the correct information when we inquired about sink installation. They should have told us that the process will take about a month since they outsource the appointment. After paying $40.00, an 800 number calls me to set up an appointment for the contractor to give me an estimate on the cost of the sink installation. I had requested them to come in the afternoon. The girl said, we will try. Then she proceeded to say they will call me to give me a window of time when the contractor is going to show up at my house. I never received such call. The contractor called me 10 minutes before he arrived. When he arrived, I told him that I need the sink disconnected first. He said that needs to be scheduled with Lowe’s after he provides us with a quote. I also mentioned that the sink needs to be installed on Monday afternoon. He informed me that they don’t work on Mondays. Lowe’s never told us this otherwise I wouldn’t have gone with them. The contractor cannot give us a quote. He said Lowe’s will call us and give us a quote. 2 days after the contractor showed up at our house I received a call from Lowe’s informing us that the installation of the farmhouse sink will cost me $1606.00. They are out of their mind. The sink doesn’t even cost half of that. She said that the contractor had to build a support and it will take about 8 hours to complete the job. I told her that he doesn’t know how to install a farmhouse sink. So he’s using my sink as a guinea pig? I don’t think so. She proceeded to say, I will lose my $40.00 deposit if I don’t do it.SERIOUSLY LOWE’S? I will never go to Lowe’s for installation of anything anymore. I would rather go to Home Depot. At least they will charge a flat fee and they know what they are doing. I wish I didn’t have to give LOWE’S any stars at all. This is an easy way of Lowe’s to get their customers to pay $40.00 for a job they know their contractors cannot even do. WHAT A SCAM!!! Before you buy anything at Lowe’s, think about the headache that I had to go through because of Lowe’s incompetency on scheduling contractors, choosing contractors and failed to provide their customers with the proper information.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I went to Lowe's store #0246 in…,"I went to Lowe's store #0246 in Northglenn Colorado and I couldn't be happier. It was for such a simple thing. The screw on my license plate would not come off, because the people who sold me the car jammed the screw in so tight, I couldn't even unscrew it with an electric drill. So I went into Lowe's and in came Tim. He went above and beyond. Normally, with good customer service, the employees would help answer your questions correctly and help you find what you're looking for. But with excellent customer service, you get Tim, who not only answered my questions, but went out of his way to make sure my problem was resolve after leaving the store. I couldn't get over the wonderful experience. Lowe's is now my go-to store for any hardware issues I might have in the future, and I would definitely come back to this store!",0,5

While standing in the store, 3 near by associates where two busy to acknowledge me or ask if I needed help, a 4th walked by not even asking if I needed help. I believe in shopping local, and understand when its super busy. Today there were more associates in the store than customers. I left the area and went to the other side of the store to pick up other needed items. I returned about 10 minutes later. 1 girl hiding on her cell phone wouldn't look up, i moved to other side of 2K tractor in full view, she walked away. 2 others still too busy to help, I left after several minutes. At the counter associate asked if I found everything OK. Everything but someone to sell me a tractor, thats the manager want me to go get him? Nope too late for that.Now I return home and Email the CEO with my complaint and my phone rang off the hook from the store. The manager wanted to know what she had to do to get me back in the store. After several phone calls and thinking about what she was offering I called the store back. This time a male manager stated she was gone for the day. I told him who I was and gave my number to have the manager I was working with call me back.Well a week later no calls, no nothing, Lowe's poor customer service has driven yet another customer away. Think before you spend your hard earned money with people who don't care enough when you are in the store, or the managers cannot do a simple task of passing your info and needs onto a fellow employee/manager",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Spoiler Alert…Lowes will go out of business soon!,"The downfall of Lowes is amazing! This box store was once the model of efficiency. Orders were correct, the staff was knowledgeable, timing was impeccable and the product was a good value. They are now in a downward spiral plagued with incompetency, guess work and unaccountability. My story starts on Wednesday, March 13, 2019 with the purchase on a Samsung front loader washer with pedestal to replace a 10 year old similar Samsung that was not economically worth the repair. The new order was set for delivery on Saturday, March 23rd. On Thursday, March 21st I receive a call from XPO, the third party delivery service, stating my delivery was scheduled for March 22nd between 12 noon to 4:00 pm. Great, I am getting my washer a day ahead of time! Wrong! XPO shows up at 4:30 pm to tell me the washer is fine, the pedestal is damaged and the new hot & cold water hoses are not on the truck. The driver recommended I refuse the entire delivery and I should call the store to reschedule the delivery for Saturday. When I called the store they immediately became defensive. They began arguing with me that the pedestal could not have been damaged because it was inspected before being loaded on the truck and I must have taken the hoses with me at the time of purchase. I asked the Lowes rep to think about what he was saying. I just spent over $1,000.00 on a washer and I am trying to beat Lowes on a $29.98 item. Miraculously, he found the paperwork where XPO were to deliver the hoses too. Now, I am rescheduled for last delivery of the day on Saturday since the XPO schedule for Saturday was already set and I am a courtesy add on. No one shows on Saturday even though I called the store around 4:00 pm to check on deliveries and I was reassured XPO will be at my home before 8:00 pm. No one showed and I did not receive a courtesy call informing me the delivery won’t be made. Okay, I am insane…this exact scenario plays out again on Sunday! Of course there are reassurances from the store manager my order is on the way, but once again XPO is a no show. Lowes has ruined my entire weekend! Additionally, the store manager promises a $200.00 refund to my purchase for all the inconvenience surrounding this delivery. As of this writing, nothing has been refunded. On Monday morning March 25th having heard nothing from Lowes I call for a status. According to their records the order was delivered on Saturday and they were waiting for the paperwork from XPO. After some back and forth, they ""found"" the paperwork and agreed the washer was not delivered and a new delivery is scheduled for Tuesday, March 26th. XPO calls Monday evening with the delivery window between 12 noon to 4:00 pm. They show up on time on Tuesday...yippee! However, they have the same broken pedestal for delivery! The driver in this case recommends two things: he leaves the Samsung washer in my garage; and Lowes should put a rush order for a new pedestal and hoses. Another call to Lowes and another round of frustration! Finally, I did receive a call from Lowes that they would loan me a top loader washer until the Samsung installation could be completed. Apparently, they ran out of pedestals. At this point, I am on the list for the last delivery on Wednesday, 27th for a loaner washer. Well, they show up around 8:30 am because the driver was told to make me one of the first deliveries of the day. More communications breakdown between Lowes and XPO. So, where do I stand? A new Samsung washer is in my garage, a Roper top loader loaner washer is in my laundry room, no $200.00 refund for my inconvenience yet, and absolutely no idea where we stand with backorder of the pedestal!

Furniture is great except the sunbrella cushions deteriorated in only a year and half. I took the cushions to Lowes in Carefree AZ where I purchased them and the rude customer service lady told me they are only warranted for 90 days. When another customer service lady joined the conversation, she corrected the women in that the cushions are warranted for 2 years. They asked for a receipt which of course i did not have (who keeps a receipt for a year and half?) but asked to look it up by card number. They found the invoice # and a phone number to call. I made the call this am and after a 45 min conversation and hold time they informed me that they cannot not find my receipt cause it was purchased with a debit card even though they could see i purchased the products from the invoice #!. Told me if i used a CC they could find it but apparently they don't keep records of a debit card purchase, WTH? . BRUTAL! I paid almost 2K for all of the furniture and they cannot even stand behind the return policy on the warranted cushions. They have proof i purchased but not good enough apparently. Worst customer service i have ever experienced and WILL not shop at Lowe's ever again. I don't believe i would have had this experience at Home Depot. So basically they are telling me your SOL! Enjoy your crappy two thousand dollar furniture. I expected a much better experience from Lowe's. Extremely disappointed. I will post images of the cushions when I get home tonight.

Lowe's Companies,Terrible delivery experience,"Terrible, terrible customer service. I purchased a $5000 double wall oven online on March 6th and was issued a delivery date of March 22 (today) between 9a and 9p. The confirmation email I received directed me to my local store with questions, as they would be fulfilling the delivery. I called the store yesterday to see if I could get a better idea of the delivery time. I was told only that I would be getting a call this morning that would give me a two-hour delivery window. At 10:00 this morning, I received what looks like an automated email that says ""there has been a change to your order."" I had to read through all the fine print to see that the delivery date was changed by two weeks. I call my local store to talk to someone in the delivery department, and he transfers me to someone in ""pickups"" because they deal with orders that were placed online. He just says that the item isn't in, so they can't deliver it, and then he transfers me back to the delivery department, who tells me to call their corporate customer service. I call that number and explain that my husband took the day off work and I have an electrician and a cabinetmaker waiting at my house for the delivery that is now not going to happen. She insists that there was no way to notify me any sooner about the delivery delay, because they let me know as soon as Lowe's received notification from the manufacturer. There is no way that can be true. The delivery team doesn't look the night before to make sure they have the product before they set up their delivery route? That is not believable. If I had just one day's notice about the change in delivery date, I could have saved a lot of people a lot of inconvenience. Throughout my communications with various customer service reps for Lowe's, I was told that the communication problem was a result of my having ordered the wall ovens online rather than coming into the store. I did not realize I was signing up for a sub-par customer service experience by shopping online - that should be better explained on the website. Also, no one has offered to compensate me for the service call fees that I wasted by having the contractors on-site for the delivery that was canceled at the last minute.

They seem eager to resolve our ice maker issue in our 3 year old fridge (not making ice) but the problem is, they contract out to L Electronics In Arlington Heights, Illinois and there are no other companies in the entire Chicagoland that is a Lowe’s approved contractor. L Electronics installed a brand new ice maker 5 day ago. Since then it has not dispensed one ice cube. The tech came back, and with his limited English, explained that there is nothing wrong with it. He just doesn’t know why it’s not dispensing the ice that is being made in the tray. I don’t get it. If the ice maker is making ice, but not dispensing it in the bin, then it’s not working. The tech left the second time indicating in his notes that all was normal. Do not use this company unless you’re willing to get frustrated beyond belief. How many bad reviews have to be written before Lowe’s contracts someone else to service their protection plans. It would be nice if Lowes would step up, realize that L Electronics is not making the cut, and establish relationships with other appliance repair firms that are capable of diagnosing and making repairs instead of just leaving the customer hanging. I will never use L or Lowe’s again",0,1

Then, a month later, issues with subcontractor for window treatments. Took 3 days to schedule an appointment for measurements, then appt was canceled less than an hour before they were to be there. Had to reschedule. Late for 2nd appointment. After 7 days, still hadn't provide measurements to Lowe's. I had to go back to store, and start all over with Window dept. Canceled the subcontractor installation, did get a refund, and husband installed all eleven shades in under 2 hours. Third strike came from Flooring Dept. Ordered carpet for 2 bedrooms, and it didn't show up on delivery date. After a couple calls and an email, I was finally told that the production date had been changed by the Vendor, but nobody notified me. Of course, they are blaming the Vendor, but I had just emailed with the sales person only a few days before to confirm we were still on track, which she confirmed. Apparently nobody actually checked. Couldn't wait for the new production date because our move in date had already been coordinated with others. Canceled the carpet order and was able to get a full refund.

I purchased some sun shades (triangular material with tie downs) that were marked down but didn't realize until I got home that they charged me full price. I called the store and a very friendly lady told me no problem just bring in the receipt and they would refund me the difference. When I went in the next day I stood at the customer service counter with two other people and listened to the three employees behind the counter argue over which one was going to serve the older gentleman who I assume was there first. Finally one guy says in an overly dramatic voice ""fine I'll do it"" and proceeded to loudly and agressively demand to know what the guy wanted. The other two employees then decided to see what the other guy ahead of me wanted. Then came my turn and when I explained the issue the young fellow said ok and was about to scan my receipt for the refund. But, just then the loud and dramatic moron said not so fast. He had to verify the item was really on sale. I pointed to the rack about 15 feet away and told him to look at the sign clearly visible on it. That wasn't good enough, he had to make a huge show about going to the rack and examining it in great detail and with much flare all after the fact the first guy had looked up the number and agreed it was indeed on sale. Turns out the bone head was the ""manager"" (maybe he embelished that because he was to stupid and lazy to actually be a manager of anything more complicated than a scrub bucket) and wouldn't trust his employee. When I suggested he was a moron he got even more belligerant and told me he didn't have to hear that kind of talk in ""his"" store. Needless to say, I got my refund and have not set foot in any Lowes store since. I will never again shop there.

I'm retired military and it's soooooo much easier getting a discount at lowes than home depot. Both stores sale the same things except for their off brand stuff. Lowes seems to have better quality with their Lowes brand items. Slight difference in pricing, I find the price at lowes seems to be a tad bit lower. The associates try to help, in my experience if they don't know they just tell me... Sorry I can't help with that, I just don't know. All in all I like lowes and it has become my go to store.",0,4
Lowe's Companies,I've done over 20000 dollars worth of…,I've done over 20000 dollars worth of business at lowes last year never been late on a payment and have always paid my card off. Started a business and had to use all my credit cards took a while to get paid for the job but paid all my cards back off. Just got a letter saying my card was cancelled. I'm looking at 50 to 80 thousand to spend this year I guess menards is gonna be happy.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Horrible,Horrible! Ordered a fridge and was told it would be in 1 week from the day ordered. I was called the next day and told it would be a month. I was okay with this. The next week I get a call that it is in and I need to schedule delivery. That would be great other then a store the size of Lowe’s couldn’t give me a delivery window. Not even a before lunch. I’m still waiting for a day I have no other obligation s to have my fridge delivered.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowe's acts as if they do not own IRIS.

They are not supporting product. less than a year and cant take this equipment back to store. They don't credit labor for install. So now I have to install another system and buy it. I am going to install Ring from Home Depot this time.Called number to send old equipment back. No answer so I left a message. Lowe's has shut down stores because their customer service stinks. I am a contractor and am going to cancel my Lowe's card.,0,1
Lowe's Companies,customer service.,"I went to the Wooster, Oh store on Sat. 2/16/19 to purchase some electrical wiring to wire up an outlet. The customer service person was an elderly gentleman named Aubrey. He was very kind and helpful, and by the way, he was the only floor employee that even offered to help me. unfortunately, Lowes does not carry very small amounts of this item. Your company needs to realize that not every customer is going to rewire their whole house and need to think about the do it yourselfer.",0,5
Lowe's Companies,Prices are getting unreasonably high…,"Prices are getting unreasonably high for lumber, etc. and quality is decreasing. Lowes is only for those that don't have an idea about quality/price. I spent more than $20,000 on materials before learning that Lowes has a Vertan's discount. Ouch! Also, Lowes stores are not equal in how they do their business. What works at one store doesn't work at another.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,Bought a Weber Gas Grill Genesis II in…,"Bought a Weber Gas Grill Genesis II in the summer of 2018 at the Lowes Noblesville Indiana store. Before I purchased the gas grill, I asked the salesperson that I was installing a natural gas line to my home and needed the grill able to be converted. Well, the salesperson then sold me a converter kit. So I purchased the Weber Genesis II gas grill with the knowing that it can be converted to natural gas. Now, this was a floor display model. That shouldn't make a difference. Had natural gas installed in my home and then attempted to convert my Weber Gas Grill Genesis II. After the attempting to convert the grill, none of the tools in the conversion kit are not working. So I went back to the Lowes store in Noblesville In. and asked why the conversion kit isn't working, they stated to me, that the Weber Genesis II gas grill can't be converted. Why was I told that I could convert this unit to natural gas and now I can't. Either the salesman had no idea, or maybe the salesman wasn't trained to sell Weber Grills, Or maybe the salesman lied to make the sale. Not sure, but I'm out of a lot of my hard earned money that I spent on this grill that I can't use the way I intended too. At this time Lowe's doesn't want to help out. Guessing I can start doing all my shopping at Menard's and Home depot. Closing my commercial account as well. Terrible customer service...",0,1
Lowe's Companies,THUMBS DOWN FOR LOWE'S AND MAJOR RETAILERS,"Online I see they have some plants that I want, but I haven't seen them in the local store. I called the number they listed, but it was not for the nursery but the general store number.I went through at least 3 recitations of lists of choices, none being lawn and garden or nursery. At the very end of the LAST list came nursery. I chose it! Ha! I was sent back to the first recording about store hours and location, etc. , so I hung up.Hard to believe, but I read here that many have had similar experiences. Companies don't hire PEOPLE anymore. I once walked the entire right side of Home Depot to find an employee. I finally had to go to the service desk. It's exactly the same at Lowe's. Pretty soon robots will be roaming the aisles. Also, I resent being an unpaid employee of these retailers - as well as Michael's, Macys, Bed, Bath, etc. WE have to do the work of non-existent employees.",0,1

Eventually, I was forced to fire this Lowes after they refused to listen, coordinate, and ultimately work the job. You'd think it was the first bathroom floor they'd ever seen as they struggled mightily to overcome such obstacles as: the bid, the materials, toilets, bathtubs, patchwork, molding, and subfloors. I ended up taking over the job myself and knocked it out in 1 day after wasting 4 weeks trying to work with Loews.

Lowe's Companies,Lowe's is losing it with poor customer service,"Calling Lowe's in Norfolk, VA - we could never get anyone to pick up the phone to help with a custom Levelor blind we purchased that was nearly $200 and problems with a custom-made counter top we bought for just under $1000. The phone rings and rings. We've been to the store and seen how those who work in these areas of the store stand around laughing and talking without paying attention to customers who need help. Until, that is, you go up and request help from them.The custom counter top guy who handled our order was offended when I kept asking, ""You're getting this order, right?"" Lo and behold, he got it WRONG. We had to wait three more weeks for the right counter top to be picked up.We've learned that those who work at Lowe's are no longer receiving commission in these big ticket areas of the store. So why would they care if they get custom orders right? They wouldn't.Lowe's used to be an awesome store. Now it's Home Depot with outstanding customer service all the way around.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Johnson and Johnson HVAC,"Johnson and Johnson. We paid Lowe's 17,000 dollars to have 2 new central air and heat pumps installed into our house in 2016. They contracted Johnson And Johnson to do the install. The Upstairs unit have performed perfectly, however the main level unit has malfunctioned from day one. I have complained and after numerous fix it calls after being told from Johnson and Johnson that nothing was wrong or filters were dirty which was never the case because I changed them out every 2 weeks. Which I should never have to change filters that many times in a month. So I contacted Johnson and Johnson again and they stated since my warranty for labor has now expired I would have to pay full for them to come out. I said no because I knew the unit has malfunctioned from day 1.So I have a tenant in the house since December 2017 and he's filed complaints with me that he freezes as the system doesn't work right. So I finally made the decision to contact another HVAC company Shane's Heating and air and Shane came out and stated that Johnson and Johnson installed the air handler 22 inches away from the intake, to correct this they connected the intake to The air handler using an undersized flexible duct, restricting airflow, which causes the unit to shut down and fails to provide heat.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Stay away from Lowes/Kraftmaid,"We ordered Kraftmaid cabinets from Lowes and it was the worst experience ever. Between the two companies that are both non existent when it comes to customer service, it was a challenge to get my kitchen completed in 3 1/2 months. Unless you go to the very top of management, all you can expect is a ""sorry it won't be in for another month"". I went the entire Christmas holiday with half a kitchen because of a kitchen design person that was only capable of ordering cabinets. Both Kraftmaid and Lowes continues to point a finger at each other for the many errors that were made. Errors such as wrong size cabinets and wrong color cabinets. Costly errors as we landed up spending $1,000.00 on a sink, which we drove to another state to pick up, because it was the only one to fit the cabinet size, have you seen how many farmhouse sinks are out there to pick from! Also a peninsula cabinet ordered incorrectly, reordered, that one came in wrong as well. Finally got the so-called correct cabinet only to find our contractor had to modify it for another 3 hours of contractor labor fees. The worst part was the sales associate said after the first cabinet came in wrong that the new one he ordered would fit perfectly. Why was that one not ordered the first time around?? That error cost months of delay, but at least it was fixable by a contractor because at this point I didn't want to deal with Lowes/Kraftmaid anymore. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a better experience.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Lowes Business strategy does not value customers,"Several issues going on. First Lowes shut down their OSH Orchard Supply Hardware chain. 100 stores in California that grew out of silicon valley's true hardware store. Many depended on it for traditional repair parts. Lowes CEO said that ""gee, they did not fit with Lowes vision ( so closed the whold chain). I guess their vision is building materials, not neighborhood hardware. But is is gone and a sad loss to many communities.Then I read the are shutting down their IRIS home automation line of smart products. ""Just didn't seem to catch on"" so now all you folks are now orphans. This style of business is poor practice, and we should remember it",0,1
Lowe's Companies,DO NOT GET MAJOR APPLIANCES FROM…,"DO NOT GET MAJOR APPLIANCES FROM LOWES!!!What a TERRIBLE experience. I ordered a dishwasher from Lowe’s.com.First inconvenience: it took a month to get in!!Second inconvenience: 3 days prior to delivery I get an email saying my delivery window is 8am - 8pm. I guess I don’t have a life? It wasn’t until the morning of the delivery that they called to say they would be arriving within the hour. Third inconvenience: They didn’t offer to take the old dishwasher. The delivery men just said, “sorry, you didn’t pay for it.” Come to find out, after calling customer service, that’s it’s only a $20 charge, and they could have done it. Instead, we had to wait another 3 days for them to come back. Fourth inconvenience: no install. This could very well have been an oversight on my part, but I don’t think the online ordering process warned me about what no install really means. The dishwasher came without a power supply. Obviously, not quite plug and play.Overall: I got the feeling that I paid about $700 for a pile of crap to just be dumped on my doorstep. Now, if I wanted to clean it up I have to wait longer and pay more.I will NEVER order anything online from Lowe’s again, or even think about getting another major appliance from them.

I called Friday and was told it wasn't in call Saturday. I called Saturday and a young lady said she checked and it would be in on Monday. Which was Christmas Eve. I'm stressing but figured I could install it on Monday and it would be great. I call on Monday and still not there. I spoke to the assistant manager and she said it wouldn't be there until Thursday,2 days after my needed date. Corporate couldn't help, Manager couldn't help. So when I went Thursday to pick it up I walked up to the assistant manager and said I should be compensated for all the deceitful answers I got to make a sale knowing I needed it before the holiday and they said in several calls it would be there before it. She said she would give me $20 gift card. I turned to the cashier and said give me my money back. I will never ever ever recommend to anyone to go to Lowe's and I hope they close the doors forever.I actually passed a Home Depot ,Best Buy and a appliance store to go to Lowe's.I wasn't in a hurry since Lowe's missed the date and I ordered a $700 one from Home Depot and received it on the promised date.",0,1

We had to pay 70$ for someone to come out to measure which we understood we would be refunded with our purchase. This process took a month but that was okay. When we met with Gerry on Saturday to finalize our purchase the price was a lot more than we expected. There were dozens of add ons including extra for the moving of ""oversized furniture "". Gerry blamed this completely on the installers but they are paid by Lowe’s so that's not an excuse. None of our furniture is oversized. It's just norma furniture. Every bed and dresser in each room were extra. This was cut out and pasted at the bottom of the proposal which was strange also.",0,1

Sometimes you find an item with the shipping option available, you add it to the cart and this option disappears. About refunds, when you purchase something using gift cards, it's a nightmare. They only send refunds through a merchandise card that can only be shipped to the shipping address, and can only be redeemed in-store. Competitors are already issuing refunds via store credit which you can use online with no problems. Would it be so much trouble if they issued refunds via e-gift cards?

My freshly painted wall in The living room, has a huge scrape on it. The entire wall needs repainted. Not sure what they did to the floors, but they squeak horribly all through the dining room and living room. They did not do this before. I wish I never would have had them install it.

Lowe's Companies,Ordered item on Black Friday online,"Ordered item on Black Friday online. The email receipt states that they will send me other emails on the order/delivery status, this was never done. I called Lowes helpdesk and they stated that it was delivered when it was never received by me. They opened a tracking ticket with FedEx and had me follow up with FedEx on the delivery. I called Fedex and they stated that the package was lost and to call Lowes to start lost package processing. I called Lowes and asked for the item to be reshipped. They said ok and a store manager will call me in 24hrs. That never happened. I call Lowes again and this time they said that they sent the request to the wrong store and that a store manager from the correct store will call me in 24 hrs. Again that never happened.Lowes failures :- email updates on delivery status was never sent- store managers never called- why should I be the one to call FedEx when it wasn't me who contracted with them to deliver the item. Take away :NEVER shop online with Lowes. Go to there competitors instead or even better Amazon as they will make sure everything is right.",0,1

No follow ups, completely not on top of things, not pushing the contractors for project timeline, no communications with me.

Another day or so later, I received an email saying it would be cancelled unless I responded to that email or called. I did both, I received an email confirming I had responded and they would keep the order open. Another couple of days and I received an email telling me they had cancelled the order. I am a very disappointed customer. I do not understand how a company can advertise a product, accept your order and then cancel you. If this is the way Lowe's handles orders.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes and Samsung are the worst to deal with,"In February 2016 we bought online $2000 Samsung refrigerator. Our fridge fail in October 2018 and was diagnosed unrepearable by Samsung sertifaed service and Samsung tech support. We spent many hours with Samsung customer support at trading to get them eventually get us replacement fridge or credit ti get new one. On the end they said we have to provide original recept from the store from where we both it. We really never got recept for our purchase from Lowes. I cooled out Lowes credit card and they give us a copy of statement that said we bought Samsung fridge with date and location but not model and serial number. Guess what Samsung didn't honor this as frog of purchase. I called Lowes and ask for some assistance and all they said was YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT EXTENDED WARRANTY. I posted bad review about the Samsung fridge and they deleted it later because I mentioned Lowes unwillnes for assistance. I'm now done with Samsung and as well with Lowes. Instead of buying new Samsung range and dishwasher from Lowes now I have to buy again new fridge but from Costco, free 4 warranty and if anything happens you call them not the manufacturer.

Lowe's Companies,Will not honor floor warranty,"Lowe's installed a new floor in our home. The floor is defective. We tried for a full year to get Lowe's to make it right, and they simply ignored us. Dozens of emails, phone calls and letters were sent. Lowe's contracts have an arbitration clause forbidding the customer from suing them. When we finally sent an arbitration demand, they ignored that also. In desperation, we did sue them. The judge agreed and sympathized, but ruled that their arbitration clause is enforceable, even if they ignore our demand. People who do business with Lowe's should be aware that if they screw up, you're stuck. All they have to do is ignore you",0,1
Lowe's Companies,LOWES IS A BAD COMPANY TO DO BUSINES WITH,I had a vinyl fence installed through Lowes in Sherville Indiana....

The fence was not installed properly and it's been less than 3 months since the job was completed and the fence has fallen apart.....WHAT A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE !!!!

Lowe's Companies,Do not use Lowe's for installation,"Do not use Lowe's for installation. I am a contractor for 37 years, and, because i am so busy, I ""treated"" myself to having a professional installation of Vinyl flooring in my Kitchen from Loews. Typically, I do it myself because it is impossible to find honesty, integrity and reliable service anymore. I am a dinosaur in my field. The installer had to move my dishwasher out to install the vinyl flooring under it and he seriously screwed up the the door. It is now 2"" off and will not close, He must have know he did this damage, but decided to say nothing. We called Loews the next morning and reported the issue. Three (3 ) weeks later, and they continue to ignore us. Today, they told me I was lying. They insisted that i supply ""Proof"" that the floor installer damaged the dishwasher while taking it in and out for the flooring install. It must have been like this, unusable, all along, for the years i had it, and now, I am blaming the Lowe's floor installer. I bought the dishwasher from Loews just 2 years ago and had it professionally installed. . Unbelievable. Thanksgiving with all our family, and we are now washing all out dishes in the sink, thanks to this dishonest and inept installer. What a miserable company. I would never do this to one of my customers. Do not hire Loews to do any installation for you. They will NOT stand behind their workmanship and they will give you a hard time . The only positive experience has been the local Store manager is pushing Central for restitution. She has no doubt that the damage was indeed done by the floor installer and she wants to make it right. She is determined, frustrated and appalled with how Central is responding to the legitimate complaint.",0,1

The newest date I was given today if it actually shows up (not holding my breath) will put us 3.5 weeks past our original delivery date. The first 2 didn’t happen so only time will tell if this is just another date to push me off for a while. If I had of know this is how Lowe’s treats its customers I would have bought locally.

Lowe's Companies,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING TO BE INSTALLED AT LOWES!!!,"I bought a new refrigerator to replace the one I have that died. I was very specific about everything, even the door opening on the right, an ice maker, and the fact that it was available to be delivered immediately. I spent an entire DAY calling everywhere for this. The refrigerator was ordered and supposed to be delivered TODAY. I spent all morning taking everything out of the refrigerator and freezer. IMPORTANT FACT: The delivery people DO NOT WORK FOR LOWES. The paperwork did not say make sure the door opens from the right....great start, but they did change it. THEN.. ..the water line coming from the wall IS COPPER. Well... they won't TOUCH IT if it's copper. That means..... I have to call a PLUMBER to come and do whatever to the waterline FIRST and then call Lowes to have the delivery people come and finish. UNBELIEVABLE!! Calling Lowes and spoke to the Manager several times and he did NOTHING!! I CALL THAT BAIT AND SWITCH since nothing more than a $12 piece of tubing (which I got) was ever mentioned when I was ordering. Now I have the additional cost of a PLUMBER -- its FRIDAY afternoon now === over and above what Lowes has already been paid! PLUS I have both refrigerators sitting in my kitchen till the plumbing is done since they would not undo the original refrigerator (they don't touch copper, remember). I am so MAD I can't see straight! So my plumber comes later today and detaches the water line from the old refrigerator and attaches the new in less than 10 minutes WITH the tubing I had already purchased from LOWES!! Wow....must be magic, right? I watched my plumber. It's not magic and if I knew what to do I could have done it myself! So...at a charge of $114.30 more I have my new refrigerator running and making ice and the old one sitting here....taking up room. Now I have to call Lowes and make yet ANOTHER appointment for those jerk installers to come out and take the old refrigerator away. I will NEVER buy anything from LOWES ever again! and you shouldn't either. Obviously their customers DO NOT COME FIRST! and THEY COST MORE MONEY BY LIEING!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,NEVER USE LOWE'S FOR RENOVATION,"We went through Lowe's to do a complete bathroom renovation. BIG MISTAKE!!!! 1st off I want to say we only have one bath in our home.The project specialist was not competent in ordering or communicating with the contractor about our products. We ordered a shower surround with glass doors. We picked out shower doors where both panels move and we picked out really nice hardware. First, when our shower was delivered, they delivered the wrong doors then we find out that the project manager messed up our shower door order. We could not get the shower doors with the hardware we originally ordered because they were custom. NOT OUR FAULT!!!! We were told we could get the doors but we would have to pay the extra cost and wait another 6-8 weeks for delivery! We shouldn't have had to pay anything extra because we were told we could get them and they should have either given us temporary doors or put a rush on the custom order. The tile installed on our bathroom floor was installed wrong the project specialist never noted how we wanted the tile installed. The project specialist told us they would fix everything but it would prolong our renovation because they would have to un-install the shower surround and rip up the floors. With only 1 bathroom available to us and our project already taking longer than was originally stated we could prolong it any further. I was told that we could get a refund on the labor for our floor which I though was fair because we did get the product just not installed the way we wanted it. Then I am told that since Lowe's had already paid out the cost of labor they would refund me for the product. Not my problem they paid out the cost of labor it was their fault the floor didn't get installed properly and I didn't get the doors I was told I could get.I WILL NEVER USE LOWE'S AGAIN FOR ANY TYPE OF RENOVATION!!!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Absolutely the worst experience you can…,"Absolutely the worst experience you can ever imagine. We purchased 30 windows for our home and contracted with Lowe’s to have them installed by one of their subcontractors White Glove. The windows were installed incorrectly which Pella the manufacture verified. It took many phone calls, emails, to finally have them reinstalled. Almost two years later and our home is still not complete because of the delay. Because of the delay in the renovations to the house we lost a considerable amount of money.After months of going back and forth with executive office and promises for compensation, we received nothing. They just kept dragging us along hoping we would go away. I just hope no one ever has to endure what we did and would advise you to shop elsewhere, where there are contractors who know how to do home renovations and not have to watch a YouTube video to install doors and windows. Don't make the same mistake we did, ask for references, make sure the contractor you use is licensed insured and has documentation to prove so.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Poor Customer Service,"On Saturday November 3rd 2018 I bought a toilet at Lowes in Shawnessy Calgary. I opted for them to install the toilet at a cost of $165.00 plus tax. The only assistant working in plumbing clearly had not been trained and it took one and a half hours for him to get the installation booked into the computer for billing and to complete the contract which he needed another person to assist him with. I will say Barry the plumbing assistant was quite nice. He said the installers and those who book the installations do not work on the weekends, but the lady who books the installation will get on it first thing Monday morning and I would likely get a call Monday. He also hedged his statement by saying the installer has until Wednesday to get back to me with a time to install. Late morning Wednesday I stopped in at the Lowes in Shawnessy to see if we could get the lady who books the installer to get me a time. She rudely said that she had faxed the installation request to the installer and he has until Wednesday 8:00 pm to call me. I politely asked if she could give him a call now and we could find out the time for the install. She said no she wouldn’t do that and reminded me he has until Wednesday 8:00 pm to call me. I then went home and emailed the Manager of the store telling him of my experience with the lady who books the installations and received no response even up to the time of writing this review. The installer called at 6:18 pm during our dinner and said rudely “I’m calling to book your install for your toilet” the tone of voice was rude and inappropriate. I asked when and he said two days later between 1 and 3 pm. I politely asked if he could not do it tomorrow as we now have been without a toilet for 5 days in a condo. He again was quite rude and I admit I raised my voice with him, he then hung up on me. Thursday morning I went over to Home Depot and inquired about their toilets and installation times. They were quite helpful and were able to get a toilet and installation in a timely fashion and yes the cost of the toilet and installation was $65.00 less expensive. I returned the toilet to Lowes and got my money back. I spoke briefly with the manager of the store Glen, while getting my refund and told him of my experience, he said that is not the way it should happen. Yes he was right, but it did and even now writing this review I have heard nothing from him in the form of an email. I do not recommend anyone shop at Lowes in Canada, they clearly do not have any idea about customer service and if they continue in this manner then they are not likely to last in Canada and what that means is warranties and the like will be worthless.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Extremely Unprofessional And disinterested staff,"My husband and I are finishing our basement but wanted Lowe’s to install a wet bar, cabinets, and granite counter tops. We visited the store and got a design down and were looking at materials we wanted. The staff told us to call them to come do an in home measure when the framing was finished and it would cost us 75 dollars for the in home visit which was fine with us. When the framing was done we called to schedule a measure and a date was set. The following week we received 7 calls from 7 different people telling us that they weren’t going to come out until the visit fee was paid (which we had already agreed to do but no one ever asked for a credit card or check so we assumed it would be paid when they showed up). Three of the Lowe’s staff told us that the project we wanted was too small and that we should have a handy man do the project because it would be too expensive for us to pay for the installation. The amount of work we were doing was equivalent to a small kitchen remodel but it seemed that they were disinterested in providing us with the services they claim to offer. I’m not sure if maybe they get commission and thought that they were wasting time dealing with our 12 foot bar and post bar and cabinets but we had a large budget and were willing to spend a lot of money to have it done professionally but they were the most unprofessional and ignorant people I’ve ever dealt with.

I asked about the $120 model and that was not in stock either, and that was discontinued and no stock company wide. I asked to purchase the discontinued model off the shelf. The search began for the manager. Ten minutes later he appears and offers a whopping 10% discount, knowing it was discontinued. I told him it was an insult and I was going to Home Depot. He shrugged his shoulders. Needless to say Depot had 10 or more of a similar model on the shelf. To top things off, when paying we mentioned it was for my daughters new home and they gave us a 10% discount without asking. Definitely go to Home Depot.

The store didnt have any concern and the manager, Kathryn Wilson, said it was MY fault because I place the order intentionally with a missing part- lie! I called JeldWyn, the window company directly. They said the order was not placed to be missing parts and that Lowes should have immediately notified them and did not. The window part was wrapped loosely in plastic wrap, no box and most likely was broke by Lowes. - This held up finishined construction of our home and extra several hundred dollars to rehire our building contractor to come back a full month later. The manager Kathryn said that our contractor should work better with us - as if Lowes had no mishandling in it at all!

Lowe's Companies,"Lowe's sends proposal for deck construction, signs contract with customer, charges customer $26k, then breaks contract months later and simply refunds without interest or any service rendered!","Insane! Does this sound fancy or complicated to you? 450 sf of deck on a wooden underdeck structure, Trex decking with rain escape to create a dry space below, Prova rail system (all materials Lowe's sells), LVL beams for extra support for a tiny roof overhang, cemented poles to avoid cross beams, total deck height is 11 feet.Lowes ""Professional Services"" sold me on this deck construction job beginning of September, charged over $26k to my credit card on the same day, then postponed the material delivery and start of service 4 times, and now, after having waited 1.5 months on them getting started on a project that should have been completed by now, called me to inform me that they would just ""refund"" me and not follow through on delivering the ordered and paid service. I got completely screwed by Lowes: out of $26k, out of 1.5 months lost, dozens of hours in trouble-shooting their sub-contractor LKN Custom Homes, 1.5 months of a lot of money tied up with Lowes. You need to know that Lowes only has one (!) single sub-contractor for services they sell like deck construction, and if that one sub-contractor gets too busy because of overcommitting, and tries to find ways (and reasons) to drop projects they already committed to, Lowe's has no replacement for them. Months after having planned and designed the deck project (the entire project plan, proposal, design, calculations came from THEM!), after having had a structural engineer sign off on it, after having collected 100% of the payment up front, after having worked with my money, Lowe's simply dropped the project for not having a sub-contractor available to complete the project, and refunded the money without interest! And their lame excuse: our sub-contractor LKN Custom Homes told us that this would be ""out of the scope of work for Lowe's"" (word for word quote of their install sales support manager Jessica Kelly at the Lowe's HQ in North Carolina). So questions about that: 1. Why did Lowe's even bid on this deck project in the first place? (over two months ago, I had two cheaper proposals from other vendors which I turned down because I trusted the Lowe's brand)?2. Why did their Pro Services managers consult me months ago, on how to build it, what to do, how to design it?3. Why did they send a professional proposal on Lowe's letter head (which I have in case anyone is interested) to win this project4. Why did they immediately charge my credit card for 100% of the total project payment same day?5. Why did they ignore the structural engineer's evaluation, but claim to believe a sub-contractor who is not an engineer (and who lied to me at numerous occasions over the past weeks) 6. Why can Lowe's not explain the reason for dropping it at all? 7. Why, if they are so great as they claim, do they only have one single sub-contractor for deck construction in all of North Carolina, and when they get too busy and start turning down less comfortable jobs, Lowe's, instead of making it right to the customer, screws the customer over. 8. Why would Lowe's make themselves so dependent on one sub-contractor and allows one sub-contractor to lie to them and manipulate them? 9. Why does Lowe's have not enough integrity to do everything necessary in order to make up for it and find another sub-contractor in order to execute on the offer it made to a customer, whom they sold a service to and collected money from, 1.5 months prior. 10. How disorganized can Lowe's be not to know what is in our outside its ""scope of work"", offering and selling services they cannot deliver, and having one little sub-contractor telling them what is within or outside of their ""scope""?And mostly: how can a company get away with all of that?Any other company that I know of (including my own) would make sure the customer does not suffer like this under a bad sub-contractor (at least not in such a major way), and would find another sub-contractor, send other workers, do anything necessary, in order to follow through on a project they bid on and already charged for - especially when there has already been such an enormous delay! We are not talking about some product being unavailable in a Lowe's store and you have to drive to the next store to buy it. We are talking about a construction project into which I as a customer, and Lowe's Pro Services, had invested many hours to draw, plan, calculate, write proposals, accept proposals, sign contracts (both Lowe's and myself have signed a construction contract over this), selected and ordered materials together, turned down other vendors (and their advice not to use Lowe's!), waited, weeks after weeks for start of demo and installation service, only to be dropped because it wasn't convenient for their sub-contractor, he had taken on too many other jobs and had to turn down at least one project, with flimsy explanations which are deflated instantly when questioned. So, the reality is (and I was warned by several friends and other construction companies), that, accepting Lowe's proposal and signing a contract with them for this project beginning of September, has taught me a great lesson about never to trust apparent size (there is often nothing behind it - no manpower, no integrity, no guts). Over to the past month and a half, I have been bluntly lied to, taken advantage of, money taken out of my account, 0 service received (no products, no materials, no service at all), driven to the construction site numerous times to meet with Lowe's LKN Custom Homes contractor, only to find out that they didn't show up again, wasting dozens of hours on almost 50 phone calls to try to communicate and coordinate between Lowe's and their sub-contractor. I had to manage the sub-contractor directly, trying to get him to start on this simple deck project. I have experienced first hand that, trying to use Lowe's ""Professional Services"" for a construction project, can make you lose money (interest for funds withheld by Lowe's), your own man hours (to try to get Lowe's and their sub-contractors to deliver the service you paid for), the opportunity to build something within the timeframe you need it, and pretty much all your nerves. Highly advice not to use Lowe's or LKN Custom Homes. Unfortunately, I have experienced that they are dishonest, bully customers around and manipulate each other (between Lowe's personell and sub-contractors). As a customer you're stuck in the middle between them. Worst experience with a construction vendor I have ever made!If you are a deck construction company, or know one, contact me. I have a fantastic deck project. Nothing fancy. 455 sf of deck with Trex decking with rain escape to create a dry space below. Wooden structure, 11 foot heigh. Use 2-3 LVL beams for maximum safety.

Lowe's Companies,Fencing Headaches,"I contacted Lowes to install a privacy fence. After the estimate it all went downhill. Lowes motto is ""We Do It Right"". Oh really? I don't think so. The date was set for the install. Two days before the scheduled install I did everything I needed to do to be ready. On the date of the install no one showed up so I called Lowes and they told me that the contractor had quit. It would have been nice if they would have called me and told me that, instead of me calling them. The second contractor pushed the install back two weeks, then another week, then another week, and then several days.The following is a list of the things that happened.*Materials were delivered on time for the original install date but sat several weeks in the rain. Then come to find out not all materials were delivered for the install but I was charged for all.*After the install I had an extra 40 feet of materials leftover. I had to be persistent to get our money back for the extra materials.*Lowes offered to compensate me for the long wait on getting the install done. I asked for $100 for each week I waited but they did not give me that amount, even though they were so sorry. I wish I had $100 for every phone call I had to make to either the Lowes store or Lowes HQ. I would have the fence paid for. *The estimator needs to learn how to measure.*The person at HQ was nice and helpful most of the time but sometimes hard to reach.*The delivery and pickup person was very helpful and gave a lot of insight into Lowes policy.*I wonder why Lowes can't work with other nearby Lowes stores when one contractor quits or is unable to do the job to get another contractor.*Bad communication all the way around. Sometimes the contractor was not told info that was told to me or visa-versa. Other times the store didn't know what HQ was talking about.*I waited 4 weeks for a broken gate to be fixed that was broken by the installer. Also waited 4 weeks for the fence caps to be delivered to the store. I had to pick them up and then no one told the installer that I already had them.*It took 4 months for a 90 foot fence to be completely installed. *On one of the phone calls I made to Lowes HQ I was asked to participate in a survey at the end of my call. I agreed to do that but was never given the opportunity. I am posting my opinion now to save others from the headaches with Lowes.*Never trust Lowes to do a big job! This is not my first bad experience with Lowes. I wonder if Lowes would like to hear about my other experience. Sometimes living in a small college town has its advantages because neighbors know what's going on and I certainly told my story to those who wanted to listen. The reply of ""we will never call them to do a job"" was echoed many times.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Fencng: poor installation,"Fencng:We moved into our home which already had a partial vinyl privacy fence installed, therefore we only had to install additional 74 feet of fence to make it fully enclosed. First, the crew consisted of 2 men whoe acted like this was their first day of doing any type of labor. The one guy wore basketball shots and sneakers. Also, we could not communicate with each other since they spoke no English. They then used a small shovel that looked like a kids toy to dig out the holes for the fence post. It took them almost 11 hours to finish, it was dark when they finished so I couldn't fully see the finished product until the next day. The next day I noticed how poor of a job they did: 1. The fence and the gate was crooked. 2. They ovepoured cement at one of the posts. 3. There were at least 2 posts in which they did not pour at the back of the posts so it was flimsy, and could make the fence fall over. 4. They poorly cut the fence panel that was inserted between the new and old fence.When I called the contractor, he came out, looked and basically thought nothing was wrong. The two men who did the fence did come out and tried to fix what they needed to. But in the end the entire fence needs to be redone. It was poorly done.I definitely would not recommend doing any type of fencing with Lowe's, do not waste your money, because in the end you are going to end up redoing everything!",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Shopping, Customer Service, Gift Card Issue, Online Transaction","Due to time concerns, I don't write reviews, but when I do, PLEASE READ before you make worst decision of your life. Lowe's is a WORST place to shop at, since they are stupid, dump, idiotic, worst customer service, folks who hat to be at work, and folks who are taking depression Med. Managers are award winner losers who will find worst answer possible which will make you laugh and cry at same time. Purchased an item showing available at Marlboro, MD, paid half with Lowe's E gift card and rest with credit card. After two hours got a call from an associate telling me that he cancel the order since Lowes.com is wrong about this item. These are discontinues item, however showing 7 available at another location which at later, I called and confirmed. An associate himself who was cursing Lowes as well Lowes.com, so what would you expect? Anyway, I asked where is my e-card balance, and was advise, it should be back in e-card, which was a lie, spoke to manage of the store, and was told to come to store for card balance, even though the item I pushed was for house in VA and plumber was going to pick it up, but she wanted me to fly from Chicago to MD and get the balance back. Called 1-800, was on phone for more then an hour, wasted my time, got transfer to a manger, and same exact story. Now not sure how will I get my $293 to be exact from Lowe's which I paid with a e-gift card. Notice here, they claim they don't have E-Card's anymore, even though someone give me a days before purchase. To all, Be Aware, Home Depot might be little expensive, but after this experience, I will stay away from Lowe's and will advise any who does shop at Lowe's. I wish Lowe's goes down as circuit cityAt end, LOWE'S, please someday call or shop at HomeDepot, and you will see how much they love to help and care for customer. I only choose you since I had a gift card, and wanted to try something new, but you fail. You fail big time. I hope all who dont have time to waste never shop at you.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,We purchased a Samsung front-load …,"We purchased a Samsung front-load washer, model number WF42H5200HAF with the extended warranty From St. Charles Lowes 2900 West Clay St., Saint Charles, MO 63301, Store# 1057 2 years ago. I called Lowes because They contracted with Mid America Service for warranty service. I scheduled the appointment on Saturday and they sent me an email confirmation on Tuesday to confirm my appointment. I sent a email back the same day and time I received the email with a confirmation of the date and time window of 8am-5pm CST. I called Lowes appliances back and spoke with Steve in appliances and he told me that my extended service warranty was not with Lowes but a third party company that handles that issue and Lowes doesn't handle that issue. So I explained to Steve I purchased the warranty from Lowes and the company represents Lowes. Steve put me on hold after I explain to him my issue and I was 5 minutes away and If need be I will come up to the store. Steve put me on hold so I went to Lowes while he still had me on hold. The whole time I spoke with the Appliance Manager Diane, I was still on hold with Steve for 36 minutes. I did not get my appointment because they had the wrong phone number that Lowes gave them and Lowes has the right phone number in there system. I had to reschedule my appointment two days out and I never received an apology from Steve from being on hold. I would not recommend this location to anyone.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes terrible service,"Sunday, Sept. 23 we stopped in the Brookhaven store to buy a Maytag wash machine. The sales woman was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. We were told that it coud be delivered Monday, Sept. 24. We should expect a call or text late Sunday night to confirm. Between 2pm and 4pm with a 30 minute prior to arrival is what the text said. I made myself available all day since some companies have arrived earlier than expected. I waited till 3:55 Monday then I decided to call XPO myself. I was informed that the route had been changed and it won't be delivered till 5pm - 7pm. I wanted to know why I DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL EARLIER? The rep sounded surprised and asked, ""you did not get called?"" NO CALL!!!!! then asked to speak with a manager. I was put on hold for 20 minutes before I left my number and hung up. I then called the store that it was purchased from. I wanted to speak to a manager and was bounced around, transferred, put on hold till finally Carrie answered from shipping. I informed her of the situation and I was furious to say the least!!!!!! All I got back from her was brush off book answers. Telling me that they are aware of the poor service from XPO but there is nothing they can do.... REALLY! I have worked in customer service and I have held management positions in the past. I know when I am being dismissed! She played dumb and gave me wise answers like ""We cant' get your time back."" I let her know that we did not shop at Home Depot for the same issue. THey seem to also use XPO for shipping as well. That phone call lasted 25 minutes. More time wasted. After an hour or so XPO called back from Massachusetts!!! REALLY. And it wasnt even a manager. Then shortly after XPO callled back from my message. THE UPPER MANAGER THAT SPOKE TO MY GIRLFRIEND OUTRIGHT LIED ABOUT A PREVIOUS CALL TO THE HOUSE. We track every call, missed call, voice mail and so on. One of the annoying things about our phone but in this case it worked. She told him that there was no call to which he seemed cornered and asked if we are no available tonight? THe shippers arrived around five of seven . When questioned they immediately responded with telling us they called the dispatcher early in the day to move everything back 2 hours... I AM DISGUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE SERVICE I RECEIVED ALL THE WAY AROUND. AS I MENTIONED TO THE LOWES MANAGER, ""I REALIZE YOU HAD NO IDEA AND ALREADY KNOW THE DELIVERY COMPANY IS BAD BUT YOU ARE LOSING MY BUSINESS AS WELL AS OTHER REVIEWS I READ ON YELP BECAUSE HER Terrible CUSTOMER SERVICE."" I ended by telling her both then and the following day that if I WERE THE MANAGER THERE I WOULD BE MAKING PHONE CALL TO XPO AND DEMANDING A MANAGER. AS WELL AS CONTINUALLY CONTACTING CORPORATE TO LET THEM KNOW JUST HOW BAD XPO IS AND LOYATLY IS DEMINISHING.. It seems to me that instead of training true customer service managers Lowe's is training managers to bs their way through any bad issues with the company. NICE JOB LOWEs. IF it were up to me I would lowes to stick it up their butt. (PS the washer did not fit so it went back anyways)",0,1

Lowe's Companies,DON'T DO IT...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,"After 5 weeks of setting up meetings around multiple people's schedule we paid in full for a new countertop, backsplash, sink and cooktop. Yes, that is all. We paid in full on 7.4.2018. We just found out today they are excited to be installing the countertop on 10.10.2018. This has been one joke and hassle after another. Lowes does nothing, NOTHING, to help. If anything they placate only. I would never have let their contractor come in my house if I had known he is incompetent and way too busy to care about the job. He has caused delays due to his total lack of knowledge about the details, has failed to come and check the workers jobs (calling only once at 6:3pm to tell us he was too busy, were we happy? We paid for him to answer that question!). The countertop is being fabricated only 90 miles from our house, but we have now waited since 7.4.2018 for them to do just that. Vendors do not communicate with Lowes, Lowes does not communicate with vendors or CUSTOMERS. Everytime we contacted people to find out what is being done and what is being scheduled (which is always nothing) there was another name added to the list of people who were ""on this"". However, no one is ""on this"". We feel we made an epic mistake with Lowes and have no hope this project will ever come to an end. They communicate that everything is going well. Really? So why 4 months - 1/3 of the entire year to get this done? They are all paid so there is no reason for them to do this in a timely manner. However, as a customer, they have FAILED MISERABLY AND THEIR PROCESS ALLOWS THEM TO FAIL MISERABLY AND WITHOUT CONCERN FOR THE CUSTOMER. Don't buy anything you can't carry out of the store. I know we won't be buying from them ever again. We will manage our own next remodel job. Shame on everyone we have dealt with for their lies and for their lack of interest.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Lowes.com does not deliver as promised,"On September 3rd, I researched multiple vendors to purchase a refrigerator. I placed an order with Lowes.com based on the availability and delivery date. The website did not indicate that this was a special order item nor did it indicate that the delivery could be delayed for weeks. It stated delivery the week of Sept 19th and I received written confirmation of that via e-mail. I received another email confirmation on the day prior to scheduled delivery with a delivery window of 8 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. At 5:15 p.m. that same day I received a phone call from the distribution center stating there was delay and the delivery had been rescheduled for October 4th. I would NOT have purchased this refrigerator had it been clear to me that it was a special order or if I had any indication that it may not deliver for a month. The expectation in which I gave lowes.com my money was delivery in 2 weeks. It was not until 5:15 p.m., the day prior to scheduled delivery, that there was any indication that the refrigerator would not be delivered.This presents real hardship for my family as we have 2 families (10 people) that had to be evacuated from their home due to hurricane Florence staying with us. We have operated out of coolers and counted the days until delivery of the fridge as promised by Lowe's.I talked with 3 different customer service representatives who said they would research and get back with me, none of which bothered to call me back.I called a fourth time and asked to speak with a manager. She told me there was nothing to be done. Best case scenario is delivery Oct. 4th.I will never, never do business with Lowes.com again. I have no faith that they will deliver as promised. With Amazon as well as other vendors that I deal with on a regular basis, deliveries arrive as promised, communication is clear. I have multiple e-mail confirmations from Lowes.com that my delivery will happen today. I was told this was a mistake and shouldn't have been sent to me. My family is left in a real situation because we trusted the written communication from Lowes.com. I will not make that mistake again.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,New Lowe's  roof is a nightmare,"Disappointed with workers Lowe's sent to my house to install a new roofs. I contracted with Lowe's for a new roof. I had been getting estimates for the job with both a complete tear off and a layer over the single layer I had. Lowe's price for a tear off was similar to prices I was getting for a second layer and decided to use them for the job. The person that delivered the supplies was very professional and I was sure I had made a good choice. Monday morning the crew arrived and their van did not have the name of the company Lowe's told me was going to do the job. The person introduced himself and said they were short handed and the one day job would take two. 15 minutes later a man arrived from the company Lowe's told me to expect. I researched the company I was told would be doing the job and they had good reviews. I was not told that the company could then subcontract the job. John the man form the company I though was doing the job was very nice and seemed professional. They did the tear off and then John left that is when things went bad. It got very quiet and there were no cars in the driveway so I went out to get the garbage can and bring it up to the house. That is when I saw we had two workers napping in the driveway. Work stopped for over 2 hours while the other workers were gone and the 2 took a nap. A van came back with 2 workers and they did some clean up laid the ice the shield and felt. John never returned and after working an hour the men left for the day. After my husband came home he found a nail in the driveway where he parks. We were worried about his tires and started looking. We spent an hour picking up nails all over our driveway. It is a miracle one did not get in his tire.I called to complain to the salesman who sold us the roof and he acted like I was crazy to be concerned. He told me that John told him all the guys were sick. They had been throwing up in the woods. He made an off color joke that it was Monday and maybe they partied to hard over the weekend. He told me it would go better the second day when everyone was sober. I felt my concerns where blown off. My husband then called and got the same story they were sick and it was no big deal that the driveway was littered with nails they would do better today . I think if your crew is that sick either they needed to go home and not do my roof in that condition or they needed John to stay and supervise. The second day was stressful because myself and my husband had complained and the tension was high. I personally did not feel good about the judgement of letting them do my roof when sick or drunk. Because we complained John stayed all day and videoed them cleaning up. The roof looks good but has spots that concern me and I am going to be worried until we have a few good rains. I am not a roofer but something looks wrong. While doing the job they hung up tarps to catch debris but they caught very little of it. To remove the tarp they drug it over my new railing on the deck and covering with tar. That is how the front was also done and why my gravel driveway is full of nails. My gutters now have the spikes sticking have out of them that were not banged back it.I later learned a window was also cracked. The pipe that takes sewer gas out the roof was broken in the attic and gasses are now flowing into my home. The roof had boards with holes that the salesman and contractor were informed of before work was does.The roofers instead of replacing boards with holes paper and shingled over. From inside the attic you can see the paper. In spots nails are stick through the paper in area with no wood. Below the ridge vent there is a large gap between boards that was not fixed. The gap is well over a half inch wide and runs the length of the attic without H Clips holding the boards together. There is rippling and shingles popping up. We were told it would get better as the sun baked it. If anything it is now worse than day one. We have been calling and emailing since my husband got home from work on the first day of work. We have had no help. I do not want the original worked here. I do not trust their work. I was told arrangements would be made for someone to come look at the damages over a week ago but was never called back. We have been picking up nail, roofing paper, and pieces of singles everywhere. I had the railing on my deck replaced before the roof and there is tar all over it. We know have a broken window, roof with holes and gaps we think will leak, sewer gasses flowing into the house, shingles popping up and no offer of a repair. I posted earlier on Lowe's facebook and my post was removed. I only has one layer off singles on my roof but went with a complete tear off by Lowe's because i wanted my roof done right. I have no faith in the roof Lowe's installed and more damage than before they started.Latest update-I called once again because no one returns calls or emails.I just got off the phone with the Lowe's manager from in charge of my install named Fred. He want to send the original installers who came to my house drunk and hung over to install my roof. He said it will take 4 -6 weeks to find anyone else. I will not have the crew that destroyed property to my house. I have methane gas in my house, broken window, holes in the roof and I need them fixed. I no longer have any faith in Lowe's warranty or ability to do the job they said they could.",0,1

Installer came within a few days to measure the door and then we never heard back from Lowes. After 2 weeks went by we called Customer Service twice who said they were having trouble contacting the installer. Installer finally called and gave us a date of Sept 21, 2018. So now we have a date for a month from when we bought the door (which was in stock at the time).

When I selected it I got a recording saying the call could not be taken and I was disconnected!I had called to try and resolve the non delivery of my purchase. After the promised time frame had elapsed and I had to go back to work, I called the delivery company at the number they had left on my voice mail when they'd notified me that the delivery would be made between 11.30am and 1.30pm. At 2 I called them out of courtesy to say that I had to leave and wouldn't be able to return until after 4pm. To my astonishment the agent tried to tell me that delivery promised between those hours didn't mean I would get my delivery during those hours. Crazy huh? Rather than try to debate defined meaning with someone who was either casually mendacious or unfamiliar with his native language, I called the corporate office. After overcoming much of their evasiveness I was able to state my concern with the assurance that they would forward it to the appropriate person in the department of the Chief Customer Officer (hard to believe that they have one given the poor performance I was experiencing on that front). I then called the local store where I made the purchase and finally got through to the manager. He heard me out and then committed to having the local dispatcher from the delivery company call me within 20 minutes. That never happened. The next day I received an email from corporate saying my concern had been ""escalated"" to the senior management at my local store and I would receive a response withing 24 hours. That never happened either. I am faced with having paid for a product that hasn't been delivered and that the company doesn't care to resolve. What a disreputable company. Beware buyers.

There is no way to reach a supervisor, or management of any kind. It is the poor customer service agents that handle it all without a lot of support. NEVER NEVER order from this company!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,It is with great sadness,"It is with great sadness that I write this post. My husband and I have depended on Lowe's for ALL of our home improvement needs for many years, BUT NO MORE!!!!! They have lied, and lied, and lied some more. Their customer service is HORRIBLE and they obviously do not give a damn if they make a sale or not. Today is Aug 28th. I have been trying to buy a new stove since August 2nd. Lowe's has screwed this sale on a hundred different levels a hundred different times. I truly believe that they are simply clueless robots that don't give a rat's behind about customers. GOOD BYE TO GOOD RIDDANCE !!!!!!!",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Complete RIP off,"Complete RIP off. Purchased a whole house generator and it hasn't worked from day one. Installer had to fix a wire that was never sent with the generator. Now the generator needs a sensor. I tried contacting the store manager, who completely blew me off and CPO is just as bad. I sent an email to the CEO, who passed it on to one of his minions to deal with it. I asked for the generator to be replaced due to all the problems it has already, only to be told I have to have it fixed. I asked for a refund and was told I can't get a refund. I then call Generac to find out that the wire is not sent with the units, the Installer has to order it. I also found out that none of the repairs have been reported to Generac, which voids the warranty. Lowe's is trying to tell me that's not true. I also work for an Appliance repair company which I know for a fact that any manufacturer warranty repairs have to be done by a company that is certified and parts have to be purchased from a certified dealer. Lowe's is still trying to say that's not true. So I am out $15,000 and my generator still doesn't work. I asked for money back and I get told I have to wait until it's fixed, I'm sure that will never happen. I also found out that the Installers don't have to be certified in what they Install, great right. So anyone can apply and say they know how to Install an item and get hired.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Great costumer service,"I have purchases two appliances and one security door in the last 17 months along with a large outside light. The managers are really helpful and very professional and polite. As in all of life there were some problems along the way, but whatever the problem the managers made it right and never tried to pass the buck. The last two delivery young men named Mark and Brian were so excellent. Great attitudes even though they were working well into the night after 8, and that after a very long hot day in Florida. Very polite and careful not to damage anything. Extremely respectful. It was a delight to have them bring my washer. Dave, Michelle, Kevin, Jacklyn are managers that were very helpful along the way. They would have gotten 5 stars but the apts for the deliveries can get mixed up so be sure to confirm with a person the day before or day of your time of delivery. Other then that I am very pleased with most of the people working at Lowe's. And am glad I have a store like this to depend on.",0,4

I saw this website and thought that there could be no way so many people like myself could have such a bad experience with a company without them changing their practices, but- there is and it is Lowe’s. I’ve spent over $5,000 with them on 2 vanities and a shower install and I don’t have enough time or room to write all the horrible things that went wrong (many trips back to the store, many phone calls, months of waiting for 1 Install that was 2 months over due after they came to my house 3 times). Items were cracked, built improperly and the sales team didn’t know there own products they were selling. Lowe’s has lost my business and I will never shop there again.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Poor carpet Installation,"Had Lowes install carpet in my home. We got high quality carpet and paid over $8,000.00. After 15 months the carpet developed rolls and ridges due to poor installation. Lowes has a one year warranty but many carpet issues develop after the 12 month warranty. I called both the local and corporate office and they were unwilling to budge on the installation issues. They didn't even acknowledge that they would look into the subcontracted installers, so the chance of this happening to someone else is a possibility. Do not allow Lowes to install carpet in your home",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Don't pay for a quote they don't give.,"So before opening my shop, I called Lowe's to get a quote for flooring. Had to pay $45 to get them to come over and measure the shop and give me a quote. Not only that, but there was a dip in the floor. I wanted to know how much it would coast to fix.... Guess what people. I never got my quote. Called a few week later. Spoke to the right store of the guy who came to give the quote. Was told they would call me back to give me the numbers (well after I have moved on and had to get the store ready).... Never got that quote. But I get a letter in the mail about coupons and offerings today that made me think about that quote. Do not pay them to give you a quote. Still waiting on mine....

Lowe's Companies,If I could give zero stars I would,"If I could give zero stars I would. Customer service does not exist at Lowes. In March I went to look at patio doors. Was told their installers had to do the measuring. That took over 3 weeks. Purchased the door April 19th. Door was installed June 13th. It was damaged. Store ordered a new door. Second door was installed July 17th. It was defective from the factory. I'm waiting on confirmation of the 3rd order. Why don't I stop you ask? Because on the first installation they cut out my old door to the point that it was no longer useable and because they completed the installation I am not eligible for a refund ($7000.00). And I would have a huge hole in my house until I could find a replacement. The door had to be paid for in full before they would order it so they have had my money almost 5 months and I do not have an acceptable door. Lock set that I was required to buy from door manufacturer does not fit the door, so it does not even lock. So frustrated but at this point it's just a joke. I call every other day for an update, and it's always the same, they will check and call me back. Of course they never do.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Know-nothing salespeople,"Know-nothing salespeople. I went in to order a shower door, and the company who makes them needed to call me to schedule a date to measure. They never called, so I call the store, only to find out that company does not have an install team in my city. Would have been nice if the salesperson in the bathroom department had known that. I should have just walked away when he didn't understand the kind of glass and frame I wanted even when I was pointing directly at it",0,1

I was at home all the day but it was delivered to a Canada post Branch instead of my home and made a huge problem for me to pickup it from Canada Post branch. When I asked Canada Post the reason of not delivering to my home, they said because the package was big and heavy and they did not want to put it t my front door!!! That was exactly the reason I wanted to deliver at my home!!. They didn't even not tried to come and see if I am at home or not.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Serious Lack of Communication with Online Purchase,"We ordered 4 appliances online during the July 4th, 2018 sale. We were delighted to receive a call 2 days later telling us delivery would be the next day. After emptying the fridge and cleaning it, the drivers arrived with 2 of the 4 appliances. They told me the fridge and dishwasher were coming from another store. Obviously, no one bothered to mention that when they scheduled our delivery. Then they refused to remove the appliances (stove and microwave) until WE disconnected them. There is absolutely no mention that they would not disconnect appliances when you select the ""Haul Away"" option for which you are charged $20 per item. Unless you purchase installation - which you have to do separately by filling out an online form and then you still have to go into the store to sign a contract (told to me by Lowe's customer service, when I called THEM) your new appliances will be sitting in the middle of the floor, unusable, until someone installs them and there is no guarantee when they will show up. Then Lowe's (again no communication about it) says they are going to hold up the refrigerator delivery until the dishwasher is available. After much arguing, they finally agreed to bring the refrigerator before the dishwasher. It came from the Clearwater store. We live in Lutz and our Lowe's is 5 min away (where the stove and microwave came from). None of this makes sense to me and most of all, not informing us was ridiculous. We finally had the dishwasher delivered today. Again, paid for removal but he wouldn't touch it until it was disconnected. Since it had been almost 4 weeks, we forgot about that or we could have been prepared. My advice is if you order online, ask lots of questions before or during the process! Make sure to find out if the order is being delivered completely, how you arrange for installation, if you have to disconnect anything, etc. They aren't going to be offering any information! We wanted to be thrilled about our new kitchen! But the lack of communication, split delivery, no information about what had to be disconnected, all have made this way more stressful and unhappy than it had to be.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,TERRIBLE EVERYTHING,"My mom has been having her home remodeled since early 2017. She was told by the interior design consultant and her contractors that everything would be done July 12th 2017. Yes, 17 not 18. A year ago. The FIRST set of contractors provided by lowes was a bunch of Russians who seemed not to have even been licensed, installed almost everything in her house wrong, wrong cabinet doors, wrong trim, used the trim for the bathroom in the kitchen. This was after waiting 4 months AFTER the finishing date for them to even start. Then a few months later, well past when it should have been done, after my mother called lowes for the millionth time either to no response or no viable explanation as to why it was taking so long, the Russians disappear. No, really. They left the country and took her money according to Lowes. NOW 4 more months later there's a group of contractors. All seems fine except one guy acts suspicious. Iphone 7 plus goes missing, okay can't prove it and move on. Then, a few days ago my mother walks up her stairs, sees that the box to her $900 roomba has been tampered with. They stole it from the box that had been there for months, SCOTCH TAPED it back together, and left only the box. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.",0,1

TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!THEIR STAFF IS INCOMPETENT , THEIR RETURN POLICY IS TERRIBLE , AND THEY LACK MERCHANDISE .... IF YOU MUST GO TO A LOWES ....GO TO A LOWES IN NEW JERSEY!!!!!!!!!!This is the worst consumer experience / customer service I have ever received in my 40 years of living , and I must say I regret I did not make my purchase at the home depot around the corner. This Lowes store has been around for the last year or so. Every time I come to this location at Ridge Hill mall Yonkers, I never find what I am looking for . The staff is rude , and never in the aisles. It seems like merchandise gets stolen there all the time because when I check my Lowes app to see if an item is in stock at the actual store, they never seem to have it. Everything is expensive, you think your getting quality merchandise, but its the same exact quality as home depot, if not inferior for a greater price, I GUARANTEE. The staff when you finally do get them to help you seem incompetent and ""not in the mood to help"". I highly recommend The Home Depot. The Home Depots Return policy is much easier and their staff is much more knowledgeable. The stock at this particular Lowes is less than adequate. I suggest if you cannot make it to home depot around the corner from this store then you are better off supporting your local mom and pop store, in accordance to supply and price. My complaint is about a customer service representative and Lowe's customer service as a whole. Long story short I had a Kohler claim for a $600 defective Kohler cast iron white sink. Kohler gave me a credit and told me to take it to any LOWES ,and they will credit me for a brand new sink free of charge since a cast iron kohler sink is not suppose to chip and has lifetime warranty.... an online representative told me to just bring the credit to my nearest LOWES. So i did, I left my work early, and got to the LOWES at around 3:30pm to receive the merchandise that was promised to me. Upon arriving at the Lowes the said customer representative was supposedly on lunch at 3:30 PM , so I waited around the area. At around 4:30 PM I went back to the LOWES to meet with the representative and a customer service rep stated that the associate had left for the day to call her in the morning.The next morning i called the LOWES store at ridge hill Yonkers to talk to the representative and let her know I have a Kohler credit but I work 9AM- 5PM which clashes with her hours. The sales associate stated that I can email her my credit and send someone to claim it. When i sent some to claim it the dummies at LOWES stated that the representative was not in and did not leave any notes. WASTE OF TIME AGAIN. Finally i myself went to the store after 20 minutes of waiting for the associate to meet me after customer service paged her, the representative stated that i never emailed her the paperwork , when i had it saved in my sent outbox. After that the representative told me to email the credit again and wait for her, so i did. After 30 minutes of waiting again i spoke to another representative who had to reach out her AGAIN . After that the representative took my order. About ,50 Minutes later the same represetative whom i had a bad experience with called me and let me know that she needs my original receipt, when i spoke to her on the phone the first time she said i did not need it when i specifically asked her if it was necessary . I called Kohler and the rep said its not necessary but up to the workers disgression. Long story short i lost my original receipt and cannot use my credit. WASTE OF TIME WITH NO SINK . TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,I purchased a refrigerator,"I purchased a refrigerator, whirlpool, at Lowe's and paid to have it delivered to my home. They were 2 days late and then didn't want to install because they would have to take the doors off and they still have 2 more deliveries to make. So after calling their supervisor they removed the doors and dented my door in doing so, they got it in. Putting the doors back on they have never been level again and the huge dent really took away from my new fridge! I also purchased the extra warranty, don't ever do this, after my new purchase 7 short months later, the 23rd of December my fridge went out!!! Lost all my food and all the holiday food I had been making for 3 days. I called the warranty company, not Lowe's!, and I was without a fridge until January15th. The service guy broke my bottom drawer and 2 door shelves and said he would order new ones, still waiting on those a year later, never saw or heard from him again! Then called about the food replacement insurance to discover that they only cover $200 period! So in order to collect that I had to do a complete itemized list of loss up to $200 and replacement cost and fax that in, 12 times to date, which they never nor will they ever receive it. So $2980 later I have a dent, non level door, with no shelves in the door, missing a drawer, fridge for for the garage! Thanks Lowe's.",0,1

Just said ""if you want to order one, you'll have to pay"" I said ""I guess so""She transferred me again to yet another department.

I recently purchased over $500 worth of 2x6x10' and 2x8x16's for my deck. 2 weeks after the deck was completed, the 2x8 top-cap dried and warped. Absolutely ridiculous!!I've eaten bananas straighter than these boards. Lowes deceptively sells nice freshly cut wet lumber so it appears straight as an arrow to get people to buy it. Then a few days or weeks after you get it home (usually already painted and or installed) it warps and has to be ripped out. Now all of the top-cap (120 lineal feet) will have to be removed and replaced. This after I spent over two hours sifting through worse junk than what I purchased!!It's not just their lumber,...everything they sell is cheap quality junk(Home Junco is no better) Oh sure,..it comes in a nice shinny package and looks all wonderful...but it's ALL cheap Chinese junk! Lowe's has lost yet another customer for life. I'm done throwing my hard earned money away on their trash. Like so many others, I am waiting for the day when Lowes goes the way of Sears and K-mart. The sooner we the people stop shopping there, then the sooner we the people can collectively punish Lowes and accelerate their way over-due collapse...Besides, E-bay and Amazon offer most of what the cheap home improvement stores sell for WAY less without the commute, wasted gas or door-dings..Ever notice how few people there are in the store while you are shopping?

Lowe's Companies,Lowes needs to listen more or get out of the industry,"a contractor for the last 12 years and I can't stand lowes. Reasons. 1. The staff is rude. 2. Stores only 1 / 4th of the construction building codes material in stock. 8 out of 10 times I come in to the store for a specific item for my construction projects all they say is sorry we don't stock them. Well then I have to drive to home Depot and they carry everything in Stock. Home Depot carries every thing that codes require for building. It seems they listen to their builders. 3. Lowes does not listen to these complaints. I've brought this to them over and over and their response is management doesn't have time to deal with this. I'm pretty sure that if I can't find state code building materials then other contractors can't either. It hurts me as a contractor to go waste my time to find out that so many items are not considered important to the management but are requirements for the industry. Some of my projects are closer to lowes than home depot and I don't mind either one. But lowes is wasting so much time that it needs to be put out there for others to hear this and maybe the management will find time to take this seriously. Otherwise lowes will just be a Paint store.4. The few Material that lowes does carry is so limited that when I do get it. It only covers portions of my projects. We build projects anywhere from 5,000 sqft to 10,000 sqft. We spend average $30,000 a month with home depot but maybe $1,000. With lowes. To everyone.

Visit your local ProServices desk to learn more and start saving. Offers subject to change and may not be available in all Lowe's stores. Its a bait and switch scam.........as a contractor i set up purchase orders for customers to pay . these are set up with the Volume discount pricing program usually represents about 10% off yet when the customer pays for the material the discount is not added to the bill they say you need to be a pro and have a pro account for the discount.............I say it doesn't matter who pays the bill or where the savings go's .Home Depot doesn't do this or hassle the contractor when he sets up the purchase order. when an average customer spends $100.00 per visit and a contractor walk in the door with 80 other customers ( an 8000.00 purchase order) and they argue the point with him when Home Depot doesn't ...*0 people have just walked out the door with -$8000.00 in sales.....+ the 15,000 in future sales now gone to Home Depot............They are not up front about this with contractors or anyone else for that matter and only want to increase sales for there own Credit card Pro accounts, which is not the same program........ I will be sending a letter in writing to the corporate offices with data of the lost revenue to that particular store by way of Home Depot purchase receipt copies as attached files... and a fully explained version of this particular incident and the same last year as this is progressively growing and spreading across regional spears as local management meets and discusses the margin increase from the pro credit accounts they have been getting with this policy.

Lowe's Companies,Need windows don't go to Lowe's,It's been a year since I had windows installed by Lowe's of Oneonta New York.

The installer again arrived late and worked half a day before leaving to respond to a different job site. After the windows were installed they look great. Afterward and seven months into the ordeal I called the manager back who stated that I would have to sign off all recourse for the purchase and installation if a problem raised during the warranty period. I refused to sign and promised the manager that I would never use Lowe's nor purchase anything from the Lowe's company as well as I would go out of my way to see that anyone I know will never use them either. I purchase Home Depot gift cards for friends and family and to this date I have spend over 8500.00 at Home Depot and an additional 2300.00 at other local stores on my various projects.,0,2

It will never get over 425 degrees, will not cook steaks, never hot enough. I called charbroil and lady said should get hotter, she had me try several things, no change. She had a new regulator sent out. Put it on, no change. Tried another new tank, no change. I called charbroil and the guy said will not go over 450 degrees. As it was over 3 months now, went to Lowe's and they said there is nothing they will do. Called charbroil and said all they will do is give me a $75.00 towards a new charbroil. This grill is rated 36,000 BTU. I have another home with a charbroil, and it gets up two 650 degrees in less than 10 minutes and it is rated at 40,000 BTU. Got no help so going to the dump. No more charbroil for me.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Nightmare of Disaster,"I'm writing the review to warn others to never use Lowes on remodeling jobs of any sort. The nightmare began when we first signed our contract with them on January 3, 2018. We went through the inside sales department. The job began with the saleswoman walking us down many isles saying ""that would look nice""...and taking notes as we walked. The job was supposed to be a simple remodel. We looked at the Lowes website and chose some of the fixtures...new faucets, new lights, new vanity top and tile for the shower remodel. She kept pushing Onyx products on us. (the most expensive pieces, of course). We described the shower door we wanted but unfortunately it wasn't on the showroom floor. So once again, we mention privacy door and she wrote notes for an Onyx privacy door and shower pan. The vanity top was also an Onyx product. What they failed to mention was that Onyx products are special order items that can take a month or more to get in the Lowes warehouse.We then find out that the stories about their contractors having thorough background checks was a lie. The first contractor was sent in for the pre-construction meeting at our home. They looked over things, made tick marks in a fancy notebook...flipping through the pages quickly and asked us to sign yet another contract with Lowes contractor. We were only allowed to call the project manager, who was never available. The vanity came in the wrong color so that was the first stop to the remodel job and it took another several weeks of waiting. Finally, the new colored vanity came in and it was back to work for the crew. The crew was divided into sub-contractors of the Lowes appointed contracting firm. The first crew changed the start date to the second week in April 2018. Yeah, this was the fourth month of waiting. The second crew, the tile guys didn't speak any English. They were two illegal immigrants working under the table. Well, we were told that they would only be here for two hours to finish the Kerdi sheet rock vapor seal. What really happened was they snooped around in a closed closet to find our safe and they stole over $2000 worth of gold jewelry. We had to make a police report and deal with the original contractor who denied the event ever happened. We told Lowes that we wanted a new contractor. A week later, they sent a 23-year-old with one-year experience to finish tiling the shower. He tiled the shower alright. But none of the sides or the shower pan are level. Then he hung part of the shower door crooked into the tile and not into the studs making the door so crooked that it left a 1/4"" gap down the side of the door. Then this young man told us that the other half of the door was too long and had to be re-ordered through Onyx. This meant another month wait. And now were into May and the entire shower looks like a person watched YouTube lessons before doing the tile work.Today, May 10, 2018...we are still waiting for Lowes store managers to return calls. We tried Lowes Corporate only to be re-connected back to the local Lowes general manager. And he's either at lunch or left for the day. Lowes has been avoiding us for weeks now and after five months of waiting the shower is still not usable. The shower was supposed to be converted into an ADA handicap accessible shower. But the measurements don't match. We had another independent contractor come over to evaluate this shower and he just shook his head and pointed out all the flaws. His company could have saved us $4,000 had we chosen his company. The total price of this horrible remodel through Lowes came to $12,400. And the only way to correct the errors made, is to gut the whole shower and start from scratch with an independent professional contractor who warned us to avoid Lowes. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this review this has been a never-ending nightmare!!",0,1

Attempted to use it again, it doesn’t work. Call Lowe’s told to bring it in. Took it back to the store, they sent it to Louisiana first then Austin, Texas, stating that the carbarator was clogged, oil dirty, gas in the tank and missing apart. Wanted her to pay for it, mind you it’s still under warranty. They attempted to claim that it was the owners fault. How could that be, only used the thing once. It was drained before taking it to Lowe’s. There was nothing wrong with the oil, it was clean. Lowe’s put it together, whatever was missing it’s on them. Called the warranty and manufacture, no luck. They wanted her to pay $180 for shipping and an additional amount to fix. Told Lowe’s it was a return, they could do whatever they wanted to, take it off her card. Called the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, filed a claim, they all refused to cooperate or answer to the BBB. Now they are saying she is delinquent on her payments, mind you she has been paying them monthly. Will be filing another claim with the BBB. Lowe’s, Troy Built, and the warranty company are WORTHLESS.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Delivery driver told me ""be there in 30 min"" - they NEVER SHOWED","I went to the Lowes Webster, NY store on 4/16/2018 to finalize my decision on which refrigerator to purchase. On Tuesday 4/17/2018, I made my decision and called the same store and placed an order for a Whirlpool WRT518SZFM. I received an email on 4/18/2018 confirming my purchase.On Monday 4/23/2018 I received a voice mail concerning the delivery. In a return call I made I was told my new refrigerator would be delivered on Thursday 4/26/2018. I arranged to take the day off from work. I received a phone call Wednesday evening 4/25/2018 telling me the “delivery window” for my new refrigerator would be a 4 hour window centered around 3:00 pm Thursday 4/26/2018.At 2:34PM Thursday 4/26/2018 I received a call from someone identifying them selves as a Lowes delivery truck person, telling me that my new refrigerator would be delivered within 30 minutes. I removed all food from my working though VERY loud refrigerator so that it could be set aside, and the new one put in its place. As one, two, three hours went by with NO further contact, I contacted Lowes. I was surprisingly told that my old refrigerator was to be picked up today, Thursday 4/26/2018, and my new refrigerator delivered on 4/29/2018.I was shocked that no one from Lowes would do ANYTHING to retain my business, other then say “we’re sorry”.I can go to Rochester, NY small claims court, file a small claims lawsuit for a $10 fee, for 1) cost of my loosing a day of work, 2) loss food due to your telling me the delivery was 30 minutes away. Lowe’s options would be 1) send an employee to argue against my claim, perhaps paying that person $10 an hour for the 20 minute drive there, the 20 minute wait until my case is heard, the 20 minute argument, and the 20 minute return drive. So, perhaps $20 for that persons time. Then there’s the chance I’d win my case. Or 2) you could ignore the small claims suit, and I would win by default. And still, NO ONE from Lowes company will do anything more then say “we’re sorry”.",0,1

I will never shop there again. For me Lowes has been great. I bought My Daughter a riding mower and it was free to deliver and set up for her. They also don't give You problems if You return a product. And if You want to find out More info of veterans look on line for how many Veterans they have hired then compare it with Home Depot.

Lowe's Companies,Never thought my beloved Lowe's could be this bad,"Just had the worst experience. Tried to purchase a heat pump water heater with installation. Came to 1.9k or so. The first installer showed up without the product and before seeing where it'll be installed, tells me it can't be done.I return the water heater and called in a complaint about the waste of time since they told me it can be installed. Lowe's decided to send a different company to confirm if it's possible or not. The second company stated they can install it per code. He did say that it may fail first inspection because of how he'd run the over pressure line. I went back to Lowe's to purchase the unit and install again but first asked... If this unit is installed with code violations, am I responsible for paying to bring it up to code? Lowe's answered yes. I then called corporate and they responded with the same. So... They sell water heaters and hire companies that install with known code violations and then places the liability on the home owner? The corporate representative tried talking his way around it. His final suggestion was to maybe go somewhere else. What is that?!?!So... If you need to pull a permit for an installation that requires inspections, go somewhere else. Buying from a company that will not back their ""certified"" installers or hold them accountable for code violations, is not the best idea.",0,1

I had heard nothing about them coming to install it the week is up so I called the store and continually could not get an answer. I finally talked to someone in installations that talked to the store and they told me to come in and get a refund then purchase the right one because it was cheaper.

When I pointed out you only needed a tee square and a knife, the excuse changed to ""one of the managers might be walking around so can't do it"". There were other excuses as well such as ""didn't have a safety knife"", ""would initially have to score the sheet of drywall on a big machine prior to cutting it"". In the end, it was suggested to me that I purchase the sheet of drywall, and cut it myself in the parking lot as Lowes does not care what I do once I get out there, but that I would have to provide my own knife. I became frustrated at this point, and decided to drive across the road to Home Depot. There they cut a sheet of drywall for me and provided me with additional advice without me asking.

It is now 3/7/18 and I have scheduled a total of FIVE delivery appointments with the local San Francisco Lowe's store.

Not once did anyone try and take control of my issue and just simply make sure it got resolved. I asked to speak with department and store managers, and was once even told my issue would be escalated to the store manager who would then call me back. Five days later and that certainly hasn't ever happened and I'm sure never will.I have a significant shopping list of items for a new unit to purchase, many of which could be found at Lowe's.

I started out by looking at the order online and it stated it was delivered on November 21, 2017 but showed no shipping/delivery details. I checked my video monitor, which records all activity at my front door, for 20-22 of November. No rug was ever delivered. I went to my local store and after 45 minutes of waiting was told they can't help me since it was online order. They gave me a phone number to call. I called this weekend and was told their records show it was delivered. Since it was sent out by independent vendor, although i bought it through Lowe's and Lowe's charged my credit card, they can't do anything. She said she would send vendor email and someone should contact me from the vendor on Monday, December 18th. Monday came and went and no contact. I then noticed on my invoice they listed the address of the company that shipped the rug, no name or phone number. I did internet search by address and found the rug company and phone number. I called them on Tuesday and sure enough they had records of my order. They told me that they notified Lowe's the day after the order came in that they had cancelled the order because the rug was no longer available. They stated since the order was cancelled that Lowe's never sent them any money for the product and my issue was with Lowe's and not them.

The gentleman in the store was nice and showed us the dog doors available and helped us pick out the right size. (This required my daughter sending me pictures and me talking to the gentleman via phone because I am handicapped) When the french doors showed up, there was no dog door to be installed and the man who originally helped us was no longer there. Now I have no dog door and I can't even see out into my backyard from my chair. They insist that we need to pay for the dog door and having it installed even though we went to all of the trouble of coordinating it. We were having them put in a 6 ft vinyl fence in the back yard, but we told them to forget it We want someone dependable. I can now see why there are so many reviews about good sales people and poor management teams at Lowes. They lost a $7500 fence budget over the principle of a $130 dog door. Very Poor customer service and planning.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Pathetic company,"Pathetic company. I worked there for 7 years starting out part time to Store Manager. I left and still have friends there. It was a good company, but Robert Niblock ""aka"" Nibbles has ran this name in the ground. He cares about himself and that is it. He could care less about the employee's who keep his wallet thick.

Lowe's Companies,Lowes does not care about about long time customers.,"Had a load of lumber delivered. The straightest board on the truck was actually a ""S"" shape, the others were cracked top to bottom and side to side, warped 180 degrees, and the bottom 10% of the load contained broken boards. Before I let the truck get unloaded, I called my local Lowes, spoke to a manager after being on hold for over 45 minutes, and was told to deal with it. The driver had become impatient and started throwing things off the side of the truck in a pile and left in a toddler fit, running over what was under his tires. I took pictures and offered to send corporate a copy of the video surveillance of the drivers action and the pictures, they were not interested in hearing about the matter, I received the stand-by ""we will look into the incident"" which is code for ""oh well, your bad."". I am out almost 3k on useless lumber because this company can not take responsibility for it's lack of a quality product (hint, they cut their dimensional lumber while it is still wet, that is why it shrinks, cracks, and warps) nor for the actions of their employees. I am a contractor that has purchased from Lowes for over 10 years, but I will NEVER purchase anything from that company again, not even a single 6d nail. I have cancelled my personal Lowes Credit Card and my Lowes for Pros credit card. If you are looking for quality, this is not the company to get it from anymore.",0,1

Lowe's Companies,Shoddy products and poor customer service,"We had laminate flooring put down throughout our house 2 years ago and the nightmare still continues. For 1.5 years they came out monthly to re-glue the floors because the boards shifted and left big gaps. Then we agreed to pay more to get tile put down in the whole house. A few months ago we noticed the grout coming out. The installer showed up the morning to remove the old grout and replace it but can do nothing because stuff needs to be packed up and moved. We told Lowes that we were not moving everything this time, we have been very accommodating and moved everything both previous times. So the installer can only do one room today. Lowes has refused to take responsibility for their shoddy materials. The lack of communication is appalling.

We ask when it will deliver and she said she do not know and the driver will call when driver got time. Ask when driver will call, she said she do not know."" At around 11:20am, getting a call driver said he will deliver it at around 11:40. But at that time i am out for lunch and can not be back at 12:00. We ask to reschedule to afternoon. He said he can not reschedule to afternoon but could do it tomorrow. So we reschedule to Saturday and let us waiting between 6pm-8pm. Again nobody delivered at all after two hours waiting. We called lowers they said they can not deliver today because the stock manager didn't provide the items and he should notify us earlier before. We said he did not notify us. Clients just said sorry to us and asked me to reschedule. I just want to cancel order and client said she can not cancel but she gives us a number to call. The cancelling number i called the first person said he can not handle online order and transfer me to another line and wait around 20 minutes on the phone call and another person picks the phone and transfer me to another line and waits around another 10 minutes. My phone is finally out of power. Until now, around 6 hours of our times wastes on around 5 hours waiting and 1 hour endless phone call. Totally a waste of times. TToday I called to cancel my account again. After 40 mins waiting, I have talked to a real person finally. She told me she cannot cancel my account. Then I asked why. She said she doesn't know. She needed to check with her manager, and asked me to wait again. I was waiting for another 25 mins. The call was hung up by her. I do not want to waste one second to wait for the order or the cancellation call. I just want my money back. But for now phone is not working.",0,1

SO went in Bourbonnais Store got to payment part and they would Not take 1490.00 it would take. No cash or check. Don'T HAVE charge or credit card. This was 2 - 3 WKS AGO. Went back today bout 10:45 a.m. so I asked if I could get Lowes card , got approved for 1200.00 asked if could get raised , NO , so asked for manager if I put 500.00 cash on Gift card could I get it then. They said yes, so drove across town least 25 -30 blocks to get cash. Bought gift card so got all info together plus with free delivery got info 2 hundred foot rolls fence at 64.00 roll plus 25 fence posts. Add on another 250.00 so store lot me call Mt. Vernon store and guess what, new lowes card could be used at bourbonnais store but on line did Not have all numbers for credit card. So I asked to get 500.00 I just put on gift card and was calling my Daughter and have her go to different store WHO wants to make a sale. I probably would have to pay a delivery charge but at least she would have a rider.very frustrating, cried 3 different times. Store would not give back 500.

Lowe's Companies,Endangering Lives for a Buck!,"When I purchased a Whirlpool kitchen stove from Lowes and had it installed by Lowes' personnel, I was shocked to find that they do not check for carbon monoxide emissions on gas appliances after installation. The cost would be approximately $1,000 for the equipment which could be loaned to installers and used for years. In my situation, the kitchen stove put off nearly 750 ppm of carbon monoxide (buildings are evacuated at 25 ppm) which sent my mother to the hospital and caused the rest of us to be deathly sick. My mother died three weeks later as a result. Now, you might think that a substantial civil settlement would result. Lowes did nothing but give me the runaround. They sent me to talk to Whirlpool. Whirlpool then gave me the runaround. In fact, the woman I spoke with at Whirlpool laughed and said something like, ""This is not a million dollar claim you know!"" I did not want to sue anyone but I did talk to a lawyer about the possibility. I was told that due to the fact that my mother was elderly and had kidney and heart disease, the value of her life would be negligible. Since when have we, as a society, forgotten our moral obligation to hold companies and individuals responsible for the damage they cause? Lowes' management stopped talking to me altogether. Eventually, Whirlpool laughingly settled the claim for $5,000 which didn't even cover her funeral costs. This experience has been very traumatic for me and my family. I don't know how Lowes' management could care so little for the life they took and the devastation it has caused our family. It is difficult to understand why Whirlpool management refused to insure that quality control examined the potential for carbon monoxide emissions in their kitchen stoves before they sent them to Lowes. I will always hear the woman from Whirlpool laughing at me. I will always remember how Lowes' management treated me in the aftermath. I will always remember how little value Lowes and Whirlpool put on a human life.Every time I see my mother's picture, I remember being with her at the hospital when her kidneys shut down. We will never forget how her life tragically ended as a result of Lowes' and Whirlpool's corporate greed.",0,1

I called Lowe's again and within a short time I get a call saying the install would be 7 weeks from now. That was not acceptable. I called Lowe's and the customer service representative (Beth) told me there was nothing she could do that she sent 4 emails to the install company and got no response. Gee, thanks Beth for keeping on top of everything and following up. I asked if they had another install company and she didn't. She said she had problems with other customers so my question to Lowe's is, why are using this company to do the installs? By delaying scheduling the install for 2 weeks means several other people were put ahead of us. Lowe's should have made personal contact when they didn't get a response by email.",0,2

Lowe's Companies,Customer service hell,"Long review summary:Money paid: $7kConstruction crew delayed with no job on site for 4 days because of shipping delay.Time spent on Lowe's customer service phone line: 3 hoursNumber of personnel 'transferred to' on phone: 15Had to leave job early, drive to Lowe's store and talk to manager to get materials shipped to me.------------------------------------------------Part 1:Here is an account of how you lost a customer: I purchased over $10,000 worth of building materials online from Lowe's San Francisco. My last order was for composite decking material worth $6480. The order was supposed to ship on Monday 25th of April. I had called Lowe's to confirm this on Friday 22nd, and was told that someone would call me on Sunday evening to schedule a time for delivery. Nobody called, so I had call Lowe's back at 8 am on Monday morning. Here's what happens after that: - Wait to get connected to delivery: 10 mins - Agent tells me they can see a delivery for today, but my name is not on the 'manifest', transfers me somewhere else without informing me. - Wait another 10 mins, exceeds max waiting time, call goes back to answering machine main menu. - Wait 10 more mins to get to delivery department. - Agent again tells me my name is not on the 'manifest', transfers me to 'delivery person' - Another wait, again no one picks up, back to front menu. - After another long wait, I inform the new delivery agent that I've been on the line for 45 mins and the people who I'm being transferred to do not pick up, hearing that she decides to instead transfer to her 'manager' - Manager (name: Surend of SF Lowes) fortunately picks up, after putting me on a brief hold. Tells me I have a delivery, but it's been scheduled for Tuesday the 26th. When I asked how this could have happened with no notice to me, he has no answer. And he is unable to reschedule it for Monday, despite me calling at 8 am in the morning and spending an hour to get my delivery on time. His truck is 'already being loaded' he said. I have no confidence that this delivery will be scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday 26th. And I have no confidence left for Lowe's as a company. You can be sure that I'll avoid your business at any cost going forward.Part 2:The next day after my last email, I again had to sink an hour on Lowe's phone service line. During this process, I got transferred to random departments countless times. I have been transferred in the middle of sentences. I've been transferred to 'managers' who wouldn't pick up. I have been transferred to the receiving department, and the appliances department, who had no idea why I was transferred there.In fact, the person who called me due to your effort was calling from the appliances department, and had no information about my case, except that the delivery was not going to happen on the 26th, but the next day on Wed. 27th - again no explanation as to what happened. She transferred me to a manager who didn't pick up. A couple of hours later, the driver called me to promise me that the delivery will for sure happen on the 27th. 'If anyone else tells you', he said, 'anything can happen, but I'm the driver, when I tell you, it's for real.' I had already experienced the 'anything can happen' part, so I believed him.Unfortunately he didn't show up on Wednesday, and no one called to tell me. I again had to call and wait and be transferred to learn that my delivery was not going to happen on Wednesday. That was the last drop, I left work at 3 pm, drove an hour and a half to San Francisco to Lowe's store just to be able to talk to someone without risking being 'transferred' to oblivion. There I was able to finally have a humane conversation with asst. manager Brandon, who at least attempted to help me, arranged a driver to ship my items the next morning, who finally followed through - 4 days late. I'm only just recovering from this traumatic episode to write this response. The manager at the store actually offered my some discount, which I refused. This is laughable compensation compared to what I've been through. I'm writing with the hope that you understand how rotten your customer service is, and try to change something about it, so that other people do not have to go through what I've been through. I'm certainly planning to spend a lot of effort to make this happen, voicing my complaints in various forums and media outlets going forward.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Nice staff but horrible delivery/installation,"We have had Lowes to our home about 6 times after delivering kitchen appliance package and washer and dryer. On first trip they stated they would not install the appliances only deliver. This was not what was promised to us. Then when they arrived with to install they shared the refrigerator was not how they needed it for waterline and they would have to charge extra for the microwave, both of which was not shared at time of purchase. 4/6 appliance arrived with scratches or dents and it was not until after the 10th or more call that we were offered a 10% discount. The other piece is that no matter how many times I provided and changed our contact number the correct number was never used, somehow the contact information and the fact that we already received the replacement appliance(s) was never changed in their system. Very frustrating. Overall the sales associates were friendly but I will no longer be giving this company business due to this negative experience resulting in our project being held up, countless phone calls and extra trips to the store.",0,2

They never called back so I called back again and was told by customer service they would set it up for Saturday the day before Easter again no call so I went to the store where they told me they had lost my range delivery in the system but I could have it delivered Monday well A lot of good that did because I didn't have a stove for Easter . So I must say from top to bottom they don't have a clue what the hell they r doing .,0,1

Lowe's Companies,"Very, very, very, very poor customer service!","In July we purchased Cali Bamboo flooring from Lowe's Shakopee location. There were 2 reasons why we purchased this product from Lowes - 1) Home Depot doesn't carry this brand and 2) Tom the sales guy was so helpful. Let me say that this whole process has been a disaster and after 3 months it is still not resolved.The flooring was ordered & delivered. Lowe's admitted the error and said they would expedite the replacement shipment. The delivery took just as long as the 1st one. The flooring was installed and is beautiful however the ""custom matched"" trim ordered by Lowe's was NOT ""custom matched"" - it is a horrible white color - not anywhere near the same color as the existing natural maple trim. Unfortunately I didn't see the trim until after it was installed. We notified Lowes of the issue immediately (on Sept. 10th) and my husband took another trim sample into the store. He was told that they would have it ""custom matched"". Today is OCTOBER 15th - we still have the horrible white trim and no date from Lowes as to when the new trim will be delivered and installed. Every time I call I am told that they will call the vendor and that the vendor is very busy. Lowes has not been proactive about anything. I have had to initiate all phone calls asking for an update. On October 3rd I was told by Derek that I would get a phone call on Monday, October 6th with an update. I didn't receive a call so on Tuesday I called and left a voicemail for my contact to call me. He left me a voicemail stating ""Don't know what you wanted but assuming it is regarding the ETA of your trim"" He also said he would call me to let me know when the trim was being shipped. Still nothing. Left another message for him to call me today.I also want to mention a couple of other interactions we had with Lowes employees during the last 3 months. The day after we picked out the flooring we stopped in to place our order. Tom, our sales guy, was not in and Denny was working. He stated - not to us but to a co-worker - loud enough for us to hear - that he couldn't help us because he had to get to lunch. Nice service. Apparently the customer doesn't come first.After the delivery of the wrong flooring and before the delivery of the correct order I received a call from Lowe's asking me to rate my order,etc. He had no idea that we were still waiting for the new delivery. He also promised to call me back and never did.All in all this has been a very painful experience which still has not been resolved. I sure hope this can be resolved well before the holidays.

Lowe's Companies,Searching For Employee's Is Like Searching For Holy Grail,"The Lowes by my house is wayyyyy too understaffed. Everytime I go in there it's like i'm searching for the holy grail to find an employee to find where something is. All im looking for is a garbage can and a ladder....something that should take probably 15 min, right? 45 min. later im still standing here waiting for the guy to get done assisting another customer.",0,2
Lowe's Companies,"Beware, deceptive practices, unprofessional employees!","I went to the Lowe's store after seeing the commercial on television saying free carpet installation. What a joke, when I got there they said it was only on one type of carpet so I said ok. Continued to look and found one, perfect match for the color I needed. Very excited, I asked the salesman how much installation would be and he said they had a special for $97. I said great since my room is very small, I premeasured, 10x11. I had him ring me up and then was told I must have someone come out to measure. I told him I measured and he said it was their policy that their person must come out to measure and it would cost $41 that can be applied to the total. So once again I agreed. I didn't get a call until 2 days after to set an appointment for someone to measure. They couldn't give me the day I wanted so I agreed to their day and changed my plans. My appointment was set for Friday from 5-7 pm. I came home early from work and sat until 7:15 - no call or anything. I finally called the store and was told everyone in the department had left for the day. About 15 minutes later a gentleman called and said he was sorry but couldn't make it. I set another appointment for the next day at 7 am. He did arrive on time and when he was done told me a different size than what I had previously measured. Of course his measurements were larger, when I mentioned this he remeasured and said okay. I forgot to mention that I was told that I also had to buy padding with this carpet, even if I said my padding was still good. Once again I agreed thinking that it was such a small room it wouldn't cost me much. A few days later I called the store to see if they received the measurements and was told no. Finally someone called and said that installation would cost me almost $500. I asked if this included the cost of the carpet and was told no, that would be additional. When I said I was told $97, the salesman said that since my job was considered a small job and they needed to make money that they had an additional fee. I asked to speak to the manager and was told by the salesman that he would talk to him. When I asked him for the manager's name he told me he didn't know it, so I asked for the assistant manager's name, he only knew his first name. I had to call the store back and whoever I spoke to gave me the wrong last name of the assistant manager and also didn't know the manager's name. What's up with that? I didn't hear back and when I finally got in touch the salesman, he said his assistant manager said it was in the small print about the additional fee. I told him no where on the sales form he gave me does it say that. When I once again asked to speak to the manager, I heard him say to someone this is the lady I told you about ... When he came back on line he said no they were sticking to the high cost. I told him I wanted my money back and was told no, finally the assistant told him to refund my money. All along I'm asking to talk to the manager and no one would let me talk to him and you would think the assistant manager would also want to talk to me as proper custoer service. Nothing doing - by this time I was thinking he was quite cowardly. After hanging up, I went online and wrote a complaint to the corporate office. I received an email that someone would contact me within 24 hours and I would receive a coupon in the mail (till this day, haven't received it, not like I ever want to buy something from this store again. But you would think the corporate office wouldn't fib!) Anyway, I finally got to talk to the assistant manager. He told me the salesman never explained to him my situation and that if he did it could have been worked out. I told him by then I had already contacted another company to do my carpeting and also do my wood flooring. He was understanding but not very apologetic for their poor customer service. I was also told that I needed to come back to the store to get my refund. I said ok even if it was out of my way. When I got to the store, I thought the assistant manager would at least have the decency to come out, nothing doing the girl had to call him in the office and she was told to take care of it. Now, I am finally thoroughly disgusted with the lack of professionalism and cowardice this man is displaying. I say nothing, thank the girl who helped me and call the manager the next day to explain how it would have been nice to get some customer service from his assistant, etc. However, speaking to the manager he told me he had no idea what I was talking about, he couldn't explain why no one knew his name and on top of that he tod me he would talk to his assistant when he came in that day -- I had to inform him that his assistant was off for the next two days, he told me to wait so he could check the schedule. When he came back on the line he said yeah ... Not one apology or anything. I cannot understand how such a large company that relies on customer service to build its business can have such untrained personnel. I have vowed not to buy another thing from lLowes, ever again. Once I started telling my story to others, they also had their own similar stories about Lowes.",0,1
Lowe's Companies,Pricy but affective,"A week or so ago I was in our local Lowe's in Lenoir, NC. I purchased some items for plumbing, several of the same in size and price. There were no sku's, the cashier replied gruffly ""YOU HAVE TO GO GET ME A SKU"". I am sorry but I do not get paid to do anyone's job. I replied call the department and get it. She did but described the wrong item, ask for pvc, it was cpvc, which I showed her. Her attitude became more inflamed. I informed her there were no more I wanted them all. I walked back to the department got the empty box brought it to her and she still complained. The man in the plumbing dept. came up and told her that it was cpvc, not pvc. They have different prices. (Just as I told her).Finally I had to request a manager. It was all totally uncalled for. To top it all off she denied it all. Luckily I had someone with me.So it has come to customers doing everything, purchasing, price checking as well as paying, If that's the case you no longer need employee's. Pricy",0,1
