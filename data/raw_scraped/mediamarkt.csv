MediaMarkt,Bad Customer Service Experience,"I had just recently (April 2021) very bad experience with MediaMarkt as well as their delivery service. For one delivery, it took four tries of scheduled appointments, about 6 phone calls with customer service and the day of delivery when I got confirmation to receive my items that day over the phone, later the same day I also got an email about one of the item being returned and canceled. So when I called yet again customer service as I was very confused about their email communication, I was being handled very unfriendly and still did not get a clear answer. After the customer service representative literally not letting me finish a sentence and hanging up on me at the end, I called back and after speaking to another person, I cancelled my order as I was clearly not appreciated and not treated with respect. Their prices are not the best and there are other competitors such as Cool Blue for example that are handling customers much better and with more respect. Think twice before you spend your money with MediaMarkt. I will not do the same mistake twice.",0,1
MediaMarkt,Don't buy product from mediamarkt/Worst…,"Don't buy product from mediamarkt/Worst customer service We ordered a product via mediamarkt online store on 13 March 2021 and received a defective piece, which we got to know when we opened the product for check. Within the said Excahnge & Return period we processed it to the exchange thing. Initially they said we crossed the 14 days of Exchange & Return period and when we gave them proofs then they started telling that we have used the product whilst we only opened it to check whether all parts are available and working fine or not. Later they claimed that this product doesn't belongs to Return and Exchange category and beacuse we have already opened it from the actual packaging, they can not exchange it. Also now it only can be repaired and asked for 15 working days of time to wait. We compromised with this statement and waited for 25 days. After being chased via online chat, emails and customer service calls, we are still not getting any satisfactory answer, leaving the product. I would urge every potential and current customer of mediamarkt to think before buying any product from these fraudsters. They are only interested in your hard earn money and not the customer satisfaction. I will post this to each and every social media platform so that maximum people will get into their notice before giving their precious money in the hands of fraudsters like mediamarkt.",0,1
MediaMarkt,Not return even if the product doesn't work,"I bought a hair clipper which didn't work , I returned the item to the store but they refused to take it, unlike mentioned in their policy they don't refund , they gave me another of the same model and said ""I hope this will work"", they aren't even sure that the product they sell actually works...otherwise i ve been scammed",0,1

MediaMarkt,NEVER buy anything from this company or…,NEVER buy anything from this company or you'll regret if any problem happens! Horrible customer service beyond words! My card was charged €600 due to their system glitch and yet they chose to ignore my calls and emails. Its been 3 weeks and almost a month now!

MediaMarkt,Terrible customer service,I ordered a product from mediamarkt on the 11/12/2020 and to this day the product is yet to arrive. Whilst this is not completely the fault of mediamarkt and actually postnl themselves I was still shocked at the customer service I received and having to wait almost 2 months to get my money back and only due to the fact that I called and emailed multiple times. What frustrated me was that when I called after the parcel having quite obviously lost in the post I was told that the packet will actually arrive on the day I called however the customer support lady clearly knew this was a lie. I was also told by email after having waited a week for an answer that I should have received my package according to them when it still was no where to be seen.Whilst I am not blaming them for the parcel never being delivered and I believe this is the fault of postnl I do believe that their customer service is very unprofessional.,0,1
MediaMarkt,Black hole of inefficiency and incompetence,"Like all the other people who have wrote a review here, I can also say that my experience with this company has been horrible. I had a problem with an order (84860586, placed on 25th March on their website) which has been only partially refunded, when they should have refunded me the entire amount.. No explanation for that, almost impossible to get someone from the customer service, when I got one, she was very rude and uninterested. Their Facebook page is a joke. Many promises they would get back to me, it never occurred. They justify all delays with "" it's because of the Corona""... how pathetic.. they should be simply be ashamed of themselves.. Really, never buy on line with them , unless you want to be sucked in their black hole of inefficiency and incompetence.",0,1

MediaMarkt,Disaster online shopping and customer service,I ordered a laptop online and the web page was saying that I was going to receive it in 3-4 days. However I didn’t. I tried to get in touch with the customer service and they told me I had to wait one week more because they didn’t have it. The lady told me to cancel and ask for a refund instead of compensating the waste of my time and money. I urgently needed that computer for my own company. I lost more than a week and everything will get harder and cost me time. Thanks for the insolence,0,1
MediaMarkt,Online order is completly disaster,The Home delivery is completly unorganized. I ordered a laptop from online store and after two days I received mail that the order is cancelled because it was not in the store. The website has nothing clearly mentioned which one is available and which one not. Later I called and they mention that the laptop is not available on the nearest store. When I mention that I order for a standard delivery from online store they can not answer why they cancel my order. Now I am waiting for my payment pack and God knowes when I will receive the amount... It's simply a DISASTER for MEDIAMARKT.,0,1

MediaMarkt,Straight-Up Fraud,"One morning(10am) I ordered around 100 euros worth of stuff, nothing crazy, but i specifically selected same day shipping and paid extra for this service. The evening comes around and nothing arrives, i call, they tell me they have no idea where it even is. I call the next day to ask where it is, turns out it has been in THE SAME CITY the whole time but they still havent moved it out of inventory. Frankly they are absolute frauds, they offer services they know they will not provide and expect the customer to deal with it when they fail to provide it. They promise me a 3 euro refund and that the package might arrive next week while still providing no actual useful information. Please order elsewhere if you want legitimate service, hopefully bol.com or others serve you well. Good luck.",0,1

MediaMarkt,"Product sold as new, missing items.","This concerns MM in the Netherlands. I ordered a monitor for my laptop which arrived and had obviously been opened previously as the seals had been broken and the HDMI cable was missing. I spoke to customer service and they told me I could return it and pick up a new one. I asked if they could not just send me a new/different HDMI cable, but they said I had to return the item/exchange it. I am sure they could have made this easier for me, but they would not. Hence the two star review. Surely it is easier to mail me a cable rather than having me drive 30 minutes there and 30 mins back due to their fault...?",0,2

MediaMarkt,"broken washing machine, by far the worst service","By far the worst service I have ever experienced.My advice, do not make the same mistake and order from media markt.I ordered a washing machine one month ago and a broken washing machine was installed. To summarise, we still don't have a working washing machine and did not get our money back. We have been calling for I don't know how many times. The waiting time is outrageous and since we still don't have a working washing machine all this time was basically a waste. We thought today we would finally get one delivered, however people only came to pick up the broken machine. Now, we are not even receiving answers to all the emails we sent, nor did we get our money back or have a working washing machine.I am very very disappointed with this terrible service.",0,1
MediaMarkt,Very bad service after-sales wise,Very bad service after-sales wise. Delivered washingmachine had installation included within a deal. When they delivered it they left without installing it as they forgot to mention it on the order (they admitted this).Now 2 years and a few month later the machine is having technical issues and I'm asked to pay full repairing costs. In the Netherlands we have these laws which point at Decent product life. They completely ignore these and insist me on paying nonetheless. Never buying anything here again....,0,1

After charging the laptop for more than 20 hours, battery is still 0% and laptop can work max 40 sec. They gave me the option to repair the laptop. To repair brand new laptop??

I suggested the option to circumvent this issue by me translating the original document and reading it myself, while signing it in the current language (knowing what it says I could sign any document in any language). They rudely declined in person and normally declined by email without even discussing a case that would cost the company 3-4K (with monthly payments this would have gone even higher or even considering future purchases etc.).I am convinced that I am not the only case that has occured in a multi-national country and a multi-national company, not to mention that many would argue that this discrimination is borderline racist!Hope someone sees that and take action, cause it is definately not a good practice and most certainly not a good image for the company itself.",0,1

So we came through several circles of hell. First we went to the service department, the girl said it's impossible to get the installation, then we came to the man in the department of the washing machines in the store and he said ok, i'll do the apointment. We paid 20 euros for it, waited till the date he said they will come. Nobody came. Went back to the store to know what's wrong, he said they will call on Monday. Nobody called. Went back to store, they said in the customer department there is no appointment even created. And he created for us an appointment for installation. No confirmation on email, no calls, nobody came. Now we have to return the washing machine, because I can't lift it on the 3rd floor and install it. And it's much easier to return it, than just to get someone come and install it. Just ridiculous.",0,1

In the end I received my parcel much later than what was promised on the website and I still have not heard from customer service, although they state on their website that it takes them about an hour to reply to messages sent through social media. I strongly recommend ordering products from any other shop before opting for MediaMarkt.",0,1

MediaMarkt,"competitive prices, but total lack of client service","Tried to buy a washing mashing from them, only worked for the second time, because their delivery company refused to unpack the washing machine downstairs in order to fit in through the door. They returned it back to base, and I spend in total about 2-3 hours on hold listening to the music waiting for MediaMarkt on-call personnel to respond. The call was dropped from the queue twice after waiting for 20-30 minutes. Worst of all I was promised twice that my problem is going to be resolved and my first order is going to be re-delivered for me. In the end I just got refunded (and still waiting for the money back from the first order). I got no response from facebook or twitter communication channels. This was simply the worst ever experience of retail shopping for me. So I had to buy the same washing mashing again(!). Second time lucky the delivery team worked as expected.",0,1
MediaMarkt,Deliberately sold a product that's actually out of stock.,"I ordered a TV online - they said delivery time would be within 3-5 days. A few days later I receive an e-mail that the item is actually out of stock, and will be restocked at a date in the past(???). They kept selling the item within the days up until the e-mail, which shows they deliberately sold it while it was out of stock.I call customer service to get an answer on why the restock date is in the past - they have no clue and said they would contact their back office colleagues and e-mail me by the end of the day - they never did. I try calling again - they don't pick up.If I try to cancel the order, I would get my money back within a week, so I will be unable to buy from a competitor in time by Black Friday, meaning my best bet is to wait on them. Seeing as they did this deliberately to lock me in with a purchase, shows how predatory they are towards consumers.Luckily, less and less people buy from them, and their stock is plummeting, so they will eventually go bankrupt. Just wish I had read these reviews before I purchased the item.",0,1

MediaMarkt,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. After ordering and paying for an LG fridge from the Portuguese branch of this company, they informed me 2 days later via email, the fridge was ""on the way"" They do NOT give you the option to choose WHEN it will be delivered. It is just ""on the way"" I called to ask to select a time, they said no, their ""policy is to deliver the first time between 0800 and 2000"" (on the day of their choosing) They then stated ""if you aren't available, you can then choose a separate time"". As they were going to deliver on a Saturday when I was walking from home giving online classes, I asked them to choose another day. They were completely and utterly inflexible. They kept saying it was their policy and refused to use any common sense whatsoever. Additionally this policy is horrific for the environment. Driving around on the offchance the customer ""might"" be at home. They told me I would receive a notification 30 minutes before via text that it would arrive. I did not. Their terms had stated that my old fridge has to be disconnected if I wanted them to take it. As I am diabetic and keep medicine in the fridge, I was waiting to at least know the time of arrival to limit having no fridge. They did not tell me, so when they arrived they said they couldn't take the old fridge, but to call and schedule another time no problem. Obviously, they were lying, or the company are liars. Or both. When I called the company, they told me because I had accepted the delivery and the other fridge wasn't ready (regardless of the fact it wasn't ready because I didn't know what time the new one would arrive) they absolutely refused point blank to pick up the old fridge. The thing that shocked me the most about this whole process is the complete and utter lack of any kind of customer service. For a company of this size, you would think after receiving two calls from totally frustrated customers, they would just come and pick the old fridge up. I now have to get this old fridge up two flights of stairs and into the street by myself. completely impossible.But they do not give any thought to after care. I cannot stress strongly enough how this company should be avoided at all costs.",0,1

It took over a month for the repair to happen, then after half a day of working on it the repairman announced he could not fix it without extra parts so it took another 1,5 weeks and he came back again. He said it was fixed. It was broken (again) after drying for 10 minutes. I call mediamarkt because I just want to get a new machine now instead of waiting 5,5 weeks again. So i call and the machine says they are busy and they can call back if you leave your number. I left my number and they never called, 5 days later i call and leave my number again, they never call back. Terrible service. I now just fixed it myself... for now..

MediaMarkt,"Terrible customer service, terrible return process, delivery is simply bad.","Pros: It's a shop.Cons: Customer service is unreachable for days.No reply on the homepage chat, twitter, facebook. My experience with buying a fridge:- Delivery organized by mediamarkt was terrible, they did not bring the fridge up to the 2nd floor but left it at the apartment building door. That was not communicated. - Fridge itself has a low quality in relation to the price. - Return process is painful. I want to return the fridge, but the customer service is plainly not responding for DAYS. I tried 3 different social media channels and did not receive a reply. I tried to contact them during working hours. - Don't know yet if I'll manage to return the fridge because until now, it's been impossible to arrange the pickup. Points to improve:- a working customer service would be great.- automate the return process so customers don't need to wait for days to arrange a return pickup.- delivery of heavy items should be to the apartment door, not the apartment building door. - delivery should take the package of big items. In comparison, doing a similar process at coolblue for example is super smooth, takes a few clicks, no need to wait for days for a customer service agent to respond. All in all, a frustrating experience.Only for this reason, I will not choose nor recommend mediamarkt for purchasing bigger items next time.",0,1

I've put a screen protected on my new phone on 25-07-2020 in MediaMarkt on Boschdijktunnel 1 in Eindhoven. After 2 months the screen protector started going out, because the job they did was very poor quality. And now they're not accepting any responsibility for the poor quality service which they provided and they're saying that the quarantee for screen protectors is only 2 weeks. This is an attitude of a typical scammer, who is cheating its clients instead of providing them acceptable service. This last experience convinced me of one thing: if you don't want to be cheated, never set a foot in a MediaMarkt shop again.",0,1

MediaMarkt,Mediamarkt Scam!,"I bought a brand new Samsung refrigerator form Mediamarkt. I chose that specific model because it was coming with a cordless vacuum cleaner as a ""gift!"". I paid €1500 in total. After the purchase, I figured the price was divided into 2 items in the invoce; the fridge was around 1000 euros and the vacuum cleaner was around 400 euros. I did not care because the total amount was the same.After we powered the fridge on, we figured it does not work as it should. I called an official Samsung service, they came to my house and agreed that it has to be changed. I called Mediamarkt, arranged a return because they did not have the same model in their warehouse at that moment. So I decided to have my money back. Mediamarkt also told me that the vacuum cleaner was a gift coming together with the fridge, so I have to return it together with the fridge. I agreed and packed it up as they told me and handed it over to the same guy who got the fridge myself.After a few days, I had around 1000 euros back in my account. It was exact same amount written for the fridge on the invoce. So, I figured they returned the money for the fridge but the vacuum cleaner. I called Mediamarkt right away and told them I also returned the vacuum cleaner as they told me. First, they told me it was their mistake, they initiated the process and the rest of the money will be in my account within 3 working days. After 3 days I had nothing! (suprise!) Then, I called them again and sent them emails over and over again for 2 months. Answer was always the same: they are working on it. And today, after 2 months, they told me that there is no vacuum cleaner in their warehouse, they talked to the driver who took the fridge and he told them he did not get any vacuum cleaner, he only got the fridge!Now I am in a position that looks like I am lying to them! I do not know if it is lost or stolen but I am pretty sure that I gave the vacuum cleaner to the guy. Name of the driver and the exact date of the delivery is written in their system but they cannot do anything about it but saying they are sorry.This is a SCAM!

For one hour they tested the printer, they made several printouts and printed the same colored print that I brought with me and it showed even a worse result.They sent me to the returns & exchange section, the guy was already angry, he got me waiting for another 30 minutes, then when I told him I wanted to return the printer or exchange it he yelled in Turkish, saying that it's opened he can't return it. I showed him the poor quality print out, he kept saying: You opened it I can't return it, even though it was in full packing.I asked to speak to a manager, he said he was the manager. I told him I want to complain, he kept saying there's nothing I can do about it. I told him: I'm going to leave the printer I'm not taking it with me, or you find me someone to talk to. He yelled: OK keep it no problem! So I just left it there and left the shop! They have the printer and my money!",0,1
MediaMarkt,Terrible Reparation service,"I bought a mobille phone Samsung I had a problem, cause some app was overwarming the phone. So I was to the shop, the mobile was in guarantee. They said me that considering I had a small defect in the screen I had to pay the whole reparation- 108 euro. But this defect was 6 months earlierWhen i told to the customer service of the shop in Mataro in Spain, a boy from mediamarket said me they never trust the customers. I was very surprise to hear that. I never will buy more in a place where i don't trust them. I will buy in amazon where if i have a problem they repair me the phone and do not miss respect like they do in mediamarket",0,1
MediaMarkt,Awful,"Apperantly customer service doesn't answer the phone, respond to their twitter DM's and when i finally got to talk to an employee on the official website. He told me the product i ordered which they cancelled because it wasn't in their inventory, which i know isn't true seeing how i was in Alkmaar last week and i saw plenty of the headphones i ordered. But to double check i looked up if i could pick it up at their store in Alkmaar and i could. Then the employee claimed he looked wrong and something went wrong with my order, i'm taking my business elsewhere where i won't have to do this much trouble to order a headset!",0,1
MediaMarkt,Worst customer service ever!,"They advertise products that they don't have. I've been waiting for almost 2 weeks to refund me the amount I paid for something they cancelled and it is still available on their website - two weeks later.

MediaMarkt,They are avoiding giving me the refund they owe me!,"I bought a dryer which was defective. They collected it and sent me an email to confirm I would get a refund. It has now been three weeks and they still not have refunded my money! I have received 3 emails asking me for my bank details from 3 different people who seem not to communicate with each other. I have phoned up and went in store to complaint and see what if anyone could help in vain. This is outrageous and a scandal. I will have to lodge a complaint with the Consumentenbond, seek legal action and report them for fraud! I will never shop with them again!",0,1
MediaMarkt,Worst shop for electronics ever...,"Guys,please don't buy anything from the shop ever again.I see a lot of people had problems with delievery or the reparing service,I never used any of that so I can't say anything about it.BUT...the prices in the shop are so un-accurate that you can order the same items from Amazon for double the price cheaper.2 years ago when I was didn't look where is the cheapest price I came in the shop(dad said it was a very good shop for electronics) in Austria and bought some items,Razer nommo chroma speakers,Razer mouse bungee,Logitech G Pro X headphones and a Razer headset stand(the one without RGB).The speakers cost 130$ which is okay because If I ordered the speakers from Amazon or some America shop the price would be a lot more because of the delievery.It was the same for the headphones and the mouse bungee,the price was ok.Now,the headset stand WITH RGB from Razer costs 50 DOLLARS on Amazon or any other shop in my country...The price for the NO RGB version in MediaMarkt was FIFTY EUROS.....When i noticed that 2 months after the purchase I was really angry.I am not bothering to come to the shop and ask them for a refund because I live in Croatia and it is not worth it to come there..When i was on their online shop the other day I noticed that a lot of the prices aren't accurate so please gus when you are buying something first check the price on the company page.Thank you and have a nice day..",0,1
MediaMarkt,Customer service simply does not care.,"Customer service simply does not care.I made an order for five things at their shop in Utrecht. As we asked for the fridge and washing machine to be delivered, we also added a coffee machine and 2 more small items. The fridge and washing machine arrived as scheduled but three other items were missing. We were told by the delivery service that they don't know about other items. Well, so the other items should be delivered by post NL. We were not informed about it at the shop but told 'sure you can add it to the delivery.' Now more than one week passed and the items are still missing. I have called the customer service but was simply ignored and was told that the shop will contact me within 24 hours. Three days passed and no one contacted me. I'm on my phone for the third time trying to sort out the order.",0,1

MediaMarkt,"Paid&Never Delivered 1MONTH. €,-300 MINUS","The worst so far. I have been to the store and buy a product that was not even coming anymore since a while. I came to know all of this when I went back to store one month later because in this 30+days I called atleast three times. 1. First time I called because my email was incorrectly written on the receipt, they fixed it. I also asked if the product would take more than one month to be delivered ""She said of course not it will take two weeks"".2. Second call after 2 weeks. I get on the phone a women and she said she will contact the store for clarification on my product. (supposed to get an email message) but this did not happen.3. My last call. I was already getting pissed of because they never called or send an email. This time a guy picked up and I told him I order a product on 6 May and till this day I did not hear nothing about it and I would like to know what has happened? He responds ""I will check for you and I will come back, pls wait"" When he came back on the line and told me there is a ""Connection malfunction"" if I want try later again.At this time I went to the Arena shop again and I get to know by an employee that they are not receiving the product I order anymore. He suggested me to cancel the order because one month is too much, So I did.I cancelled the order at the shop. One day later I get the money back they way I have paid the INVISIBLE product.And the most surprising situation is that the day after of cancelling the order they called me on private number saying ""I saw you have cancelled the order but we just received one again and that is why I am calling you to offer this"" AT THIS MOMENT I WAS DONE WITH THIS BLS. Would definitely recommend everyone to spare your time because their service is a waste of time. Time consuming for a none worth situation.I am not the first nor the last.",0,1

The thing is that the phone was available and in stock. There were 60 items that became 4 that suddenly became 1..... are you kidding me or what?

MediaMarkt,*Never* use this website,"*Never* use this website. First of all, the object wasn’t as described at all. (A “mobile” AC unit that was actually a window unit. You need to open your window and tape it up. I have indoor cats so that’s not an option for me.)So then I contacted them for a return, via message (they started to listen then ignored me) and via email. They got back to me over a week later. The first message said “we’ll be up on the 17th we’ll tell you what time.” Great, right? Except 3 minutes later they were like “oh no we’re only picking up TVs, can’t help you.”Their policy tells you that they’d pick up heavy items. The AC unit is he sure than any TV. (29.5Kg, 1.5m tall.) I pointed they out and their reply was “can’t help.”So their policy is 100% false advertisement.Of course I can’t carry it hence why I bought it online, but they don’t care. I opened a PayPal case because they simply refuse to pick it up.",0,1

When they delivered it they left without installing it as they forgot to mention it on the order (they admitted this).Now 2 years and a few month later the machine is having technical issues and I'm asked to pay full repairing costs.

Just because I’m a brown woman, stupid Dutch employees following me around the shop, everywhere I went, until I got tired of it and left the shop without buying anything. Still, they followed me to the exit. They are just racists who always think brown people have no money and just go to the shops to steal.

The lady told me that they will pick up the phone and provide me with the new one within 14 days. In the era of smartphones, there is no way anyone could wait for two weeks to get a new phone. Somehow, we negotiated that a new phone will arrive much faster. But, after 2 days I received an email that my money for the phone will be transferred back within 14 days. I contacted customer services again through phone and email. But no one gave me any answer regarding their decision on returning money rather than providing a new phone as was asked. I would never buy from MediaMarkt again and would tell anyone I know not to buy from this company.",0,1

MediaMarkt,They have one of the worst customer services,"They have one of the worst customer services I ever had experienced.It is very common to get rude people on the phone on customer service.Last time, I ordered several appliances to a new house I bought. I contacted before to ask if I could schedule the delivery because I would be moving only in a few week. They said that they would never deliver anything before contacting me on the phone to schedule the delivery - this was normal procedure. This went wrong and they delivered my stuff to the house before I moved there and before ever contacting me to set a day.When I contacted on the phone, I explained the situation and politely asked them to collect the items back and deliver only in a few weeks.The person on the phone said that everything was my fault. ""She"" never told me that MediaMarkt would contact me before delivery (it was not ""her"" fault) and I ""shouldn't be such an irresponsible person because I gave an address where I was not living there yet"". After a lot of discussion she suddenly hang up. They never solved the problem.Another time, they guaranteed me that the installation of a washing machine was included in the price. However, they ""forgot"" to mention that they send a company to do that, which have orders to not do anything if they think they might damage the machine, for example if they have to carry the machine through a tight spot (although it fits well, as I had to do it...). After I protested that, they said it was their policy. I said that they should be clear about it and put that information somewhere to be seen (which is not anywhere to be found). They refused.These were the last problems I had. I had many before, but I will stop buying anything from there and recommend everyone I know to do the same. It's a terrible company, I don't know how they still have customers.",0,1

MediaMarkt,The washing machine repair - the Odyssey,"I ordered a washing machine on December 2019 and it started leaking in March 2020. I asked for repair or replacement and they said that due to Covid-19 they cannot send a technician at home. Therefore, we agreed with the customer service that they will pick it up and repair it at their service points.As a result, they picked it up and informed me 2 days after that they cannot fix it but they will send a technician!!! I managed to arranged an appointment with the technician one month after customer service informed me about the incapability of fixing in from the first place.Long story short, I still wait from MediaMarkt to send me back the washing machine. I have called the customer service too many times and they either found Covid excuses or they said they will immediately arrange it and send it back to me. Next week it's the appointment with the technician and it looks like I am going to miss it... I've been around 1 and a half month without my washing machine. No further comment.",0,1

I am aware of the nintendo switch being sold out everywhere and them being out of stock, however mediamarkt had them in stock again after a while, so I ordered one.Paid 409 euros via paypal and mediamarkt says it will be delivered within 3 days. On day 3, not only did it not arrive but I have never heard from mediamarkt again. I got an order confirmation that states the 3 day delivery time, but never received a shipment confirmation. So I decide to contact the customer support and ask about my order. I was told the product I bought is out of stock and I'd have to wait several weeks from now on until I'd be able to receive my order. In regards of cancelling my order they told me I'd be able to do that, however I'd have to wait up to TWO MONTHS to receive my 409 euros back. So my only 2 options are to wait months for my order or to wait months for my money back. No compensation mentioned. When I asked for possible compensation I was told that there MAY be a possibility of a refund once I receive my order (months in the future), which after all this scammery I'm sure would not be an option in the first place.Absolutely disappointed and disgusted by these practices.

I was furious and very confused as I have never received the package, so why would it be returned without my permission? So I contacted the customer service again to ask for a reason, they could not provide me of any. Now I know it is not the customer service's fault, so I did not blame them, but I am furious that the company has not even provided me of a reason or any compensation. I will definitely not buy again from this company and hopefully they will return my money sometime soon. Really don't recommend.

This was the second time we were there for the same product.The staff member that was assisting us at first was obviously new to the job and couldn't be of much help. He also had really poor personal hygiene (there's a reason I'm mentioning this, read on).A female employee came to help after we went to at least another 2 employees for help. She looked, we felt, very uninterested and acted in an arrogant and disrespectful way towards us.We eventually needed to sort an issue with installments over the phone by calling MediaMarkt's bank partner and we placed the bank clerk on speaker for better communication across all sides.The male MediaMarkt employee took my phone, without my permission, and placed it on his ear to speak with the bank clerk even though she was already on speaker and could be heard just fine, which was an incredibly irresponsible decision on his end, with Corona virus still in full swing.I asked for sanitizer to clean my phone, they had none. I placed the phone in a plastic glove. As for the computer? They told us we cannot help you get it and said go somewhere else.

I got two confirmations that it got cancelled and money will be returned asap and the order wont be send out and if any updates they would let me know. Saturday went by and nothing heard from Mediamarkt. Saturday night I get a mail in my spam from the delivery company Dynalogic. That they'll deliver tomorrow and I have to be home at 8am till 18:00pm. Sunday passes and I was 1 min outside and in that 1 minute they went at my door while no dogs were barking so its bit unbelievable. I mailed them to cancel my order and not come by the next day since it has to be returned to Mediamarkt asap. This morning I receive mail that they ordered the delivery guy to cancel my order and got new mail that they already send my parcel back to Mediamarkt.

Its sad to see u wanna cancel order blabla.'I thought Mediamarkt support was better since the live chats and all but unfortunately they only have become worse and very late with the updates on products. The same phone is now 20 euro discounted, which is also unbelievable that they have a sudden sale. Ridiculous. I thought it be nice to buy phone and other electronics from there so you can easily return products but it's all a BIG drama and the only thing they see is MONEYYYYYY.

It makes no difference if you contact them on messenger or by phone, they just make up a story that the issue is being dealt with and hope that you go away! Try speaking to a manager or someone with any sort of seniority in the company and you are wasting your time. There are some serious issues with the way this company treats it's online customers, I will personally never deal with them again once this sorry dispute is closed!",0,1
MediaMarkt,Ordered a washing machine.,"Ordered a washing machine.At the checkout, I was given the option to choose the date of delivery (and installation), which was extremely important for me.

MediaMarkt,Worst service ever,"Store itself is as any Mediamarkt fine with a wide range, however NEVER use their 'service'. I ordered a dish-washer and just about everything went wrong with this. It took over a month to have the machine working at home. Had to call myself (was told I would be called for an appointment), was promised that first the delivery would take place and then the installation (on the same day), but of course, the installation guy called before the delivery. Mediamarkt wrote that I had to go to the store and if my story was correct I'd get a refund of the 79 euro I paid for the 'service', which apparently is in their eyes the same as a gift-card of 25 euro. After complaining bumped up to 40 euro but still no 79. Worst 'service' I ever experienced.",0,1

We kept on being passed from one department to the next and then back to the same departments again! It took 1 hour and 30 minutes to buy a TV, ridiculous.The TV is meant to be delivered today but we just received an email saying they don’t have it in stock. I will never go there again.

MediaMarkt,MediaMarkt has my money,"MediaMarkt has my money and stopped answering my e-mails.On Black Friday I bought 2 items at MediaMarkt Online store: a Soda Stream and a Nespresso Machine. The first product was delivered with no problems. The second one was delayed. I received an e-mail saying it would be delivered next day. I stayed all day, even though I had many places to go. At night, since I hadn’t received yet, I checked the track and it said they tried to deliver it, but there was nobody home, which I didn’t understand it all (when something cannot be delivered in person for any reason, they usually leave a paper on the mailbox to certificate they tried but they didn’t obtain any success).I tried to contact MediaMarkt on the phone, but the waiting was very long, so I decided to go to the store, at the Help Desk, and understand what happened. The shop assistant didn’t look pleased to help me and said there would be nothing she could do, since I bought the product online and not at the store. She advised me to call MediaMarkt and explain my situation.I got home and did what they advised me. The lady on the phone checked and found out that on the day I supposed to have my Nespresso Machine delivered, the transport had a problem and couldn’t had it done. She explained that when something like this happens, they usually try to deliver it again, which didn’t happen. The assistant said that by the end of that day, I would get an e-mail with a new delivery day, but the only e-mail I got was MediaMarkt trying to understand what happened and saying they didn’t know when I would have it delivered. After some days, I told them I wanted to cancel my order and have my money back. After that, they never replied me anymore.I’ve been waiting more than a month and since I didn’t receive my purchase at all and MediaMarkt refuses saying what happened or canceling my order, I’m wondering how much money they make by fooling the clients, having their money but not delivering the products.That was my first and my last experience at MediaMarkt and I advise you not to buy anything there, since it isn’t an honest store at all.",0,1

Yesterday I got a call from the delivery woman asking me to come pick up the delivery. She was 500 meters from my house! I said, she can easily park on the street in front of my door, so I can carry the heavy items to my flat. Then she just disappeared. I tried to call her, and finally, after 5 calls she picked up and said there were more important orders, so she did not deliver mine...(She was 500 meters away and just left.. and did not pick up her phone anymore. When I tried to call again she hanged up on me and blocked my number!. I am taking off for Christmas in few days and I don't know where or when my delivery will arrive.

I previously emailed MediaMarkt's head office of some of the other incidences that had occurred, without a reply!

The laptop broke after a month. We were told to send it to it's company. After waiting for a few weeks, we got it back. Now the keyboard is broken. MediaMarkt wouldnt take it back or replace it. The dishwasher rusted out and made funny noises and was showing an unusual code. Service was called 3 times. It was repaired but still not working.They will not take it back or replace it.

Well, I have made an order from MediaMarkt...tried paying, it never went through, kept getting some error404. After 2 days they sent me an automated email, saying that their security systems refused my order. So I tried once more after getting these messages, this time using my direct credit card for payment instead of PayPal. This time order went thru, they sent me a ""Thank you for your order"" message, but then some hours later again I get a message that their systems detected some problem and thus my order is rejected. This was AFTER the payment was already taken from my card :( :(Very-very bad customer service :-/",0,1

I took it again. 2 weeks later I was informed I could fetch it. I collected it after waitin one hour. On arriving home the language had been changed to Spanish. It was impossible for me to get my program back including Google Chrome and Skype ( where the other party on Skyping could not hear me) . I was advised that reprogramming it would cost €49.00 . I had originally paid this and refused. I asked for a manager. Eventually one came and started reprogramming. Not much was said or explained. He then walked off and one of the other attendants then helped. He spoke good English. Why did the first assistant Xavi did not call him? This was unprofessional causing unnecessary aggravation. Jack then completed task efficiently and without further problems. It took five trips in total from 20 Kilometers away. Hans De Leeuw,0,1

Avoid any purchase here.","Mediamarkt Den Haag sold me a product with defect and they don't want to exchange or refund the money. 4th of June of 2018 I've purchased the Washing machine LG FH4U2VCN2 for €555,00. It was on discount with €100 because it was the last one left (this was the only information they gave). I paid in total €235 because I've signed for 2 promos (Budget Energie contract -€150 and Ziggo internet contract -€200), plus I've purchased a water filter for €30.No one informed me that product was defected (or even it had visual defects). On Saturday 9th of June the delivery stuff brought washing machine in my house and installed it. After that they decide to switch on to check if it's working. After 1-2 minutes water started leaking and washing machine stopped working. The courier saw it and said that the washing machine is dead, and that I have to contact the customer support number of mediamarkt Den Haag, where it was purchased (0703306489), and because the courier was in hurry he abandoned me with not working item that I purchased as new, and with lots of water on the floor that I had to clean not to damage the wooden laminate floor.From first call the customer support of mediamarkt demonstrated their unpoliteness and incompetence. They promised to give an answer within 24h and after 24 hours they lied that they did not promise this, so I have to wait another 24 hours. By this they are winning time to take my rights on product return within 14 days. Also they are constantly repeating that I have no any rights to return or refund the washing machine, because it is a showroom model. No one aware us about this, the only information we had is that this is last item left in stock. I repeat - last model in stock and showroom model that you cannot return are two different things. At the end, the maximum they can do is to repair it by warranty which is completely not acceptable for me. If the washing machine will be repaired before I used it, that means it is factory refurbished and should cost much less. I paid for new product. The refurbished product will have damages inside, it is unreliable and in future It will be hard for me to sell it. Given the fact it was in showroom, I accept the cosmetic state of the product (few scratches on front panel, and small signs everywhere). But selling not working washing machine as new, without ability to return it - is a gross violation of consumer rights and fraud. Why such big electronics network do this?",0,1

The half knowledged customer service agent explained the specs of the HP laptop to us,when we decided to go ahead with the purchase on an EMI basis,then at the payment counter we were asked if we had the knowledge of Dutch language as the contract would be typed in it.We did inform to media markt that in the past we had purchased items from the same store without any defaulting to the emi payments.But the store manager repeatedly told us that it was a new rule introduced a month ago.What is clearly vissible here is the pathetic approach of the ""dutch"" employees towards the skilled non dutch immigrants working in Global MNC's.IF IT IS A RULE,MAKE IT COMMON FOR ALL.We would have easily given all the required bank documents to Media markt required for the product purchase,but sorry to say that the organization has rolled out rules only for the localites even if they would default the payments in future and not for the non dutch skilled immigrants who are ready to provide documents at Media markts disposal.""THINK TO BE ON A GLOBAL LEVEL MEDIA MARKT AND MAKE RULES COMMON TO ALL WITH SCRUTINIZED SOP'S"" rather being partially biased.Thanks and Hope this puts something in your head.Aditya GawadeCitizen: India",0,1
MediaMarkt,MediaMarkt officially SUCKS,"Non-existent customer service. Never respect delivery information shared on their website. Customer service does NOT respond, not even after escalation. Complete lack of honesty, communication and respect for their clientel. This is the third time in a row that I've had the same experience, and they never fail to disappoint! My advice, order elsewhere, even if it's more expensive as Media Markt should stop their e-business all together if this is the level of service they provide. I will never spend one more € with them, and I'm generally a very tolerant person.",0,1
MediaMarkt,really bad experience,I bought a tv and the screen had black spots. They say that this was not covered by guarantee!! and finally they replace it with another that was missing some screws!!!,0,1
MediaMarkt,Unreal how bad this company is,"Unreal how bad this company is. They delivered our washer dryer and left it at the front door. In their policies it says they take it up 3 flights of stairs - this is a total lie. They took it up one and then said it was dangerous to take it up the second. The guy was just lazy & probably underpaid by this total waste of space company. Their twitter account told me 'we have to believe the driver, sorry there's nothing we can do'. My wife has MS and literally couldn't lift it up the stairs. If you use this company prepare to be disappointed. What a joke.",0,1
MediaMarkt,Empty box!!,"I bought an empty box today at Barcelona... It was supposed to have a PSVR inside but when I got home it had nothing but the users guide and such, and the store won't evens open tomorrow... That's so sad, I'm frustrated!!",1,1
MediaMarkt,Another report of terrible customer service,"Another report of terrible customer ""service""!I bought a Taurus kettle for €29.99 on 20 June 2017 at the branch in Zenia Boulevard. It blew up (literally) on the first weekend in October. I took it back (having remembered to keep the box, from previous experience). The girl said they would pack it up, and send it back to the manufacturers for repair or replacement! ALL kettles etc are now made in China. I said, no, we would have nothing to boil water in, so eventually she agreed to a replacement. This time I chose a Ufesa, for €29, (i did not get the €0.99 back!). Well, this one lasted 2 DAYS. The filter thing did not fit, it just balanced in the spout, so immediately fell off and so the kettle would not switch off. Again I took it back, queued for 30 minutes (only 1 person on the desk). This time I wanted my money back, but, oh no, I had apparently purchased this kettle with a gift card (which I have never had) and they could not understand the simple fact that I had bought the original kettle with a credit card. It seems that Mediamarkt do NOT ever return money, even on a card, and they had pretended that the second kettle had been bought on a gift card. So, no returns, I could only replace it. Well, I gave up and chose another one, either a Bosch or a Philips But, guess what, the demo kettles were on show but there was no stock of either make. I asked an assistant for the Bosch, which was apparently in stock upstairs (who was in charge of stock control?) and he said wait 10 minutes and I'll get one. I actually had to wait 35 minutes for one to appear (apparently in the far corner of the roof!). So in all, changing a kettle took me 3 hours + several arguments.While I was waiting, I spoke to an Irish lady who was looking at kettles, and told her my experience. So she said she would not buy and would go to another shop! So that made me feel a bit better, and I will never ever set foot in that store again. I should say that my previous kettle, an ONN (where made I don't know) was bought as a pack with a toaster of same make from ASDA for 17.99 pounds in 2006 and lasted 11.5 years each. What a difference!",0,1
MediaMarkt,Just go somewhere else.,"Honestly, choosing to buy my phone here was probably the worst choice I have ever made. I placed the order on September 29th, and the phone was out of stock. So I asked the customer service when I might get it and they told me that I will get it in a couple of days. After a couple of days, I called again and they told me that I will have to wait another week. This morning, I got another email from them saying that I will not get my phone for another two weeks. And were they trying to do everything in their hands to deliver the product as soon as possible? Nope. I just cannot believe that this is the kind of treatment I deserve after buying a product that is worth hundreds of euros. Do yourself a favor and make your purchase somewhere else.",0,1
MediaMarkt,No wonder you didn't make it in Denmark,"My girlfriend has had her laptop in your hands for service for 2½ months and still hasn't gotten it back yet.Everything in this regard, except for the one thing you outsource - the actual service - you just don't know how to do.You can't provide useful information, you don't know how to communicate internally and you certainly don't know when enough is enough.She should have gotten multiple alternatives and offers of compensation, but the only thing she keeps getting, is customer service employees and managers saying, what should be your slogan ""I Don't Know"".In Denmark we have a word - ""Storhedsvanvid"", look that up and make that realisation, before your next plans of trying out the Danish market ever comes on the whiteboard again.

MediaMarkt,Worst customer service I have ever experienced,I bought a zte A610 from media markt in Valencia on Calle Colon.It was marketed as a dual sim with SSD expansion on the website. This is not true you either fit 2 sims or 1 sim and the micro SSD in the phone.I then tried to put two sims in the device and only 1 worked. I swapped the sims around and the opposite sim worked so it was obviously a fault in the phone. Port 2 on the sim tray would not read any sims.I took it to the store i got it from. One of the workers started poking in the sim tray and in to the phone with a paper clip. I work in IT and have never seen anyone try to fix a phone with a paper clip until today....after fidgeting with it for the best part of 30 minutes they gave me the phone back. They said they can´t do anything for me. I got to the gift wrapping table and started to check everything was there. Quickly realising they had not returned my English ee Sim card that had £50 credit on it and was a scratch on the screen (this will cost me) that was not there when I handed it over. I went back to the desk and they said the sim wasn't there. They had lost it. When you live in Spain it is very difficult to get a replacement ee sim card.I then left as had seen enough. After picking my daughter up from nursery I later returned. Remember the scratch that they caused.. well I went straight to the returns desk and pony tail boy on the desk said I can't return the phone as it had a scratch on the screen and he didn't believe I gave his colleagues the sim. He said all this in Spanish. I told them to check the CCTV but he ignored me. He said I need to send my phone to be repaired and it will take 14 days !?!? Do they send it to China or sell so many faulty products that they are over worked?!?!?! I went to the phone section of the shop and asked the guy on the desk if the insurance covered the repairs to the faulty product and he said it did ( he spoke better English so was easier to under stand) roul I think his name is. He was very helpful and said I could send it to be repaired of he could exchange it as it has only been 2 days. He gave me the replacement phone and I had to go to the payment desk to have the security tag taken off. When I got there pony tail boy who had refused to help then came over and said he is not taking the tags off and I am not getting a replacement. He then started to shout down the phone at someone I'm guessing he called the only helpful guy to give him a telling off?? The returns desk all have a extremely bad attitude. Does Media Markt charge/punish the employees every time they accept a return?? After all this the pony tail boy then sent my phone off to be fixed. I am betting it will come back in a worse state... Roul was the only nice person I met in the store that day I am starting to wonder why? Is it the company that turns their employees sour or do Media Markt only employ sour people?,0,1
MediaMarkt,Horrible Repairing service!!!,"Horrible Repairing service!!!I went today to Media Markt “Johannisthaler Chausee, Berlin"" to replace my Iphone 6 Battery, the device itself was working very well, just a weak battery that used to work for 3 continious hours with no problems ( the device is only 2 years old!)The Technichan there took the phone, totally checked and tested it and told me that the problem is with the battery, I can replace it with a new one for 59 euro. You can come an hour later to take the phone.When I came to him he told me, ""srry, the phone is not working anymore! There was Water inside, when I opened the phone it just went inside and burned the Motherboard!I came with a Weak battery and now I lost the whole Phone! It's not my fault, you are professionals, that's why I came to you!! If he told me there's a risk that there maybe water inside, I wouldn't let him open it, the old battery was doing just fine! ( supposing that there was a Water inside as he say which I highly doubt! ) I have all the papers signed by your Technichan that say that the problem was only with the battery and everything was working just fine before!I went to the Police today and they agreed that I have every right and recommended that I should contact a Lawyer, I hope that you can find a quick solution to my problem, otherwise I'm gonna sue you!________________________________________________Schrecklicher Reparatur-Service!!!Heute bin ich zu Media Markt “Johannisthaler Chausee, Berlin"" gegangen um meinen Iphone 6 Akku zu tauschen.

MediaMarkt,Mediamarkt what a crappy company!,"Mediamarkt what a crappy company!! I ordered a fridge that the company said would be here the next day. It never came.... this company didn't even feel the need to inform me that the fridge was out of stock. Whats worse is that they didn't even know when they were going to get it back in stock!!! I called the company which did not make any sense because the Mediamarkt ""klantenservice"" cannot answer any of your question. We all know if you order a fridge and you want it in your home the next day its because your current fridge is broken. People don't just randomly go out buying refrigerators because its pretty if you have a functioning one at home.I called and asked whats going on with my order? Its no longer in stock! Okay why didn't I receive an email( I'm still waiting on that initial email). I spend almost an hour on the phone with the klantenservice medewerker who was totally useless. She gave me two options cancel my order for which i would then have to wait 1 to 3 days for my money back ( Crazy people because I need a refrigerator today) or they will send a request to the distributor to find out when I can get it. Why is the request only happening after I called Mediamarkt? None of these options are helpful to me who is still in need of a fridge!!!! So I explain this to the klantenservice worker. She proceeds to put me on hold and says she will try to ask for a solution. OMG Useless!!!!!! She came back with the same two options she gave me before. How the hell is this acceptable its almost like she put me on hold to answer other peoples questions and when she was ready to deal with me again gave me the same conclusion. I had to ask her if its not possible to at the very least offer a refrigerator that is similar in worth and in functionality. She then proposed my option which was accepted. I was offered another refrigerator which I accepted. Only to receive an email shortly after I called that its no longer going through and I will be getting my original fridge and a 25 euro giftcard for guess where Mediamarkt!!!!! If these people aren't crazy I don't know what is, why would u assume that I want a gift card to spend in of all places Mediamarkt!!!!!!!!WHAT I NEED AS A CLIENT IS FOR YOU TO SEND ME SOME MONEY BACK SO I CAN PAY MY PHONE BILL BECAUSE I BEEN CALLING YOUR USELESS CLIENT SERVICE AND HAVE PROBABLY SPENT MORE THAN AN HOUR ON THE PHONE. I ALSO NEED TO BE COMPENSATED FOR ALL OF THE FOOD I HAD TO THROW OUT AND FOR HAVING TO DINE OUT. I DONT NEED A 25 EURO GIFT CARD!!!!!!To Mediamarkt you have been the market leader in the netherlands and that has afforded you some privileges but remember if they client is not happy you have no business. The demand to shop at Mediamarkt for high quality products and good service has surely died.I hope this reaches Mediamarkt because this is definitely something we all can learn from. Clearly the client isn't a priority I suggest everyone to order from bol.com or even wehkamp.nl because the service is better!!! BOYCOTT Mediamarkt to show them clients actually matter!!!!!!!!!!",0,1

Media Markt have to record all calls. They would not transfer the call to customer relations or customer complaints. Media Markt refused to document a complaint. That behaviour by Media Markt does not represent true customer support 'klantservice'. Media Markt does not care about its failures because they are making big money.

That was not correct, because they received the payment. Only on Saturday, after my persistence they confirmed to me they have IT issues and can't process the order in their system.

MediaMarkt,Stay away if you don't like Russian roulette,"Problems can happen. What matters is the attitude of the retailer towards his customer.Mediamarkt, because of a problem that occurred in their system, lost an order in their system, despite the fact that i am charged. By lost in the system, i mean not even packaged or shipped at first place. So i cancelled my order. It has been a week and they could still NOT EVEN cancel the order (because of the specific technical problem that occurred in ""their"" system), yet alone the additional time it will take afterwards for the refund.They even cannot offer to accelerate the process of ""just"" cancelling an order which was never shipped. 7 days and still waiting just for a simple cancellation.Imagine, you buy an item Online, from supposedly the biggest retailer of Europe. You pay with IDEAL, so the money goes within seconds to MediaMarkt's account. Your receive an email with order code and your address, then shortly after another email with confirmation of payment. After 2 days you call them to ask why your item is not even shipped. They discover something went wrong at their system so they don't even see my order ( i give them my order number but it's gone into thin air). Me: OK, what can we do? They have to trace back the order. We wait a day, then i call again to offer options: 1. give me my money back, and i immediately reorder it. MM: no, still we first have to trace back the order, and besides it would take 5-7 days for you to get refunded. 2.OK, then i see there is another item just like the one i ordered, send that instead, and later try to sort out why you never shipped my first item. MM: no, still we first have to trace back the order. 3. Give me a voucher worth what i paid and i go to your store and buy it there (even accepting to pay some extra on top as this was a outlet item) MM: No, not possible. Me: Ok, what is the only action that you can process immediately? MM: Cancel it. Me: OK, fine cancel it then. (BTW at that time, i also notice there has been 15 euros discount on the same item i bought 2 days ago, ok a different story). Then another day, still the order is not even cancelled. I call, they tell me because something went wrong in the system, only one department can cancel the order. We forward it to them. OK, yet another day. Now i am angry. i call back. Same explanation. Only one department can solve it. Me: Ok please give me the phone number or email of that department? MM: No, we cannot do it. What we can do is, i will forward the request once again, and this time you will be in cc. OK, one more day passes by, now it has been a week. I call again, again 5 minutes of the same story as each time the person on the otherside of the line is different. Me: Ok, i understand you cannot give me the phone number or email of that magical department that will cancel my order. what is this department? finance? MM: we canot tell. Me: OK i had enough, tell me who i can escalate this non-sense problem, i want to complaint, who is your customer relations person, department, etc? MM: You can make a complaint in the form on our internet website. In the mean while you just have to be patient and wait for that department to cancel your order.

Unfortunately there was no way of trying the headphones on in the shop (even though they were not the type that go in the ear but are placed over the ear). I bought them and tried them on at the counter. As I suspected might be the case, they were no good. They could just not stand up to the moderate g-forces of a firm head shake and they dug in to the side of my head. I wanted a refund and asked at the service counter (about 5 mins after I had paid). They told me that because of hygiene issues they ""could not refund anything that had touched a body"". This I knew must be a lie. I inquired further about it and basically we came to the conclusion that no items could be refunded ever because they had touched human skin and there therefore a health hazard.

The unfortunately did not allow using an international Visa credit card on the site itself, but this was quickly remedied by the additional payment options they've provided, such as PayPal :)The confirmation emails I've received were well written and informative.A few hours after ordering I've gotten an email stating that my order has been sent and will arrive at my location between 10:00-14:30 the next morning.(I was doubtful - where I'm coming from, these time frames are usually not accurate at all)The next morning, around 11:30 I've had a knock on my door and in front of me was the nice PostNL guy, holding a huge MediaMarkt package for me :DI am super happy, satisfied and impressed by the service I've received.(Before ordering online, I actually went to one of the MediaMarkt shops...they didn't have the laptop I waned, but the staff was really helpful, informative and willing to help. They even gave me a call a few days later to say that they've got the model I wanted in stock again and wished me congratulations for getting it online :P)One small thing I'd like to mention is that the product information on their website was not entirely accurate. I've mentioned this and they have fixed it, but it gave me a bit of doubt at first. I gave them a phone call and the information was clarified and fixed. Stellar service!The laptop arrived in perfect condition, as described and well packed with protective materials.Ratings: Ease of payment - 9.5/10 (0.5 off for not accepting international visa cards on the site)Ease of ordering - 10/10Quality of Staff - 10/10Shipping speed and cost - 10/10Packaging quality - 10/10The well being of the product - 10/10Accuracy of website product information - 9.5/10The right product was received - 10/10Trustworthiness - 10/10 Customer Satisfaction - 100/10 ;)MediaMarkt, thank you!

MediaMarkt,"Webshop order can't be delevered on time, do not want to return money, lie on the phone","1) Ordered the product in the webshop May 15th. Usually the delivery is done next day. Still has nothing delivered. 2) Called by the phone and asked to cancel order - they refused, complaining about the issue in the system.3) Asked why they still accept orders which they can't process. They said that the problem was with some specific orders during the same day, other orders are processed ok.2 and 3 are lies. I have colleague who ordered things couple weeks before myself and had the same problem. Also some comments on this site confirms that it is not only my order issue. My colleague asked for order cancelation and money were returned to him. So I do not see any reason why it can't be done with my order.As far as I see it allowing people to put orders to the system while they know they can't process them is cheating. I'm very unhappy with this experience with Mediamarkt.",0,1
MediaMarkt,Pathetic service!!,"I had placed an order on 1st may.Today is 8th may - Havent received the order till now.So much for their false promises of prompt delivery!!It is causing harassment and so much inconvenience to me. I am very disapoointed with the service.I have been harassed and caused much inconvenience by you. Instead please provide me Irobot Braava 320 at the price at which I had placed the order on the webshop I.e. €159. I had to wait for 2 weeks because of your system problem, and now the price available for this on your webshop for this is €219.I think providing this at the original purchase price is the least you can do!Look forward to hearing back from you.",0,1

MediaMarkt,Good service and satisfactory product functionality,"I'm pretty glad with the whole process of online shopping with Media Markt.However, there's something that I'd like to mention about the product that I purchased.Samsung Galaxy S4 battery shown in the picture at the time of purchase is ""Made in Korea"" but the battery received is ""Fabricated in Vietnam, Cell made in Malaysia""So, the product received is actually different that the displayed one but it works perfectly fine.",0,4
MediaMarkt,Perfect service!,I was pretty amazed by the high quality service that Mediamarkt provides to its cutomers. Especially for the online sales. It's hard to find on the market such a good service ( from order placement to goods delivery) provided by a web shop but Mediamarkt has it all! I don't think I would buy something on a webshop other than Mediamarkt. Highly recommended if you want to be a happy customer!,0,5

MediaMarkt,Bitterly disappointed !!,"We live in France, and went to Holland for a long weekend to celebrate a special achievement by our grandson. As a present from us he could select a long wished for laptop. He ordered the laptop Friday 29/11 at 20.00 hrs. We were all looking forward to receive it the next day as stated on the website. The only thing we have received so far ( Sunday1/12),is an order confirmation, and that we will be notified when the order is processed. We have to travel back home now, and we are bitterly disappointed not to have enjoyed our grandsons receipt of our gift.If Mediamarkt cannot comply with their promise of next day delivery, they should at least have the decency to inform us !",0,2
MediaMarkt,The webshop and costumer service work very well.,"I am rating the webshop service with 3 stars for this reasons:The website says ""if you order before 10pm today, you'll receive it today"". This is a lie and by the way is illegal to state something that the store is not able to provide. I had trouble with my order because of that. What I bought, I needed for the other day before 4pm. I thought as I was ordering before 10pm, it would arrive at my house in the same day. Turns out it did not and the next morning I received an e-mail telling me it was sent and I could track it. But the status of my order at post nl said it could arrive anytime before 21:30. As this was not very precise, and I needed it before 4pm, I had to go to the store and buy one myself. This was when I was disappointed. I thought people could help me cancel the webshop order or anything like it, but actually there was not a single employee who seemed interested in helping me. They were very unpolite, by the way. So what I did was cancelling it at the website when I arrived home, and then received a return number. When the item was delivered to me, I put the return number on it and took to the store. There, again, the employees seemed lost and did not know what to do. Now all I am expecting is that they managed to do the right procedure and my money will be back on my account.However, I must say the customer online service is good. And also by phone people were helpful.",0,3
MediaMarkt,"On time, at logic time.","Mediamarkt statement is ""if you purchase before 22:00 hs, you get it home next day for free"". I purchased a TV at 21:45 hs, as it was for my daughter and we meet that late to select the TV together. Next day at 18¨00 they rang the bell. It took 1 minute. Perfect.",0,5
MediaMarkt,FALSE ADVERTISING - EMPTY PROMISES,"Their webshop promised speedy delivery: ordered before 22:00 tonight, in house tomorrow.YEAH, RIGHT.Ordered Friday afternoon ...Now they're telling me it'll be Monday at the earliest.That's three days later, not the next day.They'll say anything to get your business! Don't trust them!",0,1
MediaMarkt,Excellent discounter but needs to select and train personnel beter,"+ like very much that personnel will look into competitor's pricing and give a counter offer upon request+ good and large choice of product range+ close to parking possibilities, ESP. Important when buying large items- personnel is not adequate, badly informed and often unprofessional- personnel is too young and not well trained- personnel is sometimes rude and negligent-",0,4
