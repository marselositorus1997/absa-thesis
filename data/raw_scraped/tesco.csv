Buy 6 bottles of wine and if one of those includes an in-house reduction then you lose a massive 25% off the whole cost of those 6 bottles of wine. In my case that was over £9 lost. When I realised back at the car they got the wine back and all the shopping. How many people don't check the receipt. WHAT A SCAM,0,1

Tesco,Deliveries made 100% of the time. Keeping my parents safe.,"Each delivery saver pass lasts 6 months. The first one was mainly for elderly parents in lockdown. Of the 42 deliveries there were no cancellations (which is quite remarkable considering pandemic and weather conditions in cold winter). I guesstimate only 3 or 4 refunds were made for inferior product (kefir that was bad on delivery, bad looking beans), totalling about £10 in value. No quibbles so far with any refunds requested. We’ve never asked for bags. Always had our own boxes and bags by the door to load off the baskets.I’m pleased to say that we have collected enough Tesco points for a free delivery pass. And parents have found Tesco very reliable come rain or shine. They’ve not had issues with bagless delivery and have not caught Covid off anyone (incl Tesco drivers). I want to thank Tesco for being ever so dependable. They always deliver and we will continue to use the delivery pass in the future.",0,5
Tesco,Experience of the latest mechanisms for home deliveryYesterday I received the first home…,"Yesterday I received the first home delivery from Tesco with the goods I had ordered in the green trays without bags.Some observations:First of all, this means the drivers have to take much longer to deliver the goods – which means they are longer in your presence thus providing more opportunity for viral transfer – in both directions.Secondly all the goods are rehandled as they are delivered. In these pandemic times, no longer do customers have the security of knowing that probably around 12 hours have passed since these goods were previously handled (thus reducing any possible viral contamination). At least with deliveries in the plastic trays, most goods were not re-handled on delivery. Whether the drivers wear or do not wear gloves is irrelevant; no one can be sure gloves and hands are being adequately sanitized between deliveries, nor that drivers taking goods to other homes and spending longer therein, have not picked up viral particles.Thirdly reading between the lines on the website, Tesco is keen to encourage everyone to either go to the stores or, at worst, to use Click and Collect. One reason for using home delivery, of course, is weight. I had over 70 items delivered to my home yesterday including liquid – milk, fruit juice - which is notoriously heavy, hence the need for home delivery.Tesco is acting as if the pandemic is over. It is not; look at India.Nor is it taking on board the challenge with weight for many customers.I have found Tesco deliveries enormously beneficial over the last year, and the drivers in the main helpful and co-operative, but it would appear that customers do not rank highly enough for Tesco to take their possible concerns on board.I believe Tesco needs to start thinking about the needs of their customers if they wish to retain them into the future. Tesco may also like to think about encouraging suppliers to use packaging which can be recycled, rather than forcing customers to bear the brunt of difficult practices in order to tick some box somewhere.",0,1
Tesco,Ordered £150 worth of food,"Ordered £150 worth of food, all delivered without bags it took me 30 mins of my time taking things out individually while the driver just stood there patiently waiting. This whole bagless situation is joke, why not follow what Ocado does, charges 40p for all bags and then next time the delivery comes, they buy the bags off you again for 5p each and they are recycled. Why should I have to hold filthy dirty plastic trays that the driver has just handled and other countless other customers. Also stop delivering bread that has 4 hours expiry date left, not even a huge family can eat a whole loaf before it expires.",0,1

Tesco,Delivered without bags and told bags…,Delivered without bags and told bags are no longer available. 100+ items having to carry them a few at a time!

Tesco,Doesn’t even deserve a single star,"Doesn’t even deserve a single star, not only are the staff rude they were foul mouthed as well.

Tesco,excellent response,i have been having Tesco deliveries since the first lockdown and we were shielding. Generally the service has been good as well as products with just occasional issues. Tesco's range and pricing beats all of the other supermarkets. However this week i had several issues with my order largely because it must have been picked by someone with little experience [lawnseed instead of plant food for one]. anyway I made a complaint high up and wow did they respond. my wine which was out of stock was obtained from another store and the other issues remedies the same day along with a lovely bouquet. I cannot speak too highly of the way this was handled. I shall go on using them in the future. Thank you Tesco!!,0,5

Tesco,I would like to mention the Staff at…,"I would like to mention the Staff at the TESCO, Churchdown store in Gloucestershire. Whether I have asked for help from the Store Manager, to the youngest or newest shop floor member of staff the Staff have always been professional and very helpful to me as a Disabled (wheelchair) customer.I would especially like to mention the Community approach when supporting the Poppy Appeal.I have organised the collection at this Store from End of Oct to 11th Nov nearly every year since it opened 2013.The generosity of the Customers and the high-level of support offered to me and Poppy collection volunteers has always been excellent. Every Store Manager over these years has gone out of their way to stop the tills at 11.00hrs on the 11th of Nov, with staff standing in silence.Furthermore, last year the Store Management Including Lee Trunks, Hannah Impey and other supervisors promoted the Poppy Appeal even though the Lockdown ment our volunteers could not be there.Over these years of Poppy Collecting we volunteers get to observe the everyday working of the staff and could list many customers who have said how this store is so friendly and has a community feel to it.I'm sure I have had a 'non than perfect item of fruit or vegetable' in the thousands of pounds worth of food I have bought since 2013 and I even thought there would be issues about added traffic ( I was wrong, no traffic problem) etc when the store was built. Additionally, this store has been a firm support to our local community, especially during times like the Pandemic with staff putting their lives at risk to provide nearly everything we have needed ( except when customers bought a lot more loo rolls than they might have needed).PS to be clear my only ties to TESCO is that of being a Customer and a volunteer to local community groups.Well done the Staff at the Churchdown TESCOs, Gloucester.",0,5

Tesco,HUMILIATED AND BEING MADE TO FEEL LIKE A THIEF,"I used a self-serve till at Tesco and the machine didn't offer me a receipt. Since half my purchases were for an elderly neighbour, I asked for help in getting a receipt. The manager came over and used his card to go back in the system and when my purchases were displayed, he then claimed that I hadn't paid!!!I explained that I saw the message ""approved, remove card"", confirming that I had paid but he wouldn't believe me.On arrival home, I checked my bank statement online and I had indeed been charged TWICE. I phoned Tesco but the guy told me I would have to phone back the following day and obtain an ""Authorisation number IF I could PROVE that I'd been charged twice and must then appeal to my bank.""I did this this, and after several epically long phone calls and speaking to several people at my bank (this took the WHOLE morning!), I was informed that this is NOT the way to obtain a refund; I must simply wait for the charge to ""Drop out"" of my account!!I then used 'Resolver' to approach Tesco but their whole attitude was that of denial - they simply would NOT believe me. When I threatened legal action, they pretended that my Resolver letter had gone to a ""non-monitored"" email address. I felt totally humiliated -aagain- and being given the run-around and virtually accused of being a liar. I also find it INCREDIBLE that they don't KNOW if someone has paid their bill- HOW can they run a business like that?If someone were to shoplift by not paying with their card, they have no way of knowing what the truth is- I saw the screen after the manager called it up and there was indeed NOTHING TO SHOW that I had indeed paid. 4 days later, their charge is still in my bank account and the ripoff and humiliation HURTS: Tesco now say I ""Must PROVE"" that I have been made to pay twice, yet I had already scanned my receipt and my bank statement and sent it to them. Are they suggesting that I have FORGED my bank statement- I hate being made to feel a LIAR AND A THIEF.",0,1
Tesco,Blatant profiteering. We CAN do maths you know!,"Before lockdown #1 Tesco used to do a deal whereby you could buy 4 bottled craft beers for £6.Next thing you know they introduce a “Only 3 items per person” rule and their beer offer gets gets repriced to 3 bottles for £5. This whilst making a media statement that they will under no circumstances profiteer due to restrictions.Now I can do maths and can plainly see that’s not true. So I boycotted Tesco for all my shopping thereafter, a happy move since I now actually prefer Aldi for most things, and they don’t move all the products around randomly, which drives me nuts.Now, I’m back in Tesco today for someone else….I notice its still 3 bottles for £5 despite there being no longer any restrictions on items.Funny that, eh? Now I’m not naïve, I know Tesco’s are in it to make money. But don’t insult our collective intelligence by saying you aren’t profiteering, when you clearly are.",0,1

Tesco,Poor customer service,Cannot fault the drivers as always punctual and really friendly but the customer support team are very poor. Got an email last week to advise they were going to release Easter delivery slots on the 2nd March to delivery saver customers. Seeing as they release slots every day at midnight I stayed up until then to secure a slot after missing out at Christmas (after waiting in a queue for 2hrs). Midnight came and went....no slots appeared so gave up and went to bed. Had to get up early for work the next day so not happy I stayed up for nothing. Only to find the slots appeared at 7am. So I emailed customer support and asked why it didnt say it in their email. Their reply 'sorry but we were unable to advise when they would become available'. Er? So I replied back asking why they would bother to communicate a release date if they didnt know when the slots would appear. The next reply from them said 'they realise some people cannot stay up until midnight so they released them at 7am.' So they did know when they were releasing them??? So why wasnt it in the email? That way I wouldnt have stayed up for nothing? Now they are no longer responding. Rubbish customer service which appears to be the norm now for Tesco.,0,2

I took the matter up with Customer Services who, because the packaging had gone and I now (because of COVID) decline the offer of a receipt, refused to do anything unless I could supply pics of things I do not have or return to the store which is impossible at the moment. I offered my club card details so they could trace but this wasn’t good enough. In essence, a very poor product made with very poor ingredients made even worse by very poor customer service.

Tesco,Online order cancelled. Despicable in this pandemic.,My wife and I are self isolating due to the pandemic. We were lucky to source a late delivery slot as all the other delivery slots were taken (All other companies were fully booked as well). No issues with the website in placing our order as I've done it before. I was even willing to accept several substitutes that given the current pandemic; I fully understood not everything may be available.However our order was cancelled on the day of delivery: ''Due to store issues your order has been unfortunately cancelled''. As you can imagine my wife and I were severely angry over this as we were given no true explanation as to WHY it was cancelled. If it was due to Covid; fair enough. If there was a fire or a burglary at the store; fair enough. But we were not told anything else.Luckily my mother-in-law works for a supermarket competitor and I asked her very nicely to do my shopping on my behalf to which she was an absolute lifesaver.I will never ever use the Tesco delivery service again. Shame on you for letting my wife and I down during these difficult times.,0,1
Tesco,Blatant Discrimination,"Blatant Discrimination Clubcard pricing ONLY for customers with a clubcard ... I beg your pardon ? so because I choose not to be part of these ridiculous marketing schemes I have to pay double the price. So if I am travelling and stop at a garage for fuel the cashier dosent say ‘ excuse me love that’ll be 40 quid please for 20 quids worth of fuel ‘ because you don’t come here often do they ? No of course not , can you imagine!! So what intellectual genius had a light bulb moment and dreamt up this scheme..of how not to encourage new customers to return. Tesco are always banging on about matching major competitors such as Aldi & Lidl etc but they have got it completely wrong , some of the price reductions for the special clubcard customers are on branded products not even sold in Aldi .( I know as I am a regular Aldi shopper) and the discriminative pricing strategy where two prices are displayed on products is quite misleading and confusing this just infuriated me and completely put me off shopping in Tesco. In actual fact the complete opposite! I won’t be returning ! Price it properly and competitively in the first place and keep it consistent that’s what shoppers want and quite frankly I’m sure that’s what makes Aldi & Lidl etc so successful they don’t mess about with silly schemes, dont sell 200 different bags of crisps you go in get your shop , pay a fair price the price you see and leave .. simple , happy days .",0,1

"" I dont know something from the doctors"" At this point my son showed her his medcine. She said that this was not sufficient proof!!! I left disgruntled, I immediatly called my doctor, as I was not too sure if id missed something on the news. They said we do not issue proof for people who are exempt from wearing a mask.!!! I drove back to my home loaded a bag with my sons many medications that he has to take on a daily basis. I also checked the latest on the GOV website which clearly stated you do not need to show proof.I then went back into the store asked to speak to the store manager. She was actually polite and said the staff member was in the wrong for telling me that information. But this has left me very angry as I have worked in retail myself for the last 27 years!

It's my right to choose to not wear a mask"". I asked to speak to the manageress, who is usually outside smoking, and she said there was nothing she could do and that it was ENDEMIC in that store. I said it was not safe on the customers and staff and she said she knows. How ludicrous is that? The very next day I had a guy standing right behind me in the queue not wearing a mask. I asked him to keep back and he said ""why?"" I said 'You're not wearing a mask, why not?"" He said, ""I'm aware of the rules in your country. I'm exempt"". I said to him that if he could provide proof of this then I would apologise in front of all the customers and staff.

Tesco,Online grocery shopping,I have been using tesco since March as a priority customer due to the covid 19 pandemic. I honestly don't know what I would have done without them as I have had to solely rely on them for my groceries. I do however have complaints. A lot of my products have not had the shelf life that their website advises therefore a lot of the food has not lasted me the week. I have complained to their customer services who always refund me and have even had replacements sent out again the next day. They have been very knowledgeable polite and efficient.I do think though that the delivery charge is a lot of money when added up over the month. I have tried to change my delivery to the saver plan but they aren't accepting any new customer at the moment. I am paying £4.50 a week for my deliveries at the moment and cannot even select the hour slot which is also the same price which I think is unfair and a bit of a con. However I have always managed to get a slot. Other than that the service has been good. But just be aware of the use by dates not being accurate on many occasions.,0,4
Tesco,Excellent Service,"We use Tesco home delivery which is typically very good and we would heartily recommend.

Tesco,I understand that with the pandemic…,"I understand that with the pandemic being on everyone's mind of late, but come on is there any need for rudeness, treating the customers like dirt. Is it more important as a manager that you take your phone text message than help a customer. What a bad example to set your floor staff that it is ok for the manager to use her personal phone and at the same time ignore the customer asking for help. How rude.... Things have been busy and stressful for everyone, but is there any need to dismiss a customer who is obviously less important than your text message. If this is the training Tesco give their staff then i will shop elsewhere.",0,2

Tesco,Tesco in Crediton,"Tesco in Crediton, Devon. I have been using this store for several years due to the lack of real competition rather than the quality of goods and staff. I have been shocked during the pandemic to notice that nearly all of the items for sale are now only available in the smallest, and least economic sizes, and that the range has shrunk considerably. I have discussed this with friends and family, and they have all said that the other supermarkets in nearby towns (Waitrose, Sainsburys, Co-op and Asda) still have a good range of products and pack sizes at competitive prices (which I have confirmed). This leads me to suspect that Tesco is chosing to limit its stock to inflate profits at at time when families are really struggling. Given the size of Tesco as a business, I cannot believe that it doesn't also have access to the larger and more economical packs that the other supermarkets are stocking. I appreciate that only stocking smaller and more expensive items by weight may be a policy of just this store, and that others may have chosen not to profiteer in this way.I also have issues with the staff in the Crediton branch. A few of them are very polite and friendly, but most are quite rude, the worst being 'Mike' on the tills who is particularly condescending, that is if he bothers to acknowledge me at all!",0,1

Tesco,Cause for Concern at Tesco,"I visit Tesco on the A4 Newbury, Berkshire on a regular bases and have found them very helpful and fulfilling as a retail outlet.However, on my last occasion I experienced a very disturbing event, that gave me a Cause for Concern.At the check out, the cashier was experiencing some difficulty with the products on the conveyer belt. He left his till and disappeared several times back into the store, not sure why.I put my groceries on the belt, then, he got up and ran out of the stores front door, then, came back in again.He started to process my groceries and something must have gone wrong, as he started to hit his own head with his fist saying: 'its a bad day, everything's going wrong'.I think everyone in the queue was stunned and did not know quite what to do, other than step back from someone who was out of his depth with this customer facing role, which appeared to have taken him to the edge!After a time, with no progress with my groceries, I said 'I will unload my groceries and take them to another cashier, which I did. When I got there, the person behind me was the person behind me in the queue at the previous till. We both looked at each other, embarrassed and not knowing what to say, having concern for both our safety, the cashier, other customers and Tesco staff.I really want to support Tesco, but, I feel there has to be a Duty of Care and Best Practice towards their customers in providing a safe, professional and good encounter with their staff.",0,1

Tesco,Grocery delivery a shambles & unsatisfactory customer service response,"Received email yesterday correctly confirming changes to online grocery order. However the delivery this morning had 20 items missing and 11 which had not been ordered. Customer service agent apologised, fair enough, but unable to have the missing items sent out today as apparently Tesco could not see the revised and confirmed order - very strange as Tesco had sent me the email with the correct order and my account also showed the same. Advised that I would have to re-order the 20 missing items - this would be senseless as next delivery slot is 34 days time. As the order was a complete shambles I suggested that in the circumstances I should be refunded for what was left of the order for which I would receive a response later in the day. Meanwhile I had to make a trip out to the supermarket (Tesco in fact) to buy the missing £40 worth of items, which defeats the purpose of home delivery. As customer services had not replied by end of day a further two phone conversations resulted in the offer of a £10 Tesco goodwill voucher, which no way matches the inconvenience, wasted time, disappointment and frustration, and a refund of the delivery charge which I have yet to see. Yes, there was a computer glitch which apparently affected a number of customer orders, but Tesco did not have the ability to put things right with their loyal customer quickly and satisfactorily.",0,1
Tesco,Tray liners a complete waste of time!!,"Tray liners a complete waste of time!!Since April I have been either using the click and collect or delivery service to try and limit the transmission of Covid. Up until recently it’s worked well until they changed to tray liners!! Who’s bright idea was this?? For the last few weeks I’ve struggled but this week I’ve hurt my back and felt compelled to say something. The staff at the click and collect all agree it’s not the best option and they’ve had lots of complaints. I rang Customer Services who politely apologised and sent me a £4 voucher, after I’d told her if they continue to use liners I won’t be shopping with them and asked for a Manager to call me. A Manager rang me and again just lip service! He told me all info will be collated and sent back to the relevant Department but will not be changing the bagging option within the near future. I told him I’m paying 40p for bags which I can’t use anymore, so much for saving the planet! I asked has the H&S side of this been considered. He claimed yes! I disagreed and asked what the max weight limit is. I asked if I’d dropped the liner and the jars smashed who would replace the items he confirmed that would be down to me. I’ve asked to escalate this higher as I really feel it’s not right. I’m a healthy, able bodied 50 yr old woman and capable of lifting bags WITH HANDLES but the liners are not fit for purpose and worry how others are going to manage. Apart from being a complete waste of time your shopping just rolls round the back of the boot! I’ve had an email to say someone will contact me within the next 7 days. I doubt anything will come of it but I’m not giving up on this one.",0,1

Tesco,Ridiculous Plastic Sheets Delivery,"I just had the most ridiculous delivery I've ever experienced, spread out on plastic sheets in the communal hallway, blocking the way in or out for the upstairs tenant & blocking me from shutting my front door, left open by the driver, who couldn’t be bothered to move some shopping to shut the door - he'd seen me open it when he came there, knowing full well I wouldn't be able to get to it (I am not as able-bodied as the driver, nor as young, to hop/dodge groceries). My delivery sheet specifically asks that the door to the upstairs flat & the path to the front door not be blocked when placing bags inside.I asked the driver if the shopping was in bags, he knew it wasn’t but said yes, so I retreated behind my flat door to ‘social-distance’. It wasn't in bags at all, just lying on plastic sheeting (called 'liners' by Tesco). I heard banging, thumping & crashing, it was the 10 bottles of pop I'd ordered falling about.I had not anticipated having to get a broom/garden rake to get my shopping into my flat & into a room where I could rake forkfuls towards me bit by bit to place in bags/in my trolley, before transporting to the bathroom, under-stair cupboard or kitchen. The frozen stuff partly defrosted which means all the contents are stuck together now. This took 3 hrs in all as I am disabled. Nor had I anticipated being asked if I had any bags myself by the call centre when I rang to complain. I replied that I hadn’t thought I’d need any as I’d ticked the box for bags AND the driver confirmed they were bagged!I was told that the reason for the liners was to use less plastic – there’s more plastic in just one of these useless ‘show-pieces’ than in four bags at least – not just because they’re voluminous but because they are a lot thicker than the flimsy bags used previously. How Tesco can think that dumping people’s shopping at floor-level is a great idea is beyond me, even when young/fit I wouldn’t have wanted a workout picking up my fortnight’s shopping from the floor. It was suggested that the driver could bring the stuff in, it’s even more difficult if it was dumped in my kitchen, there’s just no room there, plus there are litter trays. It isn’t the placement; it’s those ridiculous wasteful sheets of plastic. (I shall use these in/around my cat litter trays & to cover the contents of storage tubs).Tesco say the drivers will still pack bags at the door so I will try that (there’s still no room in my kitchen for unbagged crates full of shopping), any sheets will be used as above. I shall also sign up with Morrison’s/Sainsbury’s as per recommendations (I already use Ocado). Evidently not enough takers for ‘bagless deliveries’, though Tesco said ‘customers had “adapted” well; quite, we all hate standing freezing at the door watching the driver pack shopping we can’t bend to, but previously could scoop out with not too much difficulty. There are more older people than young, Tesco need to start thinking of them…",0,1

I find Tesco’s wonderful!!! Easy to order -really friendly delivery staff who DO keep their distance. I always have a few strong bags near the door to offload my goods into when they arrive. I wasn’t too keen on the delivery charge going up but have just found the ‘flex saver’ which is only £3 and has usually lots of slots.

Tesco,Lazy delivery drivers,"I usually don't leave reviews as I just don't like wasting my time and I am really not a picky customer. If something goes wrong I normally just get over it.BUT I had my delivery booked for today (27/10/2020) between 10 am and 2 pm, and I was texted that the driver will be here between 10 and 11 and he really was.I live on the second floor flat. After he arrived he unloaded my shopping and he was just standing downstairs. Then he called my TELEPHONE number saying ""Tesco delivery!!"", so I told him to call the intercom flat no 12 (really man? You don't know how it works?). So he called. I let him in. Then he kept on waiting on the ground floor. After a long while he called again (telephone again). ""I'm waiting downstairs, can anyone come to pick up the items??!"" I told him honestly and politely that the reason for me ordering HOME delivery is that I can't do the lifting, therefore I'm waiting for him on the 2nd floor. Then he just responded: ""So you can ask someone to help, if you don't, I'm just taking this back with me"". He also mentioned that they are not allowed to enter the building because of the Covid. But at the same time, when hiding himself behind Covid, he did not even wear a face mask. So what Covid are you talking about??Man, I'm a person after open heart operation and I can NOT do the lifting. And even if what he said was true (which I don't believe) and he couldn't enter the building, I should have been informed about that in advance. This time I was lucky, because my partner was in my place and he could help me with lifting, but I'm often alone when delivery comes, and if that was a case, I wouldn't have my shopping today.Man, if I was on the wheelchair, you would also ask me to come downstairs? Or if I was elder person? Or if I was pregnant? He completely didn't care, he was just about to take it all back. You know, people sometimes have serious reasons for not doing shopping in stores, but online instead.And there was no any good will from his side. I really wouldn't mind if he did it slowly. Just one tray by another. I don't mind, I can wait. I know it's heavy and not easy. But he clearly did NOT WANT to help.Tesco, good to know that disabled people cannot count on you.",0,1

I am not able to keep bending to transfer the shopping in to bags and struggle to lift the liners. We are self isolating because of serious health issues and cannot allow the driver in to our home (he has never offered to carry the shopping).

Tesco,The hidden cost of shopping at Tesco is too much,"Around ten years ago my family and I stopped shopping at Tesco after a piece of equipment bought in one of their stores caused around a £1000 worth of damage to my computer and by way of compensation Tesco sent me a voucher for £30. A couple of years ago, I decided to relent and start using their petrol stations and local shops. This weekend I was in the local store when some clever sole decided to drive into my car causing damage to my bumper, then drive away without attempting to leave their details. Upon entering the shop to request some support from the manager, once again, I was told there was nothing they could do even though my car was parked directly in front of a security camera (these cameras are obviously for Tesco's own security and not for the customers peace of mind). Once again Tescos total lack of interest in their customers shone through. I had a call from ""customer services"" today. All they were interested in was the name of the manager I'd spoken to. There was no mention of any kind of support for me, the paying customer, the guy who once again has a bill for several hundred pounds to repair the damage done by visiting their premises. The solution is quite simple. No more Tesco for me or anyone else in my family... and I will never miss the opportunity to tell people about how badly they treat their customers",0,1

We didnt hear one.In Malaysia a country of 33 million and less than 200 deaths the shopping experience is completely different. Trollies are cleaned as you pick them up, hand sanitiser is sprayed onto your hands and your temperature is taken before you go in. Non compliance will see you being refused entry or even arrested. If only Tesco could take a leaf out of their book and upgrade their Covid procedures. We have a resurgence in Covid cases so its imperative they tighten up the shopping experience as they did at the start of the pandemic.",0,1
Tesco,Still waiting for shopping!!!,I did an on line shop on Sunday night for delivery the following Thursday. Delivery should of been between 8pm n 9pm. At 9.30pm I got a text saying driver was late but it would be delivered before 10.30pm. Waited up till midnight. Still nothing. Not even a text. So I rang customer service on Friday morning to be told van had broken down in afternoon so all the loads had been cancelled. Why did nobody say that???? Tell the truth for god sake. I will never use you again Now waiting for a refund!!!! UPDATE Its now Friday the day after. Knock on the door at 8pm. Delivery driver stood there with one blue tray with about a fivers worth of shopping in it . I had previously ordered £57 worth. He said im sorry but thats all I've got of your order. I couldn't believe it!!!! His actual words were im so sorry this is p---poor!!! 😳😳😳 I will not be shopping at tesco again . Still not got my money back!!!,0,1
Tesco,We wont be shopping at Tesco again.,"Shame on you Tesco for delivering our Groceries, in Tray liners!We had 6 bags delivered on Sunday. The driver placed them on the hall floor, and they immediatly""spread"" out, with our groceries spilling on to the floor. The driver seemed embarrassed at this. I couldnt pick the tray liners up,too heavy, and no handles, so had to drag the items to the kitchen.Usually my Husband and myself manage between us, with my Husband being in a wheelchair, able to pick the bags up, and place them in a shopping trolley, i would then take them to the kitchen.We both have been isolating since February,as we are considered vunerable so having our food delivered was a godsend.But no more Tesco for us, we can not go through this again. Not only that Heavy items were in the same tray liner as delicate and bakery items!I would like to know off ""Dave"" the Chief Executive, if tray liners are given at the checkouts, in the Supermarket!!I did send an email to complain, and was told, well-we could have asked the driver to enter our house and bring the Groceries in! No thank you-- as he hadnt a mask on, so this would be out of the question.",0,1
Tesco,So pleased I  stopped ordering with Tesco! They have no loyalty  whatsoever,"I could never get a delivery slot during lockdown despite being a loyal customer for a long time. I decided not to renew the Delivery Saver because in effect I would have been paying for a delivery I could never book! I'd been very dissatisfied with the quality of their fruit for a while prior to this anyway. I now buy fruit and veg from a local market who offer free delivery with a much lower minimum spend; not £7 a month like Tesco. The quality is superb , full of flavour nothing like Tesco's hard tasteless fruit which never ripened but just rots!",0,1

Tesco,Tesco Home Delivery - without bags!,"We have been using Tesco home delivery for six months now, and have been pretty pleased. However, I recently received an email from Zoe Evans at Tesco which states 'We know that many of our customers are now ready to return to bagless orders'. Well, I would be very interested to hear who these ‘many’ customers are.The day after the Government have announced measures to try and tackle the exponential growth of Covid 19 in the UK our Tesco order was dumped in trays on our doorstep by a delivery driver who described the task of placing the shopping in plastic trays I had left out for him as ‘too much hassle’. Of course, I had no difficulty hearing him since he was not wearing a mask and was standing directly in front of me. He then stands and watches you whilst you unload the items one at a time into your hallway.The ‘bags’ you can pay for are not actually bags, but a ‘tray liner’, the purpose of which defeats me. Perhaps it is to keep your food away from the dirty trays?So excellent timing Tesco, and good to see we are all ‘pulling together’ in defeating Covid.",0,2

Tesco,Discrimination of a disabled person,"I liked to hold onto a hope that Tesco was trying to become more ethical and fair minded but I’ve had to concede that it’s a really rubbish supermarket. People around here avoid it as it has a bad reputation but as a disabled person I don’t have much choice. Generally, the delivery service has been okay as the drivers have always been very lovely and apart from excess plastic bags, the experiences have been fairly smooth.My recent negative personal experience involves my futile attempts at contacting customer service during quarantine to get priority spots for vulnerable people. I had to rely on Tesco deliveries as there is no other option around here. I also had to use email as I have an ear condition and avoid the phone. My queries were disregarded and it was just a matter of luck that my cupboards were quite full so I had something to eat while trying to get slots. I live on my own and could of course not make phone calls to local shops for deliveries, either. Over time that would also have been both complicated and very expensive as they charge about 10% more. I somehow survived. But then when I had a different query in August and brought the matter up, I was told I had to make a phone call. I explained that I can’t do that and after prompting, received another email telling me to make the phone call when I was better. I had explained that I am a chronically ill person with a permanent ear injury that won’t be getting any better! I felt so humiliated. One of the customer team then sent me a few questions that I needed to answer in order to get the slots, but they never got back to me. I kept chasing this as I was now this close to a resolution. In the end someone responded, apologised and explained how to book using the priority slots.Someone had also messed up my recent order so I didn’t get all the products and had to put myself at risk by discussing it with the driver when he came back with the second third of my order. This caused a setback of my ear condition and also made me nervous that I was quite close to the driver (1 m) without masks.",0,1
Tesco,Ridiculous trial using tray liners for deliveries,"This isn't aimed at my local Tesco's but this trial with the tray liners is ridiculous, it's human nature the bigger the bag the more you put in it, so I don't blame the staff because they get told how many trays the shop can have. The tray liners are too heavy as they are full what used to be in 3 bags in a tray is now one big liner. I can now only have a shop when I have help at home as I am unable to lift the tray liners. Eg 4x 1litre bottles, 6 pack of longlife mlk, 2x 1litre squash bottles in one tray liner !!!!Also some drivers are carrying just the liners (not even using the trays) to the houses crushing everything in them because there are no handles. One driver who delivered to me put 2 tray liners one top of the other squashed everything in the bottom liner which you then had to refund. They are a ridiculous idea and if they continue after 14th Sept I will be shopping elsewhere other shops have unbranded carrier bags why can't you.",0,1

Works well at other retailers. The assistant emptied and changed the bin within a metre of me with no mask or name badge. Then she started changing the till roll in the pump, again within a metre of me. No help offered and when I asked if she could perhaps do that in a second when I had gone or step back a little I was told to “stop being a miserable sod and go away”. This sort of language towards customers seems to be in Tesco training as it has happened to others I know, as well as overhearing some less than polite remarks towards customers. Customers obviously not important to them so no need to return, ever!",0,1
Tesco,Tesco have changed the petrol stations…,Tesco have changed the petrol stations to a card operated system which i have used previously.At the weekend i went to fill up and inserted my card and the pin number and the display said remove your card which i did and tried again and it failed so i went into the shop and asked the assistant was there a problem and he kindly came out to the pump and got it working ok so i filled up. This morning i was doing some online banking and noticed 3 payments to tesco 2 for £1 and the 3rd for the petrol purchased so it seems if you put your card into a tesco machine and enter your pin and it fails it will charge you £1 for the privilege which is robbery as there is no mention of this on any point of sale material on the pump.Today i called into the shop to pick a few bits up and whilst at the till the same thing was happening again to another customer who also requested assistance so i told the shop assistant that it would take a £1 payment for failing to work on every occasion you try for no fault of your own.Come on TESCO be honest and let people know and you owe me £2.,0,1

I know Sainsburys and Morrisons also do affordable delivery but their slot availability is a bit hit and miss so I am sticking with Asda until Tesco realise their mistake and go back to original priced deliveries (how about doing special delivery prices for pensioners and care workers - that would be good spate of advertising!!!",0,1

Remedy, ask Sainsbury's. Answer No Problem you can have a one hour slot every week for a £1 del charge. No problems at all including VERY few ok sustitutes always accepted, but there were just one or two things we were used to having from Tesco that we missed so we tried Tesco again in June and got a slot at £2 cheapest del with an 8hr slot, gave them half the shopping, had more problems with their deliveries in 6 weeks than 4 months with Sainsbury's.1st Aug Tesco deliveries went from £2 to £4.50 but I am still paying £1 with Sainsbury's and also still Locked Down despite what the government say.After about 35yrs I have now deserted Tesco all together, except for using the original Tesco VISA Credit Card I have had since they were invented, I keep using his as despite what they might say they can see how much they are losing to Sainsbury's every month!Moral of the story, as far as I am concerned Tesco you have shot yourself in the foot, YET AGAIN!!Try Sainsbury's, they are brilliant!",0,1

Tesco,IS CREATIVE ACCOUNTING JUST ABOUT MONEY??,"After being advised by Tesco that I was one of a number of their customers who had had their Clubcard Account 'compromised' I found that I was having issues with my Delivery Saver Account. After numerous telephone calls from me to Tesco Customer Services and the somewhat incredulous exchanges of emails in which Tesco continued to contradict themselves, it has taken three Customer Service Officers and a further three Customer Service Specialists acting on behalf of the Executive’s Office to establish that Tesco had decided to cancel my Delivery Saver Account without informing me and not my compromised Clubcard Account as had been previously stated they would. Without giving due consideration to my simple and reasonable aim to reinstate or create a Delivery Saver Account Tesco instead offered me £30 of tokens to spend on-line using the Delivery Saver Account that I no longer had??!! Tesco did amend this offer to tokens which could be spent in one of their stores but only after I had pointed out that they had previously advised that they had cancelled my Delivery Saver Account. I am (was) a long standing Tesco customer, currently holding two mobile phone contracts, and previously motor insurance, pet insurance, banking along with spending over £750 per month in the grocery section and yet I am not worthy of being given due consideration. Instead I am expected to accept Tesco “Customer Service Specialists acting on behalf of the Executive’s Office” conclusion that :“I believe my colleague (a fellow Customer Service Specialist acting on behalf of the Executive’s Office) has offered you a fair and reasonable resolution by way of the £30.00 e-coupon"";""Having discussed your contact with my Line Manager I am sorry to say there is no further escalation point higher than this office.”I believe that Tesco have raised many more issues of concern with regards to how they deal with customer complaints than those that I initially brought to their attention. It can be seen that the autonomy exercised by the Customer Service Specialists acting on behalf of the Executive’s Office is a reflection of the autonomy enjoyed by those involved in Tesco's recent creative accounting that was so costly to so many. The Executive's Office hiding away from customer feedback is abdication and not delegation. As this is not rocket science one is left to wonder why this style of management is being employed by Tesco.",0,1

Tesco,Every little (bit of training) helps.,"We don't normally use Tesco for our online shopping, but we do visit Tesco if we're shopping offline. This review is relating to our online experience only. First issue: This was on us. My partner had a moment in which she apparently completely forgot where she lived, and ended up inserting previous address details into the delivery address field. Oops. We received a call from the delivery driver asking where we were and quickly realised the mistake. The delivery driver said not to worry as this kind of thing happens quite often. Understandably, the order the could be delivered the same day due to distances involved. Fair enough. Delivery driver explains that we will receive a call the next morning to reschedule delivery date. We didn't.After noting that the delivery details on the app suggest that the order had been delivered I called the customer service team to find out what was happening. Apparently their systems showed it had failed delivery and hadn't actually been delivered as per the delivery status. The girl on the phone found our order. After 10 minutes of explaining that the order is linked to the wrong address she rescheduled the order for the nearest delivery slot, which is 10 - 11pm tomorrow evening. Just before finishing the call I ask for confirmation that this is to the correct address. It isn't. I am then told that the address cannot be changed from her side and that I have to go online to do it, and will be able to reschedule from there. I go online and change the address. There is no option for rescheduling a delivery that is already confirmed as delivered, even if it isn't.I return to the call centre again. The advisor finds the order under the correct address. I'm advised that there's no availability for delivery for at least a week. I explain that a solution might be that I collect the order from the store. The advisor puts me on hold to call someone to find out if this is possible. Advisor returns and explains it isn't possible. Then goes onto explain that orders that fail delivery are returned to store and restocked, they are then refunded. Not really sure why all call centre staff aren't made aware of this? Could have saved 45 minutes of my life. I check for the refund and it isn't present in my account. I'm told this will take up to 5 working days to be returned. The short of it: Call centre staff appear to be poorly trained, though are trying their best to assist.I'm now left without my order, and don't have any money to create a new order until the refund arrives into my account. We have very little in the cupboards. Despite the initial mistake being on our behalf, the processes thereafter are very poor indeed. No one is aware of the process structure at all. At no point, beyond the delivery driver with incorrect information, has anyone attempted to contact us to make us aware of what's happening. If this had happened to a less-abled elder, or special requirements customer, this could genuinely be a disaster. Sort it out. Thanks for making this week more difficult than it needed to be.

Twice I thanked him for helping me, but no acknowledgement from him at all. I asked him why he ignored me, he said, ""I didn't, it's not my fault, your deaf, then another member of staff, appeared and said,"" HE'S not rude"".. I'm all for solidarity, but she wasn't even present at the time. I am 70, not deaf, and I can see lips move, surprisingly!I have spent 100's of pounds, on deliveries and click and collect from Tesco since the beginning of covid. Bad show TESCO! staff training needed.DR WESTON",0,2
Tesco,I have home delivery,"I have home delivery, from Shoreham,can honestly say that I have had no problems with getting a slot, also no problems with my order,drivers very helpful and curtious, thank you to everyone.",0,5
Tesco,Wow!,Wow!! Well I eventually got a delivery slot after 2 months of relentlessly trying. Then when I went in to adjust order it said ' time slot has expired'. Fraudsters!!! What really annoys me is that the friend that delivers my 'very basic' weekly food gets it from Tesco. Their vegetables are disgusting!! Some are so bad that they hit the bin before even entering the house. (If ever we can get out of 'lockdown'...thank God for Aldi).,0,1
Tesco,My wife and myself at 71 and 70 years…,"My wife and myself at 71 and 70 years old After loyal shopping with our local Tesco in Cullompton Devon since it opened over 12 years ago , for contravening Tesco, one way system we were told by the manager never to return. So I assume we are banned . No WARNING , NO DO NOT DO IT AGAIN.So much for loyalty",0,1
Tesco,Satisfied customer,"I don't know where these poor reviews are coming from. At the beginning of lock down, I tried several supermarkets but Tesco was the one in which it was the easiest to find slots and to be able to book further slots into the future, which was very reassuring. Yes, it was difficult to find slots at first, but less so than the other supermarkets, and the service was soon up and running smoothly. The drivers for home deliveries are always helpful and keep their social distancing and I have had very few issues with supply. Substitutions if more expensive, are not charged for, which is not always the case with other supermarkets, and there is a wide range of food to choose from at a reasonable price. Offers are shown clearly too.",0,5
Tesco,This is for Tesco at Pitsea,This is for Tesco at Pitsea. To most of the staff doing a great job and to the job opportunity offered to our local young people .

Tesco,Filey Girls,"I would like to thank Gill, Natalie, Sarah with the pony tail, and Pauline for making my day. We have a laugh all together. It’s always nice to see smiling and happy faces too!

I will be using Tesco far more going forward. Thank you!",0,5
Tesco,I'd like to say a big Thank you to Paul…,"I'd like to say a big Thank you to Paul (The outside trolly attendant, Bletchley Milton Keynes) for his help in these testing times. Every time he sees us he let's us straight in, regardless to what everyone else queuing has to say to him. Today he had to deal with a lot of unhappy people. Asking why we get to go ahead of the rest. My Fiancé is a Prison officer and shows his ID every time so we can get into the shop and home as quickly as possible. He just like the NHS have continued to work hard regardless of the pandemic. Prison staff are the forgotten hero's, the don't get recognition like NHS staff do, so it's really lovely of Paul to show my Fiancé this kind of appreciation. I wish there were more people like Paul in the world, as it would sure make the world a nicer place. Thank you Paul, from our family to yours. For all that you are doing in these testing times. Stay safe.",0,5

Tesco,Great Service But.......,"We usually shop at Aldis but because they don't offer a home delivery service, we turned to Tesco during the current crisis. For ease of ordering including finding slots, we give 5 stars and for the drivers, all pleasant and cheerful, we also give 5 stars. The availability of products ordered gets another 5 stars. However, there the excellence ends! Tesco's current TV campaign about matching Aldi's prices, gets blown out of the window when we compared the Tesco total which was around 20% higher than what we would usually pay at Aldi. That said, we are well aware that in the current situation, beggars can't be choosers. Our biggest gripe however, is the fact that some drivers stand at the other side of the box less than 2 feet away while we lift out the bags. The safest driver, a woman, carried the bags over from her van and walked back for more while we carried the first lot inside. Tesco need to hammer home the stay safe message to all home delivery drivers!!!",0,3

Tesco,Excellent service.,I have shopped on line with Tesco for several years now and never had a bad experience. On the rare occasion when something has been missing I have been refunded immediately. Their customer service I have found to be excellent unlike Asda’s who on the one occasion I spoke to them showed no interest at all in what I was saying and just hung up. All the drivers I have met have been polite and respectful. I will continue to shop with Tesco as I believe them to be by far the best in the Scunthorpe area.,0,5

I'm not vunerable or self isolating but due to having no transport & location within the town it's difficult for me to shop so home delivery is almost essentialTESCO slogan of "" every little helps"" should be changed to "" VERY LITTLE DONE TO HELP""",0,1
Tesco,Terrible delivery service,"Having found a slot for the second time since lockdown began, my wife being officially high risk, after a wait of 10 days they made the delivery on time. Several items were missing, including items my wife has been ordered to eat by her doctor. In addition, there were wrong items, and several damaged items. On being called, they stated that they were too busy to correct the order. Suggest that no-one use them if they have any alternative.",0,1

Tesco,"Shoddy, Shoddy, Shoddy and unacceptable!","OK, firstly I know these are difficult times. Having been requested by the NHS to shield I am reliant on companies like Tesco to bring me what I need first time - there's no safe popping out to buy what they screw up.This week - I ordered AAA batteries for my TV remote as the existing ones are becoming iffy. Batteries came - they were AA and were packed with fresh food!So if the virus does not get me Tesco are hoping maybe they can poison me.Last week, having ordered 2 packs of fresh mint (if you like Mojitos you will know how important it is) - I got charged for 2 packs BUT only 2 came with an expiry date of the day delivered and it was marked down. So effectively being charged for 2 good packs and have half that amount of expiring products delivered.Its not good enough and as a result I am facing having to break the shielding to be able to get what I need rather than rely on shoddy customer services which, no doubt, will be blamed on the pandemic.AFTERNOTE: When I spoke to customer services they said they were getting a manager to call me over the failure - guess what - Tesco did not even do that!",0,1

After cueing for 20 mins with 2 other people in front of me, I counted 12 people come out before I managed to get in ? I did get some potato’s and milk cheaper than aldi, But that was about it. I think I saved about 20p that’s 1p per min for cueing. Not worth the wait. I won’t be going there anymore.",0,1
Tesco,Online delivery.,"Have had recent online deliveries from Tesco Lakeside. My wife has been selected as coronarvirus vulnerable. Although it has taken a while we are now on their vulnerable list and it is easier to get delivery slot. Some concerns about raised prices, but I am very thankful to everyone at the store who risk catching the virus to allow us to get food delivered. We often used to shop at Tesco Lakeside because it is free and easy to park near the entrance unlike Morrison Grays, Tesco have a huge range and selection of groceries, shelves are usually well stocked and full unlike Asda Tilbury, and own brand stuff is a good price and reasonable quality.",0,3

Tesco,Slots available for new customers only!!,I WAS a loyal customer who has been signed up to their delivery saver plan for years and getting regular deliveries. I understand that with the current climate delivery slots should be available for vulnerable customers BUT... I tried making a new account and low and behold delivery slots were available. Why can I get a slot as a new customer but not as an existing customer?,0,1
Tesco,Definitely 5 stars!,I can't say anything bad about shopping at tesco.I always enjoying there a lots of stuff and nice cloths.Self checkouts with glass barriers excellent improvement under coronavirus.So definitely 5 stars!,0,5
Tesco,Like most despite being a loyal…,Like most despite being a loyal customer for many years have been unable to book a slot. Have had to go to local store where arrows have been added to floor to aid social distancing however most people just ignore them and the staff make no attempt to enforce them. My main issue is staffs attitude to social distancing regularly chatting in groups and walk past you at checkout. On my last visit a staff member was standing right by the exit blocking my path on her phone and seemed inconvenienced when I asked her to move away. Tesco are obviously doing well out of this crisis but I for one will not forget there treatment of loyal customers when things improve.,0,1
Tesco,No deliveries to flats...,Tesco have told their drivers to only deliver to the first outside door of the building including flats. Hence yesterday when my order arrived the driver told me he wasn’t coming up to my apartment (there is a lift) I would have to go down and collect the shopping. So 15 minutes later having lugged numerous bags ( all tied with the handle nothing to carry them by) I finally got my shopping. In my mid 60’s a career for my husband this is the last thing I needed. Tesco have made me go against the government guidelines. We have been in strict isolation for 6 weeks as hubby is in the vulnerable category and now I have broken the isolation. This a huge problem for anyone in flats. Shame on you Tesco . You are not looking after anybody but yourself.,0,1

Tesco,"No compassion, no care","To begin my review I would like to commend all the staff that are working in Tescos, you are all doing an excellent job so well done all of you. My complaint is with Tesco management of the elderly and vunerable people who have regularly had orders delivered but since the virus have been unable to obtain slots. Our awful situations have not been addressed or dealt with any compassion at all. I have shopped with Tescos for many years and had my orders delivered but now I cannot find any slots. When I confronted Tesco customer services I was met with indifference and a suggestion that I contact Age Concern. My wife has Heart disease and many other health problems and I am 77 but Tesco didn't want to know. I live in Wales so no lists on Government website to join. Sorry Tesco but this is very badly done and you should be ashamed. You have my details on record and yet people who have never shopped with you before are getting priority. I have to keep going out every and pray that I don't catch the virus. Thanks Tesco for nothing, literally.",0,1

That was over and above excellent service! Thank you Tesco for top staff! Ive tried to get his name and make sure he gets the credit. Phone line isnt great at the moment but I will get through!",0,5
Tesco,Regarding a recent delivery,"Regarding a recent delivery, I ordered their meal deal, you get main meal, sides, choice of drinks, and dessert for 2 people. But as only the potato based sides were available this is what they delivered as all the other 3 ""Meal Deal"" remaining items I ordered were not available and nothing suitable to substitute instead, apparently - it was therefore pointless sending just this one item.Also, another problem was regarding their grocery packing as heavy items were placed on top of the bread I ordered, the loaf was significantly quashed, not surprisingly.You cannot contact Tesco through email or contact form and having had a poor service from their call centre in the past I do not want to contact them by telephone.",0,1
Tesco,Tesco Paisley,"Tesco PaisleyEast LaneI find it incredible that I go into a store and spend another chunk of my hard earned cash in a place where, when I reach the self service checkouts, I'm met by a grim faced employee who only raised a smile and a cheery greeting once while I was there. That was when a Supervisor/Manager appeared.We all know these times are stressful but I still don't think I should have to put up with someone's obvious dislike of their job and the people, ie customers, who keep her in it. Maybe Tesco are trying to discourage people coming in. Who knows.PS. The price of the hand wash I usually buy in Tesco increased by 30p since the Coronavirus pandemic took hold. Talk about opportunist and exploitative. Good old Tesco.",0,1
Tesco,Useless tesco,"i have to say I am disgusted at Tesco s new policy of forcing the disabled and elderly to go to their stores to get shopping,how many of these people relied on home deliveries b fore the current crisis,now ,despite the govt saying the elderly and disabled should self isolate Tesco are now forcing these vulnerable people to get on public transport or taxis and go do your shopping in store because they are unable to deliver,it is ridiculous,how many of these people raid on Tesco home deliveries before the crisis and how many now being put at risk because Tesco are not doing enough to help these already vulnerable people, I myself relied on their home delivery I am in a wheelchair and do not drive ,I have asthma and had pneumonia twice ,how many of Tesco s customers who relied on their home delivery are now being ignored and forced to put themselves at risk to save Tesco from helping,I will not be a customer any longer with Tesco I will NOT support a company who has not supported me or the rest of the vulnerable people",0,1
Tesco,Treated badly in Tesco!,"The one way system had been implemented (Glastonbury) inbetween visits & I hadn't realised, too busy looking at the items not the floor, as I stepped a meter up an aisle to get bin bags. I was told I had to go around (the next 2 aisles were downward arrows also meaning I had a long walk round, coming into more contact with others) then back down to the bottom where I already was. I asked if I could just take them as I was standing right there. The girl was so sarcastic and rude in her reply making fun of me to a lad stocking shelves and infront of other customers.I was so embarrassed I can't bring myself to go in there again. Subsequently I went to Morrisons, safe practices, happy staff but allowing us to have the common sense to stay 2m apart from each other. An altogether much better experience!",0,1

Tesco,Tesco Northampton - Awful experience,"Having recently been into Tesco Northampton (Mereway) I can only assume that Tesco have completely lost the plot. The entire over the top layout with floor arrows and cordoned off sections means that you're directed to move in a certain direction and you're not allowed to come back on yourself. God forbid you forget something. The staff treat you like cattle as you're pushed along through the aisles. A truly terrible experience with no common sense being applied. They must be losing customers left, right and centre.It's like a scene out of the walking dead with no-entry tape and barricades.I'm sure some retailers will come out of this positively (Asda, Aldi, Lidl) where as others (Tesco!) will look at there fallen market share and question how the hell did we balls this one up!! I can only assume that the outgoing CEO is on a mission to mess things up before he swans off :)Nice work Tesco!",0,1
Tesco,A really poor and needlessly stressful experience,"Four observations I made on my recent visit to Tesco. 1) To enter the store, we had to go up and down two sets of walking floors and around a basement car park (around 400 metres) in order to enter the store. I also noticed the Tesco staff letting a particular person (wearing garb of a particular religion), barge into the queue. (there may have been a reason for this.2) In the store, I observed a man (wearing garb of a particular religion) filling his deep trolley with over 20 bags of potatoes. So much for the maximum three items. (perhaps he did not go to the checkout but that is illogical)3) So much confusion at the checkout.4) A security guard outside attempting to move me on despite my observing social distancing but just resting. I have hereditary neuropathy affecting my peripheral nerves. In this moment I needed to rest and he attempted to harass me within two minutes of my sitting down. I sent him away immediately and on his second attempt told him to observe social distancing. I also noticed him approach a young man with a child and an old lady who moved away immediately. Shame on you Tesco. I doubt you will see my custom in the immediate future…",0,1
Tesco,"Tesco Shaftsbury, Dorset.","Tesco Shaftsbury, are making a right pig's ear of store rules related to covid-19.

Tesco, leave customers to use their own common sense concerning social distancing, yours would be better served with a temporary closure of customer self scanning and a screen to protect your checkout staff that is long overdue.",0,1

Tesco forgets about us no slots available yet other people who never shopped before are getting slots through switching addresses with other shoppers.

The ‘doorman’ told her she could not go in and made her wait despite the next lady in the queue saying it was fine for her to go in first. But the door man insisted she waited. She stood there stooped with shaking legs and holding on to the bin but still the door guard would not allow her to move. Several people went in before she was allowed entry.This happened and 18.50 today 4th April and I really think it needs to be mentioned to them, particularly as your adverts on the tv profess that you are a caring supermarket.",0,1

My intention was to pick up a trolley at the entrance to do a weekly grocery shop for my 80 year old “shielded” mother. The young lady at the door asked us if we were together. When explaining the situation that 2 separate shops were being done for 2 separate households we were told that only one of us could enter the store. I completely understand the premise of allowing one person per household to shop for that house. I, however, was shopping ONLY for my mother in a completely different household!! It was utterly ridiculous. For goodness sake, Tesco, apply some common sense!! My husband advised that the shelves were poorly stocked. Nothing new for this Tesco store I have to be honest!I promptly returned to my car and shopped at Morrison’s for my mother! I will never shop in this particular Tesco ever again. Shocking!",0,1

Tesco,Good experience in store today,"Last week I went to my local store (Clevedon) and had a horrendous experience - shelves empty, no social distancing, queues filling up every aisle for checkouts making shopping difficult, etc. What a difference a week makes! Yes, today I had to queue to enter (for about 30 min after parking) due to restriction of 50 customers in store at any one time, but the queue was very well managed by friendly staff (though I guess it wouldn’t be any fun in the rain!). In store, shelves were well stocked under the circumstances - just two (non-essential) items on my long shopping list were unavailable - everyone kept their 2 m distance, and there was no wait at all for a checkout. I’d been expecting the worst - I’m not quite old enough to qualify for one of the ‘special’ hours for over-70s - and ended up very pleasantly surprised - and I won’t need to go shopping again for at least 2-3 weeks! Thank you, Tesco!",0,5

I tried to call thier Customer Service Line this morning, got through ok and followed all the instructions to get to the correct choice - online slots - recorded message and then line went dead. I then looked on line, no info at all. I then took the e-mail address form the website for the customer service team, wrote an enquiry email and sent - bounced because the e-mail address is no longer monitored!

Then in store a lady which was older than me (I'm 45) purposely sneezed, coughed as she passes by us. My husband and I looked at her and and said ""hilarious"" she replied ""yeah you are-look at you both"" Other comments were made by others laughing etc...We have done nothing to them or caused anyone any harm and for all she knows I could be a vulnerable person or a member of my family could be. This shows how childish and ignorant people are and don't care about anyone not even themselves in this serious unpresidented situation never seen before.

Today, I witnessed a local shop keeper by around 21 loaves of bread, 80-100 bananas and various other stock to be sold on for profit. Would it not be easier to just allow 3 loves of bread per person for example? Also, I really dont think that anybody would be too concerned if the number of items of one type was reduced to two.By the way, well done to all your staff who are currently working at this stressful time!",0,3

No explanation whatsoever.So at a stroke, my business of £2500 per annum, £26000 in total, went elsewhere.Mind you, I'm not missing them.

Tesco,This store would have got no stars but…,"This store would have got no stars but that is not possible to do on here.Tesco Uxbridge is the worst store in Uxbridge. Since a lot of staff took""retirement"" or""redundncy"" as Tesco put it, due to knew contracts that a majority did not want to sign, which meant that staff that had for many years worked on check outs and were women in their 40+ age range did not want to sign the new contracts as they would then be expected to not only work on check outs but also on the shop floor and shelf filling, which can be heavy work. So now it is understaffed and a majority of the new employees have no communication skills and also rude and ignorant. One member of staff actually open up a checkout with his over ear headphones wrapped around his neck and others constantly checking their mobiles on the shop floor.They have removed the bakery and replaced it with a Tesco mobile phone shop, which always seems empty and seems pointless having it there. The store has been moved around and impossible to find items, if they still actually stock them as they have reduced the lines they stock and just seem to fill the gaps with lots of the same items. the chiller cabinets are constantly empty and always finding out of date stock on the shelves, which include milk that was 4 days past the use by date on it,even though I had reported it to a member of staff 2 days earlier, but nothing done about it. At the moment of writing this review there is no frozen items at all as they have been replacing the freezers overnight and taking them ages to get them installed,working and to be replenished.Nearly everyday I go in their there are no baskets at the front of the store,so I have to walk to a checkout to get one.There never seems to be any staff on the shop floor to ask about anything, although I doubt they would know the answer anyway.A few days ago I was in there and there was only one checkout open and the self service checkouts,but there was a queue of 30 people waiting in it and 10 in the other checkout. Despite them now wearing the headsets to communicate to each other, nothing seems to happen about opening more checkouts. They are constantly running out of carrier bags and on some of the checkouts the belts don't work so you have to keep your basket on it and push it along as you get closer to eventually getting served.There never seems to be any management on the shop floor and never seen a store manager in their since the change of contracts. The only person I have seen and spoken to about these major problems is a Duty Manager called Bev who now looks exhausted all the time, which is not surprising as she has to deal with these poorly trained staff who have basically no idea what they are doing.They should have shut the store, made the improvements and properly train the staff and then reopen it, but Tesco's do not seem to care about their customers anymore or the type of staff they no employ. I have been shopping in there for over 35 years and the store over the last few years have had problems, but nothing like it is now. The store in general is disgusting and if it was a horse it would have been shot to put it out of it's misery, but it's not and we the customers that pay their wages and managements bonuses are expected o just put up with it.So Mr David Lewis, if you get to read this I suggest you make a surprised and unexpected visit to the store to see for yourself, if you can be bothered to leave your comfy office chair and see what us your customers are expected to deal with everyday in this atrocious store and do something about it!!",0,1

I went back to the mobile phone company who gave me the code they had used which is one used not for Investments but for insurance. Tesco will not accept this . They have refunded the fee but of course it also accrues interest and could affect my credit rating. I have been told today that I will not be charged interest but the tone of the “customer care staff is appalling” they are rude do not even bother to Use common niceties like please and thank you . I am appalled that they cannot even been bothered to apologise or be transparent about their error. Those of you who use this credit card -scrutinise your transactions between statements.

Even the shelf space for packed fresh(?) meat has been reduced by 50%. Where are meat eaters supposed to go? Is this a vegan plot?

A melon has not ripened after two weeks either although I would not call it a total disaster like the kiwis. I also bought a “perfectly ripe” mango from which I could not release the stone without a very sharp knife which left the mango halves looking hacked-about. Some perfection! What a pity my nearest Aldi is four miles away, but next time I think I will get out the car. The cost savings should far outweigh the petrol and I will be much surer of getting quality stuff.

Tesco,DIRTY CLOTHING AND BAD ATTITUE,"Saw a nice fluffy pink bathrobe for £20, went to the till to pay for it then noticed the belt was dirty, it looked like it had been stood on, I had other shopping to pay for and the store was busy,I asked the cashier if someone would get another one, she said I would be quicker going myself. Got one quickly but now there were a fewpeople in line to be served, cashier was bagging the bathrobe when I noticed the hem of this one was dirty, cashier said they must all be like that because they were long and dragging the ground, then she said it was just dust and did I still want it, I said no and said I would order on online and mentioned click and collect, at that another lady in line said they don't do that here, really angry at this attitude.This is a large store in Falkirk.",0,2

Tesco,decline of tesco ramsbottom,"I've been shopping at this store 4 times a week since it opened. The staff were wonderful, helpful and friendly.Recent redundencies have left staff who are impersonal at best and inefficient at worse. Empty shelves have become the norm over the last 18 months. The beginning of the week was bad.It was past 8.30 when I had to ask for sandwiches which I was told that they'd only just arrived. Had the drinks for the cooling cabinet also just arrived funny tht there were plenty on the normal shelves. no wonder Morrison's and Aldi are doing well these shops seem to be better run.

Tesco,Rude and disrespectful,Rude and disrespectful . DUNSTABLE EXTRA STOREWent there this evening to do my weekly shop. I usually go with my wife who keeps tokens for the trolley but today I went alone and I didnt have a pound coin or a token. I asked the customer desk for a token but they didnt keep them so I went and got £20 from the machine and went back to the customer desk to get change but after 5 mins of waiting i decided to ask the cigarette kiosk attendant for change. I waited in the queue and when it was my turn I asked the cashier for change but out of the blue she shouted at me about something. When She finally managed to stop her tantrum she gave me change. I went and got a trolley and I thought I would just let it go but as I walked between the isles I was too upset to continue so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager apologised but not too convincing. She was not sincere or genuine. After speaking to the manager I tried to carry on with my shopping but I was too frustrated so I left.This is not the first time I experience prejudice..being from an ethnic minority is an invitation for people to take advantage of you and disrespect you. I am sure I contributed 10 fold more than the woman in the kiosk did yet it counted for nothing because of my colour. My ethnicity gave the attendant the right to shout at me. People may deny it is the case but unless you were an ethnic yourself you wouldn't know. I blame tesco for their failing to teach their staff to respect all kind of people and treat people equally.I dont feel the manager did enough to convince me she will deal with the problem. I would have liked the kiosk attendant to have apologised for her unacceptable behaviour and irate. I hope Tesco management deals with this adequately. I would like a proper apology!,0,1
Tesco,Thank you and much appreciated.......,"A big thank you and much appreciation..... returned a faulty printer cartridge purchased in April 2019. In April, I purchased an original HP ink cartridge, for a small home HP printer. About a month ago, I needed to change the ink and used the cartridge purchased in April. To my horror after, just one use, the ink cartridge was unrecognisable and would not print. Fortunately I had kept my original receipt and decided to return the item to my local Tesco store. To be honest, I was a little unsure because of the time factor and I didn’t have the original packaging. Too my surprise, the lady at the customer service desk provided me with a £20.70 gift card for the value of the cartridge. This is a very good example of customer care. Well done and thank you Tesco.",0,4

Tesco,Contaminated Food Cover Up.,"Just over a week ago, we bought some 'Extra Special' bread from Tesco Extra at Lunsford Park, Aylesford. The following morning I ate two pieces, heavily laden in Peanut Butter, as I do every morning. As I was just finishing the second piece, my wife bit into hers, spat it out and told me that it was mouldy. Too late for me. Anyway, later that day my stomach was rumbling and I had diarrhoea through to the following day. The following day, when I was feeling better, I took it back to Tesco, explained what had happened and the CS rep sounded very concerned. She recorded it as a complaint and guaranteed me that the bread would be kept in a Freezer Unit until the investigation was complete. A few days later I was E-mailed by Tesco Complaints team. They informed me that the intended to take no action as there was no proof that my illness was as a result of eating their Bread. Even though, apart from the Peanut Butter, I hadn't eaten anything else. I then requested a sample of the bread back, so that I could take the matter to Trading Standards. I was informed that, due to 'human error' the bread had been destroyed at the store. I contacted Tesco Aylesford, who informed me that the Bread had been sent to the Complaints Department. Someone is lying to me.Now this stinks to me of a cover up. OK, it only gave me Diarrhoea for a day, but I'm fit and healthy. What might have happened if someone had eaten it who was older, frailer or whose immune system was weaker? Tesco, as are other such Supermarkets, are under a duty of care to their customers, which Tesco don't seem overly concerned about. I know, I was naïve to trust Tesco, but after being a loyal customer for decades, I had hoped for a little more.I'm putting this out there just to warn people about the potential dangers of buying from your local Tesco store.I phoned the store again to a ask to speak to a Manager, to ask them if they wanted to make a comment. There wasn't anyone available. So, I asked that someone ring me back. They've chosen not to do so. So, if anyone from Tesco does wish to contact me personally, or make a comment, please feel free to update this Review.",0,1

Tesco,"Tesco Vouchers Deducted From Total Shop, No Fuel Voucher Issued","On arrival at Tesco 15/8/2019, and the advertising of “5p a litre off fuel if you spend £60 or more” and as we were planning to spend more than £60 we expected to receive a voucher at the checkout. To our surprise, a voucher was not automatically generated and the operator was unable to answer why this should be the case and were asked to visit Customer Service. At Customer Service, we were advised that the reason a voucher was not generated “was because of Scottish Licencing Laws”. This did not seem to match our previous shopping experience, where we had received Fuel voucher when spending just over £60. In addition, as those who shop at Tesco will testify, the numerous Billboards and Alcohol Aisle advertising DOES NOT mention it does not apply to Alcohol. Time to phone Tesco! After several minutes explaining the above over the phone, a further wait of several minutes and remote examination, by the telephone operator of our bill, it transpired that it was NOT the Scottish Alcohol Laws, but our use of Tesco Money off Vouchers (the type you get for spending money at Tesco’s) were the actual culprit.Again, nothing in the BOLD advertising states that it is the final total generated, following Tesco, and presumably other voucher deduction, that determines if a Fuel Voucher is generated or not. Beware, Tesco have many ways of ensuring Apparent Value, is not the same as real value.",0,1

Tesco,Goodbye Tesco Online,"Tesco online service has made me leave a company I have shopped with for years and previously looked up to. Why does Tesco think they can palm off all of the products that are coming up to their sell by date?On my last delivery I had to use up several fresh products within the first few days due to the sell by dates all coming up together and had to shop for more food for dinners later in the week. I checked my latest delivery today when I noticed that some pork pie delivered three days ago was already out of date and noticed that there were more items in my fridge out of date. One of the product's sell by date was the date it was delivered and a bottle of channel island milk sell by date was the following day. Only my husband uses the milk and cannot drink a bottle in one day. Fair enough customer service have refunded the money for these products but it has cost me precious time phoning the customer services and I now have to go shopping to replace these products, which defeats the object of shopping online. I urge all customers shopping online to check sell by dates and phone customer service. As a retired customer service trainer I was not impressed with the customer service assistant's response, as I felt she could have been more apologetic, rather than telling me fruit and vegetables can be used after the sell by date and also saying that Tesco give short delivery dates because they don't like waste (so this is something you have to put up with if you shop online).I have had to give one star but this goes to the van driver/ delivery men who have always been lovely. Sorry Tesco, I will be shopping with Morrisons in future. Now I know why there are not many Tesco delivery vans around these days.Incidentally, my elderly sister is very upset that you have stopped allowing people to pay for bags online as her mobility is very bad and she cannot carry her shopping into her kitchen individually.

Tesco,Bad customer service costs as customers vote with their feet.,"I have been a customer at Tesco for many years. We moved house so began using the local store in Galashiels, Scottish Borders.The store had no wine for the 'meal deal' I was told by a member of store staff to select a wine up to the value of £7. When I got to the check out someone needed to come with a code. This person told me there was meal deal wine available and I had been looking in the wrong place! (Wine is always displayed in the same place). He went to fetch the wine. He returned with wine, which was not the meal deal wine but probably the cheapest wine they sold in the store. He removed the wine I had selected from the conveyor belt in exchange for the bottle he selected.This member of staff was clearly not at all customer focused. He was rude and made me feel as though I were stupid and a liar. This attitude has cost Tesco my custom. I will not be returning.I made a complaint at the customer service desk and weeks have passed and no one from the store management has had the courtesy to contact me to discuss the situation, so my relationship with Tesco is severed. Loyalty counts for nothing and with all the current economic uncertainties, I would have thought retaining customers a priority; obviously not.Goodbye Tesco. Plenty of other retailers out there.",0,1

The side facing the plate hadn’t been toasted. The following day I mentioned to customer services and was led to the cafe. The woman on there said that’s how they are meant to be. She said this abruptly in fact quite rudely. I’ve been in the catering trade and know how a toastie should be done and this was definitely not to standard.

When I had finished they stopped the rollator so that I could actually ride it down! I was very impressed but not surprised as I have always found the staff very helpful. As it is going to take 8 weeks to get repaired they have purchased 4 new mobility scooters and a stairlift for disabled customers. Thank you Tesco!",0,5
Tesco,Finest corn-fed chickens - tasteless,"With regards to Tesco Express in Ashstead I have to question the quality of the chicken sold under their ""finest"" label.I am a Chef by trade and have eaten both these corn-fed birds versus the regular Tesco chickens.It is my opinion that the run of the mill chickens are far superior in taste and save one a whopping ""fiver"" per bird.Please stock the usual Tesco bird? Unfortunately I don't buy that this is due to consumer preference alone? Does anyone else agree?",0,2
Tesco,Tesco Leytonstone store,"Leytonstone store closed all of its staffed checkouts at approx 10pm leaving only self checkout. With a near to full weeks shop I started to scan the shopping. Early in the process a bottle of wine fell and smashed in front of the checkout. I was left to continue with wine and glass at my feet. When I asked if there was anyone who could clear the mess so I wouldn't slip I was told that there wasn't a cleaner. No-one brought even blue roll to mop up the liquid. Within this time the floor manager had opened and started to serve at a checkout. A member of staff who had finished their shift and was purchasing shopping at an adjacent self service point to me said 'that's what happens when they close all the checkouts, why don't you use another till'. The reason I didn't move was I had gone too far with scanning the contents of the trolley. At no point did anyone else suggest or offer to assist to move to another self service till point or recognise that in fact the quatity of shopping would best have been processed at the till point where the manager was now situated. Once completed there was then an issue with the weight of purchases at the point of payment. The operative manning the self checkout 'told' me to to place some of the items back in the basket so that I could pay.Having struggled to scan, pay and load the shopping while being left with wine and broken glass at my feet, I went over to the manager at the till and asked, could it possibly be true that there was no-one available to have cleared the mess, to which she replied, 'no, not after 9pm'Surely the floor manager should have had another team member on the till so that she could manage the store and assess and act on incidents that happen.Funny because as I was leaving someone miracurously found a mop. Teaco please check footage of this area for Monday 21 January from approx 10.15pm to 10.43pm which is when I paid, for the travisty you call customer care and service. No-one in that team seems to have a scooby about health and safety.Further more I then went to the store today to the pharmacy area. I was directed to look in the vitamin area for a product, which I was unable to locate. I approached the person again in the pharmacy (a person who had previously worked on the customer service desk) if they could possibly help me, to which she replied that the pharmacy team don't manage that area. How unhelpful, but she did know that it was in that area, why not assist? The pharmacy wasn't busy at that time! Time to talk with colleagues though!If I could have left this review with no star rating I would have!",0,1

Tesco,Worst delivery and service,"Worse delivery and customer service I have ever had. Firstly the delivery was late, OK I received a text saying the delivery was late and I can handle that I drive every day and get that sometimes late deliveries can’t be avoided. The driver turned up and left in such a hurry he did not deliver our freezer goods, so I call and get told that they can’t deliver the goods because it’s too hard to do the 40 mile round trip and they can’t do it tomorrow either and also to cap it all I can’t get a refund until they check the vehicle to see whether the goods are there, guessing I must be lying then?Well you know what Tesco, I’ve been getting a delivery from you for the last two years without complaint so I figure if we are going to judge trustworthiness, credibility and honesty, I would tick all the boxes. You won’t get any more business from me as long as I draw breath and failing to deliver goods that I have paid for is a breach of my consumer rights so I had better get my refund and I’m not going to let this go.",0,1

Putting size aside, the chicken was ‘over cooked’ not by a little but by a lot. The breast meat was dry and hard and the whole chicken was inedible.

Tesco,Tesco Frozen Steak Cut Oven Chips,"Tesco Frozen Steak Cut Oven Chips. Avoid at all costs unless you have lost all your teeth. I bought these to try out as they were slightly cheaper than my usual brand. I oven-cooked them as suggested on the packet and they ended up with the consistency of mashed potatoes. Then tried deep frying them, with the same results. Goodness only knows what type of potato they are using but certainly not chipping spuds. Not only a waste of money, but really disappointing if a nice steak and chips is your one weekly treat. Stick to McCain's or Aunt Bessie's. Better still grow your own.",0,1
Tesco,SHOCKING Home DELIVERY service,"Customers BEWARE. UNRELIABLE grocery delivery service! They'll leave you in the lurch without any warning! I've just had an operation and I'm unable to shop right now. With my cupboards empty I ordered food supplies online from Tesco and arranged Home Delivery for 10 to 2pm today (Friday Nov 9). On Fri morning I received a notification that my order would arrive between 10am and 12 noon. It hadn't arrived by 1.30pm so I phoned Tesco. They advised me the delivery driver had logged it as a failed delivery due to customer being not home (this was a lie because I WAS at home). I asked Tesco Customer Services why the driver hadn't telephoned me from outside as they are suppose to do. Tesco investigated. When they got back to me what they told me shocked and disgusted me. They said that the driver had logged it as a failed delivery when in actual fact he hadn't attempted delivery at all. Apparently he'd run out of time on his delivery shift so he lied, logged it as a failed delivery (saying I wasn't home when actually I was) and left - without even messaging me to warn me my delivery had been cancelled! Later I discovered out the driver had never said any such thing and that Customer Services had misled me. Tesco then advised me they couldn't offer any solution for my failed order, they wouldn't even offer a delivery later today! Tesco should be ashamed of themselves. This is a terrible way to run your business and it's a disgusting way to mistreat your customers! This is the second Home Delivery in a row that has been botched up by Tesco. I shall now be switching my supplier. Tesco are obviously unable to manage the job. Home Delivery is no use to me at all if my groceries don't get delivered at the pre-arranged time. Update: Saturday 10 Nov. Yesterday afternoon I sent a complaint email to the Chairman of Tesco uk. Last night at 9pm I received a call from Tesco logistics apologising and offering to specially send out my shopping order later that evening. It arrived just before 10pm. The logistics chap told me the original driver (yesterday morning) had not logged it as a failed delivery (due to the customer not being at home) i fact he had cancelled the delivery while in transit because his shift had ended. I'm told that for some unknown reason (Tesco protocol) my postcode is the last address on their daily delivery schedule. When he ran out of time on his shift yesterday he bumped my name off the delivery list. Furthermore the chap said that Tesco Customer Services were completely wrong to mislead me into thinking that the driver had said he failed the delivery because the customer was not at home. I mention all this because because I want to HIGHLIGHT THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION that seems to be so common these days between ONLINE RETAILERS their DELIVERY COURIERS and their CUSTOMERS. It's always the customer who has to bare the brunt of the mistakes though - and it shouldn't be! For the last 7 days I've suffered the same experience from another well known online retailer and their delivery couriers and I'm sick of it. Don't sell stuff in you can't deliver it!",0,1

The agent suggested I allow substitutions to stop the problem. So customers should buy what they have in stock rather than what you actually want. Found the agents attitude to be poor and he certainly lacked the skills required to work in customer services. Lesson learned",0,1

Mostly double the price. Four hours and I was done. Not. The delivery slot had gone. Had to settle for much later in the week. Ok then. A trip to the co-op to keep me going. Imagined they might send some of their more grotty stuff. Not a bit of it. As fresh and good as bought in store. Really pleased. Suppose about a dozen orders so far. Very few niggles. There was one guy running late. Thought he was going to dump the stuff on my doorstep. Put on my helpless face. He relented. Absolute cheek really. Had paid £4/5 whatever for delivery and waited in. Told Tesco. Not expecting anything. Got back to me quickly. Big apology. Refunded the delivery charge. Gave me £10 voucher. Very impressed. Money went on chocs of course. Never saw the delivery guy again. Never had the problem again. Another time bag of nuts was broken. Some missing. Full refund. I got to keep the bag. Got shopping down to about one hour. Double the time it took to whiz round the store. Shopping with my feet up. Cant be bad. One thing I dont like tho. They charge a lot extra for delivery at weekends. Unfair really.

Even though I had been allowed into the store after this incident and also interviewed by the manager for a vacancy in the same store. The management for tesco are nothing but liars and think they have power due to their job role. Just a complete and utter joke. All they care about is hitting their sales targets to receive their large yearly bonuses. They couldn't give a toss about honest customers. Do yourself a favour and do your shopping elsewhere. They have much more friendlier staff at Morrison's and at least treat you with respect. And whatever you do, DO NOT ever get a job with this company. They treat you like a number, couldn't care less about you. Will have you working all stupid ridiculous hours without proper breaks. You will have no social or family life working for this sh1t company!!!**Update**I was called by Becky the store manager who advised that I am not banned she just asked me not to come into the store. Even though it states on email from customer services that I am. She said she is unable to ban the other customer as me being assaulted in Tesco is not a tesco issue. So therefore it's ok for a customer to be assaulted in Tesco and nothing gets done about it...

I was then removed from the shop. I reported this to the CEO of Tesco, but I had no assistance from them over the matter. I was told after nearly 2 months well report it to the police. The CEO office is a waste of time, I reported it to the police but was told that shops only keep CCTV for 4 weeks. So seams Tescos CEO office wasted time deliberately.

I went for my diabetic eye test during which I suffered a hypo none of the staff in vision express had any knowledge or experience concerning this very serious illness. I even check with the Tesco manager who also did not understand about diabetes. I had a 7 mile journey back home and only just made it . I feel if any company is offering diabetics a service there staff should should be educated regarding this serious illness before someone dies.,0,2
Tesco,Never Again!,"Having fallen out with Tesco a few years ago over appalling service, I decided for some strange reason to give them another chance.A friend is off work ill & has just got into Game of Thrones - his wife bought him Season 1,2 & 3 in a boxed set. He loved them that much that I decided to buy him season 4.I went to my local Tesco in Crewe, found the item, paid the £18 & took it to him. All was going fine until the disc jammed on the penultimate episode. The player was checked & it was ok, it was the disc. I collected it off him this morning & took it back to Tesco Crewe for a replacement or a refund.I was met with the rudest customer service I have ever seen. Firstly, with a sneer, the customer service assistant told me as it was opened they would not replace it. When I questioned the logic - how would we have known it was damaged without opening it? Another ""customer service"" assistant informed me I could not have the money to buy something else - I told her that I never even suggested buying something else - I wanted a replacement or the money back to buy it elsewhere. Then a male ""customer service"" assistant leaned in to ask if everything was alright sir? with a suggestion of calm down or security people will come - I am 57 & in a suit! (check your cctv Tesco 11.40 this morning) I was questioning the ludicrous decision, surely we are allowed to ask why??? I left the store with the faulty goods, rang my friend to tell him, he rang back 5 minutes later - bought it off Amazon, £4 cheaper, it would be there tomorrow morning & ANY issues with the product would result in an immediate refund. Now that is service. As you lose market share Tesco please dont blame anyone but yourselves.Thus quoth The Raven",0,1

Tesco,Canary Wharf - PATHETIC,"Visited Tesco Canary Wharf at approx 12.50pm.Sauvas the Supervisor + 1 sales assistant I asked sales assistant on how to transfer Clubpoints from my card to mums. He doesn't know. And then I ask the Supervisor who also doesn't know. And he replies it cant be done. I had to offer him a solution - call Head Office Customer Services. Why cant you train your staff Tesco?I will call Customer Services adding to the following behaviour and disgusting attitude of the Supervisor who thought it hilarious I lost my mum in the store!! He was shrieking and mimicking my words ""WHERE'S MY MUM? WHERE'S MY MUM?""Let me shriek to you - You callous insensitive person with disregard and lack of respect for elders and your customers. You are ignorant. And you call yourself a Supervisor? My mum is elderly and frail and dementia sufferer and you couldn't even be bothered to help me find her. You aren't decent..

Tesco,I was in Tesco's Cardigan store last …,"I was in Tesco's Cardigan store last Friday. Whilst grabbing a bite to eat I was left hugely impressed by a particular member of staff that was clearing tables. He was literally jogging back and forth between the kitchen and the cafe area. He was careful to slow as he past customers as he went. For all of the 25 minutes or so that I was there, he just didn't drop the pace at all. I'd employ him in a split second! I went to the customer service area to leave feedback because its just great to see people really putting the effort in. It turns out that his name is Lyn, he's the store cleaner and was helping out because the cafe looked busy. I truly hope that his line manager appreciates how dutiful this guy is!What is a shame is that instead of being able just to leave my feedback with customer services, I have to fill out this online review. I presume the aim there is to improve the overall Tesco ratings instead of being able to simply ask that my appreciation of an individual can be passed on. Sad really. We'll done Lyn, you shine brightly.",0,5
Tesco,They make it very difficult to cancel,"I found that the minimum spend on the Saver Delivery meant that I was buying things I didn’t need so It wasn’t good value for money. I decided to cancel so I clicked through multiple pages repeating ‘yes, I want to cancel’ until a page came up saying ‘your trial has been cancelled.’ I was quite surprised when I was charged again the following month, and found that you have to call their customer services number, which is not a free number, in order to cancel something I was told had already been cancelled. On top of that I had to give my full card details over to receive the refund. Will definitely not be going back to Tesco at all after this. Dodgy tactics and poor customer service!",0,1

Tesco,I have found myself to be disappointed …,"I have found myself to be disappointed with a response from Tesco after making an official complaint. Some people may find this embarrassing to read but I can assure you it did happen and was more embarrassing for me going through the ordeal as a result of a Tesco product. In June this year whilst on holiday in a foreign country I had to attend the local hospital to receive medical treatment as a tampon applicator was lodged in my cervix. I had to pay 150 euros to have this removed. When I returned to the UK I made contact with Tesco to lodge a complaint stating that I had hoped the company would reimburse me for the medical bills, as I believe if it hadn't been for Tesco product I would not have been in this situation. I forwarded all my invoices from the hospital as evidence of costs and events incurred. The initial request via e-mail ""claim to have been through while on holiday"". The works claim sounds as though the were questioning what had happened to me. After numerous letters to and fro I received a final response on 27th October advising that they would not be covering the medical bills as there had been no fault found with the product.While I understand that they have regulations and processes that are required to be followed I felt that this response wasn't satisfactory. I did not make the story up, I provided evidence of the event via paperwork and I thought that Tesco may have at least considered the embarrassment that was endured presenting myself to a hospital to explain such a personal matter in a different language may have been enough to warrant some form of compensation. Instead I was offered £20 voucher as an inconvenience for waiting so for a response from June. I declined this offer as I felt it was an insult to the matter and have since taken this up elsewhere.",0,1

I received a text after the delivery slot has passed that the driver is running late. Upon receipt, 37 items were missing. These items were the reason why I ordered in the first place. I can't fault the driver as delays can happen and he was friendly. However the lack of communication from Tesco and having so many missing items is bad enough to never order from them again.",0,1

Tesco,Tescos positive response to my complaint turned a negative situation into a positive one,"Had a tesco grocery delivery yesterday and the driver was aggressive and threatening towards me just because i asked him not to place the plastic crate on top of my counter top as these crates can scratch laminate worktops .He had a very short fuse and the whole experience was really quite frightening .I dont think tescos should employ people who behave in this way .I have shopped for groceries online for some time and i must admit before this frightening experience all the previous drivers have been very helpful and pleasant.When i told him i would report hi he answered ""do what you like"" so hes obviously not worried that he will be reprimanded in any way.I phoned customer services and was told a manager would ring me today ,no call received.I have emailed Dave Lewis CEO and hope to get a response from him or are tescos too big to care about individual customers experiences?? UPDATE 17/11/2017--------------------------------------------- Following my complaint re this driver to Dave Lewis CEO i am very pleased with the positive response i have received to my complaint.When i made my complaint i wanted to achieve 2 outcomes A i wanted a written apology and B i wanted the assurance that tesco would take action to ensure this driver does not subject any other tesco customers to this type of behaviour in the future Tesco have given me a written apology and have assured me that this driver will receive further on the job training to ensure an incident of this nature does not occur again in the future. I am very happy with this positive response from tesco and this has shown me that tesco are not too big too are about their individual customers.I strongly believe its not that things do sometimes go wrong more important to me is how a company addresses such issues when they arise .How they address such issues shows the measure of a company ,i am completely satisfied with the positive way tesco has addressed my complaint and the result is i will quite happily continue shopping with tesco in the future both online and in store",0,5

Tesco,I have used Tesco for a little while …,"I have used Tesco for a little while now as the Hall Green, Bham store is very close by and I am disabled so can't go far. The last couple of times I have bought yogurts they have been off when I have gone to eat them, even though they are well in date. I can't help but wonder if some of the chilled goods aren't being stored correctly or if they have been left sitting out of the fridge for too long. I no longer can trust them.Another issue I have with my particular Tesco branch is that they are always filling the shelves and fridges when I am shopping. It can be a nightmare when you are trying to get up and down the isles and their trolleys are your way. Sometimes they are left sat unattended in the middle of the aisle and people are forever pushing them out of their way.UPDATE- We are now into May 20118 and I can report that the issue of staff stocking shelves at busy times of the day is still going on. Every aisle you turn into has somebody with a huge metal trolley is in the way of customers or the trolley is pushed up against the section of the food section I need to get to. I now walk with a walking stick and I need space to walk but the big shelf stacking trolleys are making it very hard for me to use the aisles let alone reach the shelves.Tesco, stop this else I will have to start shopping elsewhere soon. I understand you need to stock the shelves but surely you can do this at quieter times, not at times when people who work need to shop. After all, this is a 24 hour store.",0,2

I got money from Royal Mail post office. I then went over to Tesco Express to buy a few items. I handed my £20.00 note to the cashier and without hardly looking at it she instantly shouted ""that's not real"" in front of the queue. I said that I got it from the post office earlier and it must be real. She said that she could just tell it was fake by the feel. I asked her to test it properly and she said no its just not real. I said well I need to take it back to the post office and she held on to it and said she would take it to the back of the shop. She was gone for a few minutes and then said the manager disagreed and said the note was genuine. I was not happy about this and asked for my money back. She accused me of something untrue without even checking the note properly. I have to say I am disgusted by the way I was treated by this woman. Absolutely disgusting. There was no need for it at all. Doesn't even deserve one star.",0,1

There seems to be a lot more staff than customers and those staff huddle (Tesco Hudl?) in the aisles talking away to each other, blocking your way.Ask them anything and it's always ""I'll get someone for you"". They consider themselves managers, you see.Remember to wipe your feet on the way out and get over to Aldi or Lidl to see what a proper store looks like.This is a disgrace.",0,1
Tesco,Dangerous electrical goods diabolical response *BEWARE*,"I purchased a microwave that actually burst into flames after a week melting the glass plate and rollers this was obviously extremely dangerous, when I returned the microwave to my local store their response was that it was something I needed to take up with the manufacturer and not Tesco! That in itself was not acceptable however when I completed the online review voiced ng my dissatisfaction I received an email from Tesco saying many thanks for your review but it did not meet our criteria and will not be published. Pretty shocking and totally unacceptable. I will be making an official complaint to trading standards whilst I await a replacement microwave which I'm not sure that I want anymore.

Tesco,Kippers and Plaice fillets.,"This is not a general review about Tesco, I am dealing with a specific problem that has occurred with two different lots of fish bought on different occasions. Both lots were packaged in plastic and both were well within the sell by date. Unfortunately, both were inedible as they had ""gone off"" and were smelling really bad as only fish can when it is not fresh. They had been bought in a local store and refrigerated within half an hour of purchase. My advice; Tesco may be fine for some groceries but don't buy their plastic packaged fish. The first time it happened I thought it was bad luck but now it has happened again I am not so sure.",0,1
Tesco,Tesco employee damaged my car.

They keep saying that their Head Office would write to me with the outcome of the in-store investigation.Finally Tesco's Head Office did write, but they took the line that in same way the accident had been my fault and refuse to pay.I even talked to their customer services manager who not unsurprisingly supported the version that his staff and the store had told him. He later wrote to me. The letter was full of inaccuracies and illustrates how this company goes out of is way to blame its customers for accidents caused by its employee's.Beware of similar incidents happening to you - Tesco's will not pay!",0,1

Tesco,Tesco and sucralose,"For the good of our ""health"" Tesco have now put sucralose in all their high juice squash, claiming it is a natural product. Sorry, but I don't call chlorinated sugar natural. It apparently can cause diabetes and destroys the natural beneficial bacteria in your gut. I hadn't realised this as they just sneakily put ""improved recipe"" on the bottles. I drink about a litre of high juice squash every day, well diluted. I unknowingly was ingesting this crap for about a month and wondering why I had a raging thirst when I got home every night (mysterious thirst is a symptom of diabetes). Tesco claim this is for the good of our health. I suspect it is because they've got their eye on the forthcoming sugar tax, plus sucralose is probably a great deal cheaper than sugar. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find cordials or squashes that aren't stuffed with these nasty chemicals. Sainsburys still do a reasonable range of squashes sweetened by sugar, but for how long? Always check the ingredients.",0,1
