The TJX Companies,TJ takes no care in how they pack their…,"TJ takes no care in how they pack their online orders. I got a huge box of heavy items and more than half of it was ruined and leaking. Only one or two items had protective bubble wrapping. All thrown in a huge box, no cushioning.Of greatest concern was the fact that there were four very heavy rechargeable batteries in the box. This is most likely what caused a lot of the damaged items. They were labeled, ""Hazardous"" and ""Wash Hands after Handling"". The presence of these hazardous batteries were the deciding factor in my decision to take the return in to the store rather than returning it by Fedex. I went through the invoice and marked the quantity of damaged items, organized them by type and took to the store for return. This was a large order and this was quite a bit of work, but I figured it would simplify things when I went in. Still, the in-store part took well over an hour and the ""coordinator"" was patronizing to the point of being entirely rude.When I told her about the batteries, she attempted to refuse accepting them, saying ""We have no way to dispose of these."" She called a manager over and beckoned to her to have a private conversation in an adjoining cashier bay, behind a dividing wall. As if I were suspect. I went around the barrier and questioned why the conversation needed to be private.The manager told me that that store was getting a new recycling vendor within the next week or so and that they would dispose of these properly. After that exchange, the coordinator dropped her snide and condescending manner.Although I had the invoice, the number was not on it, so I had to either accept a store credit or come back. Also, I had not brought the credit card I had used for the transaction (silly me, I thought that would be in their computer), so I accepted the store credit. I did, however, refuse to show my driver's license. I had a valid receipt. It was not my fault it didn't have the needed info on it. Plus I had to wait a good half hour while the coordinator keyed in all the info because of the lack of the invoice number on the TJonline-printed receipt. Normally, I would've just showed the license. But they were treating me like some kind of bum despite the fact of being greatly inconvenienced by TJ's foul ups. I had counted the items and totaled so that it would be easy to determine if I had received the correct credit. When they came up one item short in their count, the manager was called again. Her count was one item short. To verify my notes made ahead of time (made specifically to avoid this type of issue and time wasting), I counted and found my notation was correct. Another thing I would've just passed over if I had not been treated in such a disdainful manner.After an additional five minutes wasted, their finally conceded that my count was the correct one. Did they say, ""oh, sorry""? Lol.Any time I pointed out their unhappy as-if-I-were-somehow-to-blame demeanor, they kept saying ""Online returns are such a problem"" or something like that. Yes, I understand that. But they ARE on the clock, no? They made it very clear that I was a nuisance.Conclusion: Don't order too many items in one order, don't mix heavy items in one order. Use their return tag to return damaged items. When they say you can return online items to the store, it doesn't mean you'll receive civil treatment if you do that.",0,1
The TJX Companies,Tried to pay with my Tjx card which is…,"Tried to pay with my Tjx card which is in good standing and has $1700 to spend. I went to check out and it got declined, the service rep just stood there as I tried to understand why my card wouldn’t work. I asked her if there was another way to pay without the card and she said no. I went in my app and I see a digital card that says for me to give to a rep at checkout which annoyed me because she had just told me there was no other way? I gave her the digital card and she almost refused to try it until the manager(crystal) came over and entered it in. It still didn’t go through and I asked her what to do and she tells me to call, meanwhile it’s 9:00 at night and I was just standing online for 30 minutes, I have a pregnant wife with me and a 3 year old, and she can’t do it cause it’s not her account she tells me... there’s nothing she can do. This is the worst response a manager can say to a customer who is looking for help and trying to make a purchase. The business SUCKS. Employees are miserable and lazy.

The TJX Companies,On-line Orders/Website,"I placed an order a couple of days ago. I just received an email notification two of my items were cancelled. One of the cancelled items was the main reason why I placed the order in the first place. I purchased additional items in order to save on the shipping charges. I called TJ Maxx's customer service to ask if I can order a sized up on the same item. After the rep asked a few questions, she then tells me my order cannot be modified or cancelled. I can understand if I decided to add an item or exchange this item with a totally different item, but I wanted to adjust my order based on the lack of efficiencies of TJ Maxx. Their website should have been updated immediately the size I wanted was no longer available. I would have ordered the next sized up at that time. Going forward, I will not be making any more on-line purchases with TJ Maxx.",0,1

Also, some really nice home furnishings. My favorite item is a beautiful stained glass lamp that I got for $79. The same lamp was $200+ in regular stores. Pre-Covid I went to the store at least once every couple of months. Their stock turns over fairly quickly, so when you find a deal, buy it right away. I'm so looking forward to being able to do in store shopping soon. My local store is very clean and organized, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I've only had to return one item over the years, and they were very accommodating. I have not tried out their online store, so cannot comment on that aspect.",0,5

The TJX Companies,Terrible Credit Service,"I would like to be clear, that the store and most of the staff here was friendly and helpful. The issue began when my mom was encouraged to open an account, which she did. The associate entered her previous address which she indicated was not correct both before and after it was processed. The sales associate informed her she would be able to call and fix this issue or change the address online....My mom is not tech savvy so she called and after three hours and several transfers she was told that they would mail her the change of address information...but to the WRONG address!I called back with her and was informed that to change her address to the correct address she would have to send a five second video of her holding her driver’s license, and two proofs of address (they used an example of utility bills or bank statements). Seriously?! To open the account they only asked for her driver’s license and social security number, when it comes to changing the address to receive the bill so she can pay it, they want to verify as much as one would have to for a passport. It was just shy of asking for a DNA sample. Five transfers, later, we paid the bill online and closed the account. I asked if we could receive and email for payment confirmation as well as verification for the account closure and you guessed it, “it will be mailed”....to the wrong address 🤦🏻‍♀️ This is ridiculous and unacceptable. A company that is so quick to open an account with little information and virtually no security precautions to protect a person’s identity, but makes it impossible to fix a mistake THEY made on an address so the customer can pay their bill; should re-evaluate their policies immediately. Feel free to shop the deals, but know if you open a credit card with them, you will also be opening a can of problems and aggravation. Happy shopping...",0,1

I showed her the jacket gave her the handful of condemns and asked if they sold used merchandise. She just smirked at me. She told me no one had worn it. Especially as expensive jacket. I felt like I was bothering her. I just thought the store would like to know. She did apologize to me when I turned around to leave.",0,1

No customer service whatsoever. He was racist, cold and just simply didnot want to be helpful. He said it's not their problem, but guess what?

My shopping companion had a blood sugar drop, and we needed to find her some food, the TJ Maxx employees were helpful in stashing our cart and extremely friendly. The greeters and cart wipers at the door made a lasting impression - - - you know when you can tell someone is smiling by their eyes? - - - these are genuinely nice and happy people who you could see made other people smile.As always - I found exactly what I was searching for plus some and am glad to have gotten my christmas presents here!

The TJX Companies,"very disappointed. Wrong item, items cancelled, never received the rest of my order","I am very disappointed in TJ Maxx’s online services. I ordered five items on October 20th and was told it could take up to 10 business days for my package to arrive. A few days after placing my order I received a notification that one of the items I ordered was out of stock and so I was refunded. Approximately 10 days after my order I received a package from TJX containing one item that was not what I ordered. I called customer service and they were able to resolve the issue. Since then I have called twice to check on the status of my other three items that still have not arrived (it is now nearly December 4th). Two weeks ago, during one of my calls, I was told that part of my order had shipped and I should receive it in the next couple business days. I still have nothing from my original order that was placed 45 days ago. I’m very disappointed as I’ve always been a loyal and frequent shopper at TJ Maxx. I plan to call again again tomorrow to see if I can be refunded. If you are looking to buy gifts in time for Christmas, I suggest you consider shopping elsewhere. :(",0,1

It has been over the 10-15 days, and I have received ONE item from my order. None of my other items are even shipped yet. In contacting customer service, their response was that due to health concerns there are delays. I understand that things will be slowed slightly due to the pandemic, but to not even be able to give me a time frame of when I will receive my order is unacceptable. The one item shipped several days ago, and I have heard nothing since that shipment notification. Why am I paying for shipping which isn’t even fulfilled? What is the timeframe of my order? It’s too late to use what it was purchased for. I am hoping that at least it may be here before Thanksgiving. I am a regular shopper at TJ Maxx, and this experience is beyond disappointing.",0,1
The TJX Companies,Ally is amazing at the Marconi TJ MAXX in Sacramento,"I was recently in Sacramento visiting my family and went to TJ MAXX store on Marconi Ave. they were pretty busy that day and it was hard to find help right away but there was one employee that seemed to be helping people all over the store. She must have been management because she was having to help a lot at the cash registers it seemed. I believe that's where she was when we first noticed her. This girl had her hands full that day and when I was in the towel section confused and bewildered with what I really was needing, I was so thankful when she noticed me and asked if I needed some help. She was the nicest girl and during her time with me, another store employee came to her with a problem and I didn't mind and told her to go ahead and she seemed to have all the answers this other employee needed and when finished, apologized to me for the interruption. All I can say is that this girl absolutely takes the cake for being amazing at her job. I just hope that this store knows how lucky they are to have someone like her. I haven't experienced a sales person like that anywhere for a very long time. Her name was Ally and I hope to see you the next time I come into your store, Ally! Thank you, so much!",0,5

I mentioned it nicely to the lady standing right there attending to the hand sanitizer-she looked at it-then just looked ahead-too lazy to fix it. I also noticed the only music you could hear was when you were standing at the registers-nowhere else in the store.

Then we went back to the same location today hoping to return it (thinking that it was returnable for sure, since it's a freaking quality issue).

The TJX Companies,COVID WARNING,"COVID WARNING! I shopped at TJ Maxx in East Windsor, NJ this afternoon. I was in housewares going the right direction according to the arrows at the end of each aisle when a man entered from the opposite direction and stopped next to me. I gently said, ""Excuse me but the aisle is one way."" He firmly said that he was well aware of his position. I said that we were not properly distanced from one another (about 2 feet at most). He repeated that he was aware of where he was. I was stunned and looked at him in surprise. That means that he intended to violate the recommendations. This was my first time to be confronted in a predatory manner about the observance of Covid protocol. I have been in grocery stores and TJX and there are always people who are not aware of the one-way aisles but no one has been pointedly aggressive. While I do not like mentioning this next bit of information, I am going to take the risk. He was a black man and his tone made no mistake that he was acting out or trying to initiate a confrontation. I quickly left and went to checkout where I asked to speak to a manager. I told her of the incident and she said that she could not do anything about this. She is not allowed to make announcements about distancing and the use of the aisles. ""We cannot force people to comply"" were her words. I was stunned. I hear these announcements in other stores. By the way, my handbag with a bright purple ribbon in remembrance of John Lewis was prominently displayed in my cart. This man needs help understanding that his anger is not going to further the work of Black Lives Matter so we cooperate for the good and safety of all. I am upset by this experience with the man and certainly with the lack of management leadership from TJX. On a positive note, I love shopping at TJX stores. I have been a loyal customer since they opened but will have to stay away now until the Covid is not a threat. A TJX store is not a safe retail experience.",0,1

Thinking it could be an error. I placed another order of the same item and bought another handbag in addition, later I decided that I would like to cancel the order for 1 of the handbags because my wife did not like the color. i called customer service after 3 hours of placing the order the representative said we dont cancel orders...what? I asked specifically do you dont cancel orders for handbags, he replied NO we dont cancel orders period. I would have to receive the item and then go return it in the store.

It is voluntary to wear a mask, except when you shop at Costco and I stopped shopping there. T J Max has a line of 50 people not standing 6 feet apart, every time I drive into their parking lot because they are limiting the number of people in their store and I just drive right out. It is over 100 degrees outside. While TJ Max thinks they are protecting people from Covid, they are contributing to people getting a heat stroke. I can go anywhere else and get in just fine. Their policy is useless just because people are huddled close outside waiting to get in, and they are adding to people's health problems by exposing them to extreme heat.",0,1

The TJX Companies,Be aware of their credit card policies!,"If you get their credit card and you pay early, you get penalized. My payment was due on the 28th of the month and I posted a payment on the 4th of the month to almost pay off the balance. I got charged and additional $25 fee plus additional interest. Bad business in my opinion. i called Customer Service and they grudgingly removed the charge then proceeded to lecture me that it is not the correct practice to pay in advance. So my thought is, if I had paid my balance in full before the statement came out then I would've been penalized for paying it off.",0,1

The TJX Companies,Does NOT accommodate plus size females.,"I have gone # times to Marshalls which is part of this group of companies & to be honest: Marshalls is terrible as far as it does NOT accommodate plus size females. I have tried to shop there for few items BUT largest size I have found in female items is x-large. They do NOT even have undergarments in larger sizes. So I prefer shopping @ their competitor Ross. Ross is reasonable & have larger selection of plus size clothing. In a world where so many are dealing with being over weight, why is it Marshalls does NOT accommodate this category of people?",0,1

The TJX Companies,TJ Maxx Credit Card,DO NOT get a TJ Maxx CREDIT Card because they RIP OFF customers. Their card payment window is from the 5th to the 28th if you pay on any other day of the month you will get a late fee and your payment will not go towards the next month's payment. If you set up auto payments for any days of the month between the 28th and the 4th of the next month you will accumulate fees. They do this on purpose to make more money off their cards.,0,1
The TJX Companies,"The ""Great"" TJ Maxx is gone.","When TJ Maxx first came to my city, the store was my favorite. I found ALL of my clothes there. The selections of jeans, T-shirts, and workout gear were fantastic and great quality! I felt like I was getting name brand mall clothing at steeply discounted prices. The store was just great!!!Flash forward about 3 years since the store has been there...... the store and the selections are terrible! The men's section has slowly become a collection of cheap nameless T-shirts, unattractive Under Armour gear, and old jeans. The ""quality' clothing is gone. Now, they are no better than Burlington. I liken my current TJ Maxx shopping experience to my favorite restaurant suddenly taking shortcuts with the meals, changing recipes and changing the menu to cut costs.......the loyal customers can certainly tell the difference.Dr. Dave",0,2

Would have liked this store but now I will not order from them again!,0,1

The TJX Companies,No receipt,"No receipt, no money back if it’s junk. It’s their policy. Their policies accuse you of stealing the item in question, otherwise they would give your money back. You can show them the debit from your account that matches the item being returned and NOPE! It’s their policy! This is why Amazon is going to put this and other stores like them out of business. They will blame Amazon but it all boils down to their “policies” what a shame. The countdown has begun. Kmart, Sears, who’s next? TJ Max= Total Junk to the Max.",0,1

If I am not here I’m usually at Marshall’s. Either way it’s a win!,0,5
The TJX Companies,Good deals!,"I never liked how their website looks so never ordered online. I do go in the store for the discounts in the make-up section and not only! Great prices for stuff on sale. I can't believe someone in their fifties got mad when an associate pointed out they're trying on kids clothes. That's a reason to complain? The levels to which the American customer is entitled is crazy to me. If you cry because you're trying on kids clothes and someone points it out you probably need a therapist!Overall, I always enjoy going into TJ Maxx and I always find good deals.",0,5

I have contacted in all I get is the bank saying she cannot have it back into reapply. So I reapplied and guess what they denied her. It was a plain and simple accident that they will not reinstate her credit card that she only used once. They are unwilling to do anything about it. A simple one number that I pushed accidentally and she even talked to them and I talked to them and they refused to help.,0,1
The TJX Companies,They charge whatever they want on your bank account,"They charged me twice for my online shopping, including items that they were out of stock. They were supposed to charge me as the ship the items, which they did not, they actually charged me the whole amount again! They had overdraft my bank account, their customer service haven’t been helpful at all, none of them have been helpful at all.Basically they emptied my bank account while they “investigate” the issue, meanwhile I have no money left in my account.Said Investigacion would take up to 10days.While I have to suck it up for their poor handling of card charges.Never shopping online with them and I will not recommended to anyone.

Because if this rude employee we will shop elsewhere. Mind you we are both in our fifties, so we know we are not juniors. This is my wife’s side of what happened, “to the lady in the dressing room at TJ Maxx that informed me, “well they are junior size, you know” when I told her I would not be taking the jeans that I tried on in the dressing room.....think before you speak! You made me cry and I will not be back. I know I’m not a junior size, but they looked big and I thought I’d try. Btw they did fit, they were just tight.....like everything else I own.

The TJX Companies,I have found over the past 12 months or…,I have found over the past 12 months or so that the level of service from TJ Maxx has gone down a lot when ordering online. They used to fulfill your order in a couple of days now I find it takes 7 to 10 days before they send it out. Additionally I have lost count of how many times they do not send me the correct quantity of an item. It has happened so many times that I feel like employees in there warehouse are purposely pocketing the goods. I have given this feedback verbally and now online. I hope something changes!,0,1
The TJX Companies,Sneaking Charges on Customer Account,"I just received my bill, there was a charge for a company called credit security. It turns out that credit security is a company which acts like an insurance agency for unpaid balances. This is a very unsavory business practice by TJ Maxx! Buyer beware... while the amount is deminimus, it is still unauthorized. I have spent a good part of my day trying to get this charge removed only to be bounced from agent to agent. My next call will be to cancel my credit card with TJX. Full disclosure people!!",0,1

The TJX Companies,Great shopping experiences (for both quality and price),"I've shopped at TJMaxx companies (including Marshalls and HomeGoods) for years, and have no complaints. It's easy to find cute clothes for work (where I have to dress professionally), the weekend (LOVE that I can find Michael Kors jeans for such low prices!), and my near-daily workouts. Obviously I check everything before I purchase it to make sure it actually fits me and there are no defects, so I can't think of any problems I've ever had with the clothing I've bought from them. The rest of the products I've managed to find on their shelves have all been satisfactory - both in quality and price. And since no two stores are identical, it's great to feel like I might find that ONE top or that ONE decorative figurine in a store I haven't shopped in before. Definitely recommend.",0,5

The TJX Companies,TJ Maxx doesn't stand by the quality of their products.,"I recently purchased a pair of cloth boots for my wife's birthday from the Miami Beach TJ Maxx, and the seam attaching the boot to the sole came apart the 2nd time she wore them! I took them back to my local store for a refund, but the refund was denied by the store manager, the reason being that the boots had been worn! What bothers me about this, is that the seam was obviously defective when I bought it, or it wouldn't have come apart so quickly. I asked about a store credit, but that was also denied. Walmart, Target, and Ross stand by the quality of their products. Why doesn't TJ Maxx? Needless to say, we will not purchase TJ Maxx clothes or footwear in the future.",0,1
The TJX Companies,Good products,"Good products, but some brands (Old Navy, Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers) makes clothes especially for discount, so its best to evaluate the products in store rather than online.

This refund will take 10-14 days for them to process and my bank another 3-5 days to post, on top of the 2 weeks it takes for them to receive the shipment back from me.

Racheal (Assistant Mgr) tried showing me a flip book with their store policy, which does not help after buying from their website. She refused to let me speak with the Store Manager and would not give me the name of their Regional Sales Director. She smiled throughout the ordeal, which was infuriating. TJX companies have an unfair return policy.
