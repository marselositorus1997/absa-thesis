Walgreens,Walgreens is the worst pharmacy I have‚Ä¶,Walgreens is the worst pharmacy I have used. My script was faxed in 7 hours ago. I repeatedly checked their automated system which stated it was being processed. I called the Lorain Ohio store and was told they were swamped and to wait for a text. That was 2 hours ago. Will take my business to another pharmacy after this. Worst customer service ever.,0,1
Walgreens,Dishonored Appointment,"I scheduled a Chickenpox Vaccine for my child today. I registered the appointment online, got the confirmation email with my confirmation code. We showed up ten minutes early as requested. We waited in line. We got to the check in window to be greeted by a young man who was confused by our request to get this vaccine. He seemed to think that we were just walking in. We showed him our confirmation code and were told that we would not be served. They were too busy. Come back in 7 hours and they could help us.",0,1

I was late in picking up a prescriptions I had one extra, It was ok, I am not a drug addict and far away I don't like to take prescriptions or get chemicals in my body I went through quimo, Cancer in remission now, I drop one of the pill in the berber carpet and I could find it, I ask if they could give me a pill one day before they refill it they treat me like a drug addict even the Dr. gave the approval and the Insurance too, they are the worst a horrible experience.",0,1
Walgreens,"Horrible face masks, worse customer service","I purchased disposable face masks at the store at 2010 S. Fry Rd, Katy, TX 77450. I purchased the only brand of face masks that the store had in stock. When I got to my car, I tried one on since they had a different type of ear attachment. I had a hard time getting it around my ear, but more importantly, I immediately was overwhelmed with a very strong chemical smell. I had to remove the mask immediately. I went back inside and returned the box of face masks. However, I feel very strongly that Walgreens should NOT be selling such a poor quality product. If I hadn't thought to try one on then, I would have been left to choose between wearing this horrible, chemical-smelling face mask (probably triggering a migraine) or not wearing one at all, which during this time could be life threatening. When I got home, I tried to submit a ""Product Concerns"" form on Walgreens website. It would not let me submit, saying that I had not entered a ""correct product name"", even though I entered the name on my receipt AND the UPC code. I called 1-800-WALGREENS and was on hold over 25 minutes & still no one answered. I then tried to 'Live Chat"". It let me enter a brief complaint, but I never got a response back. I am so disappointed in Walgreens. Even though I got my money back, I just wanted to ask them to remove these very poor quality products from their shelves because they are potential health hazards, but they did everything they could to block me from even expressing my concerns.",0,1
Walgreens,BAD CHOICE!                                   I recently moved to Elyria and moved my‚Ä¶,"I recently moved to Elyria and moved my pharmacy needs to Walgreens in Elyria. I've used the drive through 4 or 5 times for my monthly refills. I just found out they charged my flex spend card on file Full price for my prescriptions. They did not use my insurance copays. When I confronted them about this $500 mistake, They only refunded 1/2 of their mistakes since January. What a poor sorry excuse for an actual drug store customer service !.I am handicapped and went into the store for vitamins and some other things I found advertised at 50% off. When I checked out they charged full price on all 9, 50%off items. What a sorry place this is. I pulled all my prescriptions from this store never to go back ever again! You should do the same! Go to Discount Drug Mart they are wonderful!!! Drug Mart works for and deserves my business and money!!!",0,1

Walgreens,I‚Äôve been filling my prescriptions at‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve been filling my prescriptions at Walgreens for many years and to say the customer service is nonexistent the past 2 years is being kind. The app is horrible. You think you have submitted a refill only to realize s few days later it never went through. They leave my scripts in the reviewing insurance status for days as well unless I call in and ask about the status which only makes more work for them. It‚Äôs a logistics nightmare.

Walgreens,My local Walgreens is an uncomfortable‚Ä¶,"My local Walgreens in Chatham NY is an uncomfortable place to shop. I liked the Rite Aid that used to be at the location. Then it changed to Walgreens and the whole atmosphere changed too. The staff appear to believe their customers are all potential criminals, even when there is no evidence pointing to this. The first time I went into the Walgreens, I was stalked around the store by some employee or mystery shopper. I was not doing anything out of the ordinary, but when I went to check out with my items, the male clerk glanced at my ATM card multiple times, while obnoxiously looking back at me and repeating my first name over and over. A little security is fine, but it is not pleasant to have someone scowling at you and repeating your name like a creep before you fork over your money to their store. Recently I went back. I was also followed around again inexplicably. And there was a woman behind the counter, who I had never met. She also repeated my name. She went on to ask a personal question which left me perplexed. I don't know her. Sorry, but last time I checked, what I did prior to shopping at Walgreens was not her business? I'm not going back. I feel like they make you go through a US customs checkpoint to buy ten bucks worth of hair products and some water.",0,1

Walgreens,I do business with the Walgreens in‚Ä¶,"I do business with the Walgreens in Anderson,SC at the corner of Whitehall Road and Concord Road.I haven't been a customer for a long time.I shopped at a family owned pharmacy until they sold the business to Walgreens.I wasn't happy about it.Unfortunately, I have to be on alot of meds as I have more than one doctor.At my old pharmacy,they knew my situation and I didn't have to worry about trying to explain anything.They were simply aware of things that might concern me.It has been difficult at Walgreens as there are so many techs and I just don't know them.I never know who I might be speaking to and sometimes one tells me one thing and another might tell me something else.When I go in, it's always so busy that you can't take the time to learn names.My meds are changed often and I simply need help understanding some times.The majority of the time everyone is friendly.However,some do not have the skills to be working with the public.But, yesterday my whole impression of the pharmacy changed,and it turns out being transferred here is going to be a tremendous blessing.One of my problems is my medicines come due at different times and it's just very confusing for me.Yesterday, I called and I just shared that fact.The person that seems God sent was Carter.He told me to give him a little time and he thought he could help me.True to his word,he called back and had fixed the entire situation so I no longer have to stress of either running out of a medicine, or having to ask my husband to drive to pick up medicines many times during the month.Carter certainly did not have to do that.Sometimes I have had a question and it has been abruptly answered,and there are so many people, I never know how to ask for a particular person I know has been kind on the phone to me.That sure changed yesterday!Walgreens is EXTREMELY fortunate to have Carter representing your store.I hope you will share my review with as many people as possible as he deserves the recognition!Before I close, I do need to add Chris to the list of assets to your company.He's always so patient and actually makes conversation instead of just answering and speaking like I am a aggravation.( Which I'm sure I have been,but no more thanks to Carter!)My attitude towards Walgreens yesterday totally changed as I was someone that simply needed help,and that was recognized by this fine man.I can't stop bragging about Walgreens now!Please pass this review on to as many as possible!Thank you.Mary Ann Brown",0,5

Walgreens,Dumb cashier!!!,"Okay..I thought this is just a very simple and easy things to be improved! But maybe Walgreens did not recognize this! I've been shopping at Walgreens for 5 years and did not see any changes or improvement!!! I am so pissed how their cashiers are trained just to do their job: scanning and saying ""do you need a bag?""!!! Okay.. We are the customers and we expect the service! We are not asking for food or morney or excellent services, but the basic one: please be polite, use your brain, and please ace the job as what you get paid for! Here's the thing: I am wearing contacts and everytime shopping at Walgreens I have purchased multiple eye drops; not 1, but 3 or even 5,10 eye drops at a time. They are ON SALES, e.g: $4 off per unit, means if it's $7 now it is just $3,very simple. The cashiers will never KNOW that they have to check the items that are on sales!!! Even when I told them to please double check the price because it is on sale (yello tag) for $4 off!!! And they just ignore it, scan it, and throw it in a bag!? When it first happened to me, the cashier asked me that if I had a picture of the yellow tags saying it is on sale! What are you guys doing??? Don't you have a coupon books and just open it scanning the coupon? Hell no! Second time was when they literally scan 1 bottle out of 6, and I realized the wrong charge when I check the digital receipt at home!!! What are you guys doing? I brought it back to the store and nicely ask to give me a refund, and was so pissed when they ignore what I need help with! I have to wait at the front for their ""manager"", who showed up and said ""your $30 will go back to your card in 5 to 7 days"", then left like nothing happened???! Is it normal? Hello?! Third time is that the cashier opened the coupon book and said ""sorry ma'am I could not find it"", and I actually pointed out for them the page number and at which picture the coupon is! I could not believe they did their job at the bottom line! They are so rush to walk away when there's just you in the line. Doesn't matter it is busy or not, they still don't have time to look for the coupons! I learned that I have to take pictures for the coupon to be ready to check out, also remember the page number where they can find the barcode to scan, and also ask them how many points I have to apply to the check out. Are they really know their job? If it's easy just to scan the item and throw it into the bag ( oh yeah they don't bother put it in the bag for you, when you pay 10cents for the bag!!!) You will have to pack yourself at the register, can't catch them scanning the original prices, and get mad when coming back to ask for a refund with their angry face! Please train them when you hire them! Or let us check out ourselves!!! We don't need such useless cashiers!",0,1
Walgreens,Our Walgreens pharmacy in Camas‚Ä¶,Our Walgreens pharmacy in Camas Washington closes between 1:30 and 2:00 for lunch. Others say that Walgreens doesn't care about their customers and this proves it. Today is Thursday and my prescription was ordered last Monday. This morning they texted me then their robot call around noon to let me know the prescription was ready. I have to drive 15 miles to their store and arrived about 1:30 to find out they were all out to lunch. I had to kill time for a half an hour so that I could get my prescription for $3.65 and complain about their hours. One of pharmacists told me that their lunch break is the only break they get all day and that they get FIRED if they don't take it. After driving 30 miles round trip I'm still angry at the policy. It's insane to be closed at a busy store during regular business hours. They must be getting their MBA's from Harvard to have a stupid policy like this.,0,2
Walgreens,"PLATFORM MALFUNCTION, BASCHBACK MISSING","Dear sirs,On April 21st I made 3 separate orders with the application of the 20% discount code with the save20 code.Yesterday I tried to repeat the purchase by entering the discount code in the appropriate field, however the discount code is no longer applied. There is no error message such as good invalid or expired.I asked other friends for information who regularly buy on walgreens and are able to apply the discount without limits, on any beauty product and on many orders.This is a big shame and I am really angry about a big prestigious platform like walgreens .. You should fix this situation to allow me to use the discount on beauty products. I hope this happens soon.Secondly, on the 3 orders placed on April 21st from the 3 order confirmation email, the cashback recognized for each order was $ 146.17. I can attach the confirmation email if necessary. Once all 3 orders were shipped, only $ 117.93 per order was credited. To be precise, I have not redeemed my balnca rewards for any of the three orders in questionWhy are you making fun of people?And above all why does the platform present malfunctions in applying the discount?I await your immediate response and resolve the problem as soon as possible.",0,1

The lady I spoke with in the store was rude and accused me of being a thief; I‚Äôm the one that got stolen from here.

I almost had to defend myself against that cop and it could have ended up a whole another way really bad for me if it wasn't for a woman in the background when I came away from the register asking for a pin to write the number down so I can call and get it cleared up because I knew I never saw them from any store in Manhattan let alone Duane Reade. I have so many receipts and coupons from Duane Reade that makes no sense the other day I had to actually go spend more money somewhere else when I had rewards because I did not want to stop put into the Walgreens because they hurt me that bad I have the video and all my reciepts. and I'm also very respectful to everyone in there when I go in I've even had a compliments from the manager of the store manager so I know he didn't know what was going on but I've been by there every day to talk to him.,0,1

I had to tell her I was ready to check out? I was the only one in line? She than laid her cellphone down so all could see she was in the middle of playing a game? Must be nice that Walgreens pays employees to play on their phones and collect a paycheck? Then I placed an online order for a disabled relative across the country to be delivered to their home. I placed the order on 4/2 and got FedEx confirmation of delivery on 4/12 that it was delivered. Only to get an email on 4/13 (today) from Walgreens stating I had been given a full refund for my order of 11 days ago???? I called Walgreens customer service to be informed that my original order was damaged and returned to Walgreens. Instead of Walgreens expediting a replacement order they just issue a refund? I spoke to the escalation dept. only to be informed that the escalation dept. no longer offers expedited shipping even for their errors. I already waited 11 days, now if I re-order it will take a minimum of another 5 days. That is a total of 16 days for laundry detergent, dish detergent and body wash? I was ordering from Walgreens only because they always ship items to this relative without incident. But after all the business I have given them they made no effort to help me get this quickly to my relative who is bedridden. I in turn placed an order online with Target same day delivery and will have it delivered to my relative tonight!!! Giving one star is a stretch for this review!

I got to point of one caller ahead of me, them, bam, right at 1 pm, message changes, our staff is now on a 30 min lunch break either stay in hold or call back you have one caller ahead of you. 10ins later the message states the staff is at lunch, I now have over 3 callers ahead of me. How can this be? Walgreens is broke and I am going to change to my small hometown pharmacy instead of this monopoly of a company that could care less about customer satisfaction or quality customer care. You have just lost a very lucrative consistent customer. My money will go to a company that actually works for their customers. Enjoy your stock decline and loss in revenue.",0,1

Walgreens,A lunch break apparently is more important than helping pharmacy customers,"I just had a prescription that was ready to be picked up and my roommate was already out running her errands. She had been sitting in the line for 15 minutes but when she got up to the window the lady didn‚Äôt show her face or an apologetic excuse to her leaving just a cardboard sign that said they were going out to lunch. I have never been to a pharmacy where everyone is gone on a break maybe it‚Äôs just a Walton way Walgreens trend. If you have prescription of any kind that takes a priority in your life and health do not waste your time and money on people who take priorities towards their lunch. Mind you my roommate had told me by the time she got up to the window it was just her and one other car behind her. Anyone else, any other pharmacy would have taken the 15 minutes to clear the line then clear themselves to go. Supposedly the whole pharmacy went on break together because when I had called to speak to a pharmacy manager they were on break too, how unprofessional!",0,1

Walgreens,Bad business practices,"My insurance company couldn‚Äôt be reached so I paid Walgreens $77.00 cash for my prescription, since I was out completely. A few days later my insurance reimbursed them again for the medicine. Yet when I tried to get my money refunded they said it was longer than 24 hours so refused me.I called later but they just put me on hold and made me wait and wait. Then when I finally got hold of them again they said they would call me back and never did. And then I went through the whole ordeal again and they still never called me back. Now the reason they state for not giving me my money back is that it‚Äôs been over 30 days and that it‚Äôs their policy not to. Yet I‚Äôve been trying to get reimbursed since the very first time I went back to the pharmacy after getting the medicine, which was 10 days later. Walgreens has been paid twice yet they‚Äôre still keeping my money. This isn‚Äôt fair, or honest.I‚Äôm a senior citizen and can‚Äôt afford to lose the $77.00 they took from me. It may not be a great amount of money to them but I‚Äôve got lots of medical bills to pay. I‚Äôve called and called and the insurance company even called them and sent them a copy of the receipt showing where they‚Äôd been paid twice but they still refuse to reimburse me. Another thing I‚Äôd like to mention is that I‚Äôve been using Walgreens ‚ÄòReward‚Äô system for over 10 years and have never received so much as a penny back from them and yet I have only $3.00 in credit rewards built up.After 10 years????

My bad I didn‚Äôt ask for the name because I don‚Äôt want to put everybody on the same line. I really feel bad to give that review because I come to that pharmacy for years and that‚Äôs my first bad experience.

Walgreens,"Rude service, gave out the name of another patient and cancelled my Covid appointment before hanging up on me.","I signed on to the Walgreen site to make an appointment for my husband. There were eight appointments available. I tried to make it in his name but since the card is in my name I had to make the appointment for me. I called the store the first thing in the morning and explained. They said it wasn't possible to change it and that he would have to make his own. I explained he couldn't. I asked to speak to a manager. She came on and told me she could not change it. She was quite curt bordering on rude. I asked her not to cancel my appointment. I wanted to call Corporate to see if something could be done. She said she would not cancel my appointment and hung up on me. I called back, this time getting a male employee. He told me my appointment had been cancelled and gave me the name of the man who took my spot. Giving out the name of a customer is in itself a big mistake. When I contacted Corporate they agreed that my appointment should not have been cancelled and I should not have been given the name of another customer. Corporate filed a customer complaint but could do nothing about giving me another appointment. They said had I called them they could have made the change for me. Who calls Corporate first? I was absolutely furious. Why is it not possible for a spouse to make an appointment for their husband or wife. In my case my spouse is not able to do this. I will never do business with Walgreens again and highly suggest you think twice before giving them your business. The store I had the problem with is located at 1100 Collier Blvd N, Marco Island, Fl. Terrible service, rude employees. They seemed as if they could care less about their customers.",0,1

The wait was perhaps 5 minutes even when I was very early for my second appointment and they took me right away. I commend Walgreens for doing a superb job.

I said I would wait and she said she couldn't fill it in 4 minutes? I said I spend a lot of money with them -prescriptions alone in the last 15 months were in excess of $25,000 and this doesn't count all the other things I buy there or my wife's prescriptions or what she buys. I am in my late sixties so these prescriptions will not go down and if anything will continue to increase. Then the disturbed lady at the window came back and said we won't have them in stock until tomorrow? How convenient. I expect good customer service-failed. I expect honest answers- failed.

Walgreens,AVOID SHIP TO STORE - NOTHING BUT HEADACHES,"Walgreen's attempt to allow online ordering has been greatly disappointing based upon my two orders. From my experience I observed complete dysfunction and lack of ability of walgreen s to deal with even simple mail order situations.My first order was 2 day ship to store. However, after a week of waiting and seeing the shipment was not moving I called and cancelled the order which the cust service was able to do.However what I encountered a month later when I tried a ship to store order really showed to me that Walgreens has a very long way to go to support non-pharmacy mail orders.Case in point. My order was a ship to store but the store was out of state. So within minutes of placing the oder I called to cancel the oder. And the cust service rep told me she did not have ability to cancel order and that I would need to call the store to cancel. Very confusing and perplexing as one would think that canceling an order within 30 minutes would be a no brainer.Doubting the accuracty/validity of the first reps response I went to online chat.. and was put in queue position 39 where I waited for 15 minutes.Again I stated I wanted to cancel my order. Was told that orders are processed so fast that the rep could not cancel. Better yet was told to wait to it is shipped to store and that I should then call the store and tell them to return it and then I would get my money back within 30 days or so.Very surprised to find walgreens lack of forthought and preparation for what is a common request... cancelling an order before it ships.Instead Walgreens process is to pick, pay to ship to store, have store pay to ship it back, and pay to have someone process a refund.Walgreens needs to do its homework and provide appropriate and standard mail order type of transactions such as cancel anytime before shipment. i WARN OTHERS TO NOT USE NON-PERSCRIPTION SHIP TO STORE as I feel walgreens is not up to the task.",0,2

Walgreens,Walgreens is run by criminals,"Walgreens is run by criminals - but, then again, all corporations are criminal enterprises, so who else would run it? Just so you guys know, Walgreens is using the pandemic to collect and sell your data (google it - there are articles about it online). Their scam is simple. If you want a vaccination, you have to register for an account which gives them all sorts of personal information. They are then using your account to track your behavior, to aggressively target you with advertisments and, of course, to sell your info. Also, Walgreens has been leaving people across the nation high and dry when it comes to getting that second dose of the coveted COVID-19 vaccine. We're talking unmitigated mismanagement and gross incompetence from the minute they were handed their lucrative government contract. Their online scheduling is a utter joke. You could end up without a second dose appointment, with a second dose that is incorrectly timed for the type of vaccine you received on the first round, or you might have to drive hundreds of miles to find that second dose. One last tidbit, Walgreens lets people shop without wearing a mask.

She looks at it and says, ""This is for a different person..."" Me, ""I know. That's my husband. He's the subscriber on the plan."" She calls another person over to help her figure that out. He says it'll be 20 mins. I wait in a parking space and after waiting, I pull up to the drive-thru again. It's STILL not ready. It'll be another 20 mins. *sigh* I wait again and the third time the pharmacist says their computer keeps ""hanging"" when they try to verify the prescription. I ask them for all of my info back, including the prescription. I take it up the street to CVS who filled it within 20 minutes tops. 2. My insurance plan only uses Walgreens Alliance RX for home delivery so I try them out. The first time I tried to fill a prescription, they told me the insurance wouldn't authorize it. While trying to sort that out, the prescription showed up at my door. Hmmm...okay. A week before I ran out, I requested a refill. First, they told me that I'd exceeded the amount my insurance would allow. How could that be? It took them THREE weeks to fill it because they couldn't understand a simple prescription. It was three weeks of phone calls back and forth to my doctor, the insurance, Walgreens. I had to hold Walgreen's hand every step of the way to get this thing right. And when it was all said and done, I'd run out of my medication and hadn't had it for almost a month. No wonder my labs weren't great. Using this pharmacy has jeopardized my health. 3. I went to their website to see if I was eligible for a COVID vaccine since I have a high-risk disease. I entered my zip code so that they'd have my state's requirements. I was delighted to see that my category was on there! It said I was eligible! I scheduled the appt and got excited. I didn't even mind the fact that I had to drive an hour away to get it as that was the only pharmacy that had an available appt. Today, I left work and got there 15 mins early. They entered all of the information into the system and made me re-enter all the same info on the form. I asked if she needed proof of my disease and she said I didn't as long as I wrote it on the form. Never said one word to me about not being eligible. After ALL that, the pharmacist comes out and tells me that my category isn't eligible yet. I asked why their website allowed me to schedule the appt then. ""Because they can't put every state's requirements into the online scheduler."" Me: ""Then why did it ask for my zip code, first?"" Her: *Crickets* Me: ""Walmart seems to have gotten the hang of state requirements for scheduling appointments, why can't Walgreen's?"" Her: *Crickets* I said some choice words to her and informed her of how much time and gas she has wasted for me. I WILL NEVER USE WALGREENS AGAIN!!!!! They've wasted my time, my money, and endangered my health.",0,1
Walgreens,treated me like a druggy,"I am a diabetic and I normally just go to Kroger and buy a box of pin needles for about $20 without a script. Last night I forgot that I ran out of pin needles for my insulin. Kroger pharmacy had already closed. Kroger recommended that I try Walgreens at Poplar and White Station in Memphis, TN. At first they acted like they didn't sell the pin needles. Then they said they didn't carry the small ones. They wanted to sell me a box of 100 4mm pin needles for $65. I told them too expensive and walked out. I tried another Walgreens at Quince and White station in Memphis. They also acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. They required a script just to by the pin needles - I called my doctor at home she was mad and called in the script. They also overcharged me at $49.

However, after calling my doctor I was told they sent my renewals twice and sent documentation to prove it I then asked if they would send info again to the doctor and they said no and were very rude so I called my doctors office again and they resent info. I then called Walgreen back and asked if I could get refills ASAP because I had not taken my medication for 5 days and needed it ASAP once again, I was not only disrespected I was told they would get to it when they can and I can check the status on the Walgreen‚Äôs app. After about an hour and a half I stopped by and waited 15 mins and was told to come back in 5 and it should be ready (once again was treated very rude).

He is 85 years old, and does not read well. The pharmacist did not consult him about speaking to his doctor to see if an OTC option would be more affordable. After all, it was known to the pharmacy that he was temporarily not covered by Medicare as they are who informed him. I called and spoke with the pharmacist (or whoever answered the phone) and asked why he wasn't consulted about it and was told ""We just fill the prescription. That's what his doctor ordered and the patient will have to talk to his doctor about that."" Seriously? I could understand if it was something that was only available as a prescription.

Walgreens,The Walgreens 5511 Dunwoody Road‚Ä¶,The Walgreens 5511 Dunwoody Road berated me and put me in harms way. The pharmacy tech Patrick became verbally abusive and threatened violence. The Pharmacist Stacy allowed this unprofessional behavior to take place in his pharmacy at Walgreens. He put the patient in harms way. The Pharmacist denied patient a COVID test which patient was approved to take. The Pharmacy was out of control. Dangerous and unsafe. The district manager Deb was informed but nothing was taken seriously. Walgreens management found this behavior not to be an issue. All words no action. My experience of Walgreens would mandate me never to shop there or give them my business. They should be removed from our neighborhood and pharmacist and pharmacy tech should be delicensed immediately for unprofessional conduct. There are a number of other reviews cropping up on line which state similar accounts of unsafe behavioral issues at that particular Walgreens.

Walgreens,7 days without my meds,"I've used Walgreens for my prescriptions for years. I've been taking my current dosage/medication for several years having them filled monthly. This past month a pharmacist at the Odessa location decided they wasn't happy with it, after being completely out of my medication for a week she decided that the doctor I've been seeing for years and knows my medical history didn't know what i needed as well as she did even though she had never met me and had no idea of my condition. She demanded the doctor change the amount and how i was prescibed my medication before she would fill it. After a week of being put off and given excuses while i had to use my paid time off up because my condition made it impossible to do my job without my medication i had my doctor send my prescription to HEB pharmacy where it was filled and ready to pick up in less than an hour. I will not be using Walgreens again after this, going a week without my medication was a extremely unpleasant and unhealthy experience which seemed not to matter to the pharmacist. I've shared my experience with others and warned if anyone doesn't want to have their medication withheld and have a stranger dictate how their doctor treats and medicates them they need to stay away from Walgreens. Several have already transferred their medications amounting to probably over $2000 monthly to other pharmacies because of my treatment.",0,1

I ran out yesterday and called today to see why it was delayed. I call the same number. It's listed in my phone and show both the call to day and the call I made last week. They at first denied I even called. The supervisor found the record of the call after 15 minutes or so. She said it was screwed up, again, but that that is just tough. The local CVS is rated a one as well so it looks like that would just be trading one problem for another. This is my life and I would like to find a pharmacy that would be concerned with doing their job and taking care of their customers instead of blowing me off ad leaving me holding the empty bag and suffering through it.

Walgreens,Back to USSR or my horror experience‚Ä¶,"Back to USSR or my horror experience with Walgreens COVID19 test. Our family planned to spend a week in Maui. Following Hawaii Safe Travel requirements, we made appointments for PCR COVID19 test 72 hours prior to our scheduled departure from San Jose, California. We chose Mountain View location and after about 30 mins of wait time at the drive-in, we were told that test results should be in time for us to enjoy our vacation. When we had no updates less than 24 hours before our flight to take off and AegiesLab (contractor for PWNHealth, which is a contractor to Walgreens) continued to tell us that 'no sample have been received by the lab', I called PWNHealth hotline. I was told, PWNHealth has no phone number for AegiesLab to get updates and it had no information to share with us. I called Walgreens, and only got to the answering service. Walgreens Customer Service page was periodically down and LiveChat displayed the message suggesting that no agents were available to respond. Nice! We ended up rebooking our flight to a later time, rush to the CarbonHealth location for Rapid PCR COVID test at the cost of $170 per person (cash/credit card only). Less than an hour later we had our results and could leave for our vacation. Our Walgreens COVID19 test results arrived 6 days later!!! There was not a single email or a word of apology. If we stayed and waited for our Walgreens COVID test results, we would have lost our vacation (it would have been a complete nightmare of 'wait and worry') and over $4,000 in travel reservations. I am sure Walgreens would respond back to this review (if they even bother to do so) to suggest that it was not their fault, but the ball got dropped somewhere by AegiesLab or PWNHealth. Sorry, but I don't take this rubbish. Even if you outsource the delivery of the service, you are responsible for its quality. Never again I am going to entrust Walgreens for anything related to our health or our plans. I got the service I was not used to since we left USSR for the US 25 years ago.",0,1

Ok, the new system is having some problems communicating with the old system, However how can these people not be trained to know how to navigate their own app and understand their product?? So the cashier tells my boyfriend his coupon is not showing. She gets the same manager from the day before. He had the nerve to ask my boyfriend had he not already used the coupon. My boyfriend explained, different person different acct. So he tells my boyfriend there‚Äôs nothing he can do. So then suggests he uses his rewards and leaves. The cashier tells him that the system wasn‚Äôt applying the rewards. Same story as the day before with me. He tries to show her his phone and she turned her face the other way and ignores him. My boyfriend paid and left all upset. How can a company be so horrid that the their customers service is non existent? Fast forward to filing a complaint with their customer service department and he gets a follow up call from the store manager (Roy). Basically he apologized and made excuses for Sylvia (the cashier) saying she‚Äôs ‚Äúold‚Äù... I am just lost for words. And that is why we and my family will be taking our business elsewhere. And I will make sure my friends do as well. People working in customer service not giving any customer service. They just want to charge you and that‚Äôs it. With the attitude that you are bothering them. How do they get hired? But then again if the manager is no better then that‚Äôs that on that. I often wonder if the regional managers are are careless and as bad or they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening at their stores? But how can they not know when the abundance of complaints and the reviews speak for themselves? So I guess that answers the question, I rather pay more and get good customer service than to be treated like that. Useless surveys they do nothing with. I will be writing to Consumers affairs.",0,1

Walgreens,Too pristine,"Petrichor: the way thine Earth smells; so Earthy and exquisite. That was the way thine Walgreens in Minneapolis smelled when I entered, making my nostrils pleased, When I ran my gaze upon the store, I took in the sumptuous d√©cor, filling me angst. Usually, I am aesthete, but the floors nadir were so fine, so clean and pristine, that my eyes watered on sight. It was so... miraculous. I considered that perhaps I was suffering from lassitude, but upon further inspection of the store, I saw that there was no gossamer, every surface shined. It was certainly not what I was expecting when I had exited my bungalow at the aurora. I stepped further into the building, and I had a scintilla of hope that perhaps... perhaps there was a speck of dirt somewhere, as the cleanliness of the building was impossible to inure. The shop was too mellifluous, too... beautiful. It filled me with euphoria... and I despised it. One may think this was an act of serendipity in the world, that I should be ecstatic, but no. I didn't want to cherish the elegance of Walgreen. Furthermore, I am quite demure, but this shop made me want to brew an elixir of filth and spill it onto the tiles to let it rot for the rest of eternity. That would put me into a true state of felicity. Walgreens had put me into a state of languor on this day, it had sucked out all of the love for Walgreens I once had inside me. I wanted to go back to my bungalow, to my place of solitude. Then, I had an epiphany. I had to remember this Walgreens was quintessential, it held a plethora of goods, it was too perfect. So I should go past the sequoia outside and visit its nemesis, CVS, rather than the Walgreens I was standing in, full of lithe and bodacious women. In CVS, I would be able to find tranquility, and get the same emotions I am filled with when I preview renaissance paintings. An employee at Walgreens asked if I needed help, and his voice was bustling with eloquence, but I would not give in to temptation. I wanted peace. So I responded by singing a sweet lullaby about a wonderous paradox. He had brought out their young manager, who was so effervescent, but when I saw him I just knew he was full of opulence. His eyes were ethereal, however, and that's when I knew that Walgreens was a trap. Their manager was so sanguine, and I was seething with anger. It's an axiom that Walgreens is meant to be dirty and poorly developed, and that is precisely what I told them. I lunged out of Walgreens, searching for a panacea, glaring at the dancing silhouettes behind the glass entrance that was then behind me. I considered keeping my feelings surreptitious, but I ultimately decided, that I must voice my concerns. I am not an ingenue, but the acting from the employees and the manager was anything but dulcet. On my tryst that evening, I told my husband that, though I wanted to be full of ebullience, I could not, because Walgreens had shattered my longing soul that morning. Thank you, and I hate you, Walmart.",0,1

Walgreens,Racially Profiled and Discriminated Against,"Dear Fellow Consumer,I am writing to apprise you of an undesirable situation occurring at Walgreens #3239, 1 S.E. Third Avenue in Miami at approximately 7 p.m. the evening of January 3rd, 2021, which poignantly contradicts the denunciation of ‚Äúhatred, racism, stereotyping, and bigotry in any form‚Äù issued by Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina on May 31, 2020. This particular malfeasance occurred exactly three years and three days to the date of the last time I entered this location or patronized any Walgreens, due to a 2018 encounter detailed subsequent to this electronic mail. Nonetheless, please know that posterior to that instance of discriminatory harassment and racial profiling, I was exhorted by several managerial and executive parties within this establishment to give this chain ‚Äòanother try‚Äô. After three years, one ongoing global public health crisis, countless lives lost, a purported shortage on shoelaces at what appears to be a national level, and domestic and international turmoil related to matters of race, law enforcement, and social justice, these factors converged for me to do just that‚Äîwith a striking, and ominous, similitude of results meriting unbounded ignominy. When I entered the foregoing Walgreens location on January 3rd there were two employees at the register close to the entrance‚Äîone an older woman whose hair appeared to be died blonde, and another who was younger with dark hair. Both of these women appeared to be Hispanic or Latina. They were ringing up customers during my ingress; each eyed me and offered no greeting, welcome, or any other acknowledgement of my presence. I ambled the length of the store and perused perhaps two aisles prior to finding items pertaining to shoes. As I discerned this section, I heard a sound close enough to catch my attention, despite the music I was listening to (‚ÄúA Prayer for Everybody‚Äù, ironically enough) in my portable player. To my considerable disconcertment, the darker haired woman had suddenly appeared perhaps two feet from my right leg and was feverishly taking items off the lower part of the rack and replacing them, seemingly at random. This occurrence was startling enough to enthrall me for perhaps 15 seconds, during which time she rifled through these products at a rapid velocity. Despite her propinquity, which was close enough to touch me, this employee remained reticent, as though ignoring me. I found the abruptness of her appearance, the expedience of her actions, and taciturn nature more than a little unsettling and antipodal to a normative shopping experience‚Äîas well as eerily similar to my previous visit to this store when, without provocation, I was followed around it. Consequently, I engaged her by remarking ‚Äúfancy meeting you here,‚Äù and bantered with her about her vocation.Perhaps a minute passed in this way until, as I anticipated, as soon as I left that aisle, she did too. Whatever task she had contrived in order to monitor me evidently wasn‚Äôt as worthwhile as ensuring that I, while in the store, remained in her purview. She moved to the end of the aisle and watched me leave as she spoke into a mobile communication device; I conjectured her conversation pertained to my location in this establishment. I headed up an aisle towards the egress, disturbed that I wasn‚Äôt deigned worthy of talking to or assisting yet warranted, purely based on my arrival, exceedingly close scrutiny and pursuit wherever I happened to be in these quarters.She walked up a different aisle to the front of the store, at which point I turned around and walked up the aisle she did. When I reached the front she was ringing up a customer and the blonde woman was clutching a mobile communication device while she was about to traverse the aisle I was originally walking up‚Äîuntil she saw me come up another aisle, then no longer went anywhere. My pursuers, it seemed, had shifted, but the pursuance persisted. It was obvious I was the sole target of these employee‚Äôs attention and was considered polemical or a threat requiring excessively close trailing and supervision‚Äîyet not greeted, assisted, or acknowledged as all customers should be, especially since there were no more than five consumers in the store at this juncture. It was disenchanting, choler-inducing, and saddening that after being urged by the powers that be to give both this chain and this specific location another opportunity and, having few other expedients to find shoelaces (which this store didn‚Äôt contain), my experience paralleled my previous one, resulting in a personal reaffirmation to no longer patronize Walgreens.Sincerely, Mr. Harassed.",1,1

Both the pharmacy and checkers in the front erroneously pretend to not know what they're doing and take your information and then tell you that you can't purchase items on OTC when they're displays show OTC accepted for those items. Twice in last 2 months I've been charged for items that I didn't purchase after a cheker pretends to not know what they're doing and say they don't accept OTC for certain items that are OTC accepted. They delay at checkout and then get your info. And whether you purchase anything or not you will get a receipt by email for a scarf or some other item that you didn't purchase. Watch out. They skam and if you don't know what that means it means that they will double charge you and / or charge you for items that you don't get and refund it through customer service to a Visa credit card you don't even have likely so they can use you as cover to steal.,0,1
Walgreens,Walgreens is very unprofessional,Walgreens has in the past 2 years made regular mistakes in counting meds & refilling meds. They have made a 40 pill mistake one month.

Walgreens,Poor care of OTC approved items,"I want Wal-greens to start standing behind the products that are labeled as ""OTC approved"". When I get to the register, I do not want the Wal-greens employee to tell me that my item is not ""OTC aporoved"", only for me to show her that it is ""OTC approved"", but for her to tell me that she can't do anything about it. You won't stand behind your OTC approved products, Wal-greens? Even your store managers say that they can't fix the problem if an item is OTC approved, but not in the computer. I'm sick of getting to the counter and items not getting paid for, and I'm also sick of employees and managers who don't care. Walgreens really needs to get it together!",0,1

The person at the Walgreens pharmacy at the cathedral city Walgreens off of Dinah shore and date Palm were very inconsiderate because they kept hanging up on me. Very rude! Not happy with this store. Will have to go elsewhere from now on. Very disappointing. Someone needs to speak to the technician that was working this day and time and inform him/her that he/she can‚Äôt waste people‚Äôs time like that and hang up on them.

The shopping portion search engine is unpredictable; it will find an item, and fail to recognize the identical search parameters the next time you shop. It also fails to place items in the shopping cart after indicating that the selection was successful.The checkout process is a nightmare. It took 8 attempts to place an order. Each of these steps had to be repeated numerous times, with varying degrees of success. In the past I have needed to call Customer Service to process frozen online orders. The biggest problem is the app does not permit items to be removed from the shopping cart. My credit card entry was kicked back until I set up an autopay account. If you select auto pay, it skips the ship-to-store option. It's great to have access to products that are only offered online, but the app really needs a lot of work.",0,1

Walgreens,Very Disappointed,"I had been a customer at the Rite Aid in Barrington,RI for years and they were great. Walgreens purchased Rite Aid and closed that store for no reason I could see since there was no Walgreens in the town. Just another example of corporate greed and stupidity. I moved the prescriptions to Walgreens in Tiverton,RI since then it has been one screw up after another. The pharmacy staff constantly messes everything up. None of them seem to know what they are doing. One example is that I had one prescription that had been 45 pills for years suddenly it changed to 38. Either they messed up or the script was sent wrong. Either way rather then check they filled it that way. I ran out of pills and couldn‚Äôt understand why. I than looked at the bottle and realized the problem. This was the last straw. I finally got so fed up I mores all my prescriptions to CVS. Very disappointing.

Walgreens,Some Extremely Rude Employees,"On Dec. 29, 2020 I went to the Walgreens at the corner of Coors and Sequoia in Albuquerque, NM to pick up some pictures I had printed. The man behind the photo counter asked my name and what size pictures they were. I told him my name and what sizes I thought they were. Then I told him I had an email saying they were ready. He jumped all over me, telling me to stop being impatient, that an email would not help him. Then he told me they did not have my pictures.I looked at my email and he ked that I was in the correct store. He said I was, but that the pictures weren‚Äôt there. I kept trying to give him information that would help him but he didn‚Äôt want to hear it. He was so rude, I started handing it right back to him.Another employee came, looked at my email and found my pictures. I tried to tell them that if the guy had not been rude and refused to listen, he could have found them. But he, she, then the store mgr jumped in and told me I was rude. At that point I definitely was.Why would Walgreens employ a man who cannot think outside his little box, who tells people he doesn‚Äôt want help, who refuses to look at anything people offer him that has information he needs? Then insists the pictures aren‚Äôt there, when in fact they are? Then they defend the man, not even knowing how he talked to me and treated me, since they came into the situation late.And this is a week after Sonja in the pharmacy refused to spend 15 seconds to look and see why my Rx cost more than it had every month before. She was rude and refused to look, telling me I had to call my ins. co. I went home, called the pharmacy mgr and got it worked out, paying what I normally pay, but Sonja was horrible. Another employee at this Walgreens who should be fired.There are some great, helpful, friendly people at this store. But now that I know the mgr backs the rude, unhelpful ones, I will change stores. There is no excuse for this kind of behavior from employees.",0,1

Walgreens,This is about Walgreens corporate‚Ä¶,"This is about Walgreens corporate decisions/policy. Late night we have to drive 29 to 43 miles to get a covered prescription with our TRICARE insurance that requires us to use WALGREENS. If we could get our script covered at CVS we wouldn't have that far to go for a 24 hour pharmacy. Sometimes in an emergency we need a script at night or may have a question regarding our meds at night. But there are not any WALGREENS 24 hour Pharmacy Departments open in South Pinellas county. They tell us we have to travel to another county, 30 to 43 miles to a Walgreens 24 Pharmacy Department. This is crazy and isn't just due to COVID-19, it has been going on for at least a couple years now. We have TRICARE and they used to use CVS but for a few years now they make us use Walgreens for non mail order prescriptions in order to have it covered. Using a pharmacy that doesn't have one 24 hour pharmacy department open in our county area is poor judgement and poor customer service. They shouldn't have us drive so far to get a needed script under Tricare. We are senior citizens on a limited income so need it covered, but even young sick people shouldn't have to do this either! I hope both companies see this and make better decisions.",0,3

Walgreens,My doctor called in a prescription to‚Ä¶,My doctor called in a prescription to the Walgreens in Idaho falls on 17th Street and Holmes on Monday morning. Tuesday at 11 40 a.m. I went to the drive-in window and there was a sign up saying the Pharmacy was closed. We then went inside and the lady told us that there was no pharmacist available due to illness. She was very short with us.I had my doctor call in prescription to Pharmacy in Ammon. We waited in line 1 hour and 30 minutes to get to the window. When we pulled up to the window the pharmacist told us the prescription wasn't filled yet and we waited another 15 minute. Why didn't the pharmacy on 17th Street and Holmes call a pharmacist in from another Walgreens in Idaho Falls to fill the vacancy? Walgreens did not tell us any alternatives or provide any recommendations on what to do. I also think management dropped the ball! I am seriously considering changing Pharmacies!!!,0,1
Walgreens,False Advertising,"Walgreens is falsely advertising order online and pick up in 30 minutes. I'm writing this to hopefully save other consumers the headache I experienced. I placed an order online and headed to the store 4 hours later since they advertised 30 minute pickup or less. The store had no proof of my order and I spoke to 3 different employees who would not deliver my product even though my card had been charged. I spent an additional 40 minutes on hold when I contacted Walgreens via phone to cancel my order. The Walgreens representative then told me I needed to contact the store directly (the same store that didn't have proof of my order) to cancel my order!?! All in all, I wasted over 90 minutes of my time and will not spend any of my hard earned money at Walgreens ever again.",0,1

I am still waiting onan order placed yesterday and neither corporate or the store can help me they are to busy transfering me to each other. Finally after waiting in the pick up line on the phone and parked over 65 minutes I decided to go into the store in pajamas after being notified of covid positive results. It took 25 minutes to gather my items with zero support on finding a number of items. Went to register and my items added up to a total $65.00 greater than my online price and the manager said they could mach the online prices even though i had a receipt of my order with me. I was asked to leave due to store closing and still have not gotten my medicines needed. corporate was then the mosty painful of the experience. Walgreens sucks!",0,1
Walgreens,I can see why Walgreens has a 77% rate‚Ä¶,"I can see why Walgreens has a 77% rate of bad. My wife needed a prescription filled to stop her heavy bleeding. She needed to take it for 3 to 4 days before returning to the doctor for a set appointment. The prescription was sent out by the doctors office to Walgreens in Zebulon, N.C. on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. My wife called 3 time on that Wednesday and everyday after that with them not being able to find the prescription. On Monday after talking to her doctor, they verified it had been sent to Walgreens. But every time she has called in to Walgreens no one in the pharmacy could find any record of it. Even Monday morning before calling the doctor there was not record. After the nurse called the pharmacy to verify it was there after talking to the pharmacist, they vitrified that they in fact had the prescription. So my wife finally got to talk to the pharmacist and they said they would fill it and to call back in an hour about pick up. No one in the pharmacy could find her prescription for almost six days so she now has to reschedule her doctor appoint for the follow up visit after she takes the prescription. Total incompetence on the staff there. I told my wife to never send any of my prescriptions to this Walgreens in Zebulon.",0,1

Walgreens,...I wanted to share this as a buyer‚Ä¶,"...I wanted to share this as a buyer beware notice..I purchased 2 Vanilla Visa gift cards from Walgreens in Boca the day before Thanksgiving for $340 each plus the $6.95 activation fees. After the cards were opened, there were only 12 numbers instead of the usual 16 and no cvv number. I immediately returned to Walgreens and spoke to their manager Mr. Doyle who said he couldn't do anything about it, and quite frankly was almost acting as if I tampered with the cards instead of immediately exchanging these defective cards. I asked him to try and purchase new cards and would be willing to lose the $6.95 fee, but when he went to swipe the cards, they didn't work. I had purchased them through their pharmacy drive-through, and the girl at the drive-through had stapled the gift receipts to the cards. When Mr. Doyle saw the staple, he asked why it had a staple in each card? I told him to ask his employee who had stapled the gift receipt to it after I purchased them. He refused to give me my money back and proceeded to give me Visa's number. The calls are all routed to Asia and the robotic response from every associate I spoke to was that I have to wait until their research dept reviews my receipt, license, and front and back of the gift cards which they had me email. Even their supervisors did not go off that scripted response. One associate slipped up and knew the amount I had funded them with when I first called, but refused to assure me that I would be getting replacement cards. They know from the identifying numbers on the back of the card that it hadn't been used, but instead of saying...so sorry, we will replace these defective cards asap, they said to expect an answer in 20 days, again not saying anything about a refund or new replacement cards. This incident has been beyond eye opening for me. I am trying to remain positive, but aside from the fact that I had to make right to the people I gave the cards to, it has been embarrassing and maddening. I am beyond frustrated. I do not understand why the Walgreens in Boca will not refund me my money, or give me 2 active cards that actually work. Instead, I was faced with an accusational tone by the manager who did absolutely nothing to assist me. I am putting this on Facebook, yelp and wherever I can because it is the holiday season and I want everyone to be aware of this scam that I believe Walgreens is perpetuating through their lack of assistance in helping me to retrieve my lost money. They should have fought this with Visa as a corporation and refunded me my money or exchanged the cards. They basically took my cash and sold me useless plastic. Buyers beware as many will purchase gift cards at this time of year, and I would hate to see this happen to anybody else. If anyone has any advice, I could really use it right now. I am extremely distraught over this situation as financially it came at a pretty bad time for me to just lose $680.",0,1
Walgreens,Previously at Walgreens here in Las‚Ä¶,"Previously at Walgreens here in Las Vegas, Seniors were offered (every first Tuesday of the month) a 30% discount on Walgreens products and a 20% discount on products other than Walgreens. I also saw this stated online regarding, apparently for all Walgreens around the country. However, I was at the Walgreens on W. Sahara and S. Las Vegas Blvd. last month, and they no longer had the 30% Senior discount for Walgreens goods, just a blanket 20% discount for all goods on the first Tuesday of every month. Being as how Walgreens is always really high-priced, and that discount is just for Seniors ONCE a month, I think it is pretty petty of them to withdraw the 30% discount. When I politely asked one of the staff (herself obviously a Senior), she acted like I must be a crook, not to be trusted. She has been with that Walgreens since 1981 or 1982, according to her badge. You would think that anyone who had been with Walgreens that long would know how to treat customers politely. But such is not the case.Rite Aid, in NYC, is a great drugstore because if you have their frequent customer card, you get a 20% discount every day. I wish Rite Aid would open here in Las Vegas.Thank heaven, we do have WALMART here, so, of course, I shop there most of the time for great prices.",0,3

I was told (November 19th) my test would take anywhere from 1 to 24 hours. As it is the holidays and more people are getting tested, I expected 24 hours. I was later told because an increase in tests, it would be one to two business days. After 3 business days, I was told that Walgreens does not have a COVID lab. I later found out that was a lie. They not even only had a lab, but their lab had no clue about my specimen 4 business days later. I was encouraged not to get retested because my claim was being ‚Äúescalated.‚Äù After a week, I am now at risk of missing a SMALL (5 person) gathering with parents and brothers because they were not able to hold themselves accountable.

Walgreens,Excellent,"23 November 2020 Bedford Texas USA On November 20, 2020 I had to go to Walgreens at the 4121 Harwood Rd branch. be at Bedford Texas. There I was helped by Mr. Ryan Mudon. With my prescribed doctor's prescription. Have pretty nasty physical complaints.With efficiency, very clear language, Mr. Ryan Mundon gave me the prescription drugs. Since I had complaints about it after this, I went back to Mr. Ryan Mundon. Spoken on the phone several times, he is extremely correct, what a customer-friendliness. Don't experience much.His knowledge he has is excellent, but what really appealed to me about him is the Integrity, which unfortunately most people don't have.Money, especially in the money-guzzling pharmaceutical industry now known to everyone in USA, is not everything in life. Despite the fact that it is of course necessary in our very Western society.We are originally a military family from Europe, the Netherlands, the Dutch, have a high business cycle (economy), one of the best healthcare in the world, high work ethics, high decency standards, but Respect is what I have seen and experienced personally Now with Mr. Ryan Mundon.Sometimes the language barrier in this case plays a role in Dutch in a legal and practical way in terms of language, and grammatically even then it is patience, the explanation, ... taking the trouble to provide the information correctly and mention it. See there the patience of Mr. Ryan Mundon.His empathy is of a considerable high level.The word so easy to say:Integrity is not the same for everyone.We have an expression in Dutch:Quote:It doesn't matter how educated, talented, rich or cool you think you are, how you interact with people ultimately says it all.Integrity is everything.Unquote:Immigrants are people, especially people who are willing or allowed to live anywhere in the world for various reasons and who are committed to achieving goals other than in their own country.Given that my /our international and military education (from childhood, background), at the time ended up in business and career within and outside Europe (worldwide), I have dealt with many people in the world and still have been able to work in the business world.Pre-eminently, besides being a very charming man, fantastically stylish, Mr. Ryan Mundon. My respect / appreciation for him. I see not only a colleague who works at a pharmacy, but also an intellectual man with a very high (work) ethics in my opinion.A few keywords from Mr. Ryan Mundon as he happens to me can describe what is so important to be able to work effectively:High (work) ethics, There is morality, empathy, being patient because of any language barrier, very accurate, knowledge of the matter, the effort, explaining the medicines, making an effort for the customer / patient.Along this way, Dear Mr. Ryan Mundon, I sincerely thank you for your very good advice in guiding you for the right medicines.The open, highly communicative guidelines that your pharmacy office enforces, that's how it should be. You are an example to many affiliates here in the US. If I may say without offending anyone.We Dutch are known for being very direct in our language and approaching things, positive or negative. Culture determined.My take on this, reading the above, I would like to emphasize to everyone that I heartily recommend the 4121 Harwood branch in Bedford, TX, USA.Kind regards,Immi & Family",0,5
Walgreens,Very disappointed in Walgreens Pharmacy‚Ä¶,"Very disappointed in Walgreens Pharmacy service!! I received an automated call on Sunday afternoon that said a prescription was ready for pickup. From prior experience, I waited until Monday before I went to pick it up. Upon arrival, I had to wait 20 minutes in line -- there was a long line, so, that's understandable. When I spoke to the Pharmacist, I'm told the prescription won't be ready for about 30 minutes. I told them, I'll pick it up tomorrow. We always get calls that a prescription is ready for pickup, we wait a few hours, then pick it up. Later the same or next day, we receive another call that a prescription is ready for pickup. On numerous occasions, we arrive at the Pharmacy, we're told there's nothing to be picked up -- it's already been picked up!! Don't call customers to tell them their prescription is ready, only to be told it will be ready in about 30 minutes, and when a prescription ""has been picked up"", don't call to say a prescription is ready for pick up. Ironically, as I'm writing this review, the Walgreen Pharmacy calls and said a prescription was ready for pickup -- I just left Walgreens and the prescription is not ready for pickup. When in fact, when I got home, my wife called the Pharmacy and the Pharmacist told my wife on the phone, her prescription won't be ready until tomorrow. I understand things do happen, but this appears to be routine with the Walgreens Pharmacy. The only response we get from the Pharmacist when this happens is -- oh, I'm sorry!! C'mon Walgreens, with today's technology, you can do better than this! When Right Aid was our Pharmacy, this was never an issue. Based on other reviews posted, it seems Walgreens is fully aware that their Pharmacy automated notification system has major issues. I'm not particularly blaming the Pharmacist, it's seems to be an issue with the system they have to use.",0,1

Walgreens,"The Walgreens on Euclid, Bay City","The Walgreens on Euclid, in Bay City MI has some very terrible workers at night. They just made my mother drive back and forth from home to the pharmacy three times because they hire girls who either cannot or will not do their job correctly, particularly since they have no supervision. First the employees couldn't understand my mother's prescription and refused to call the number on the card to clear up their difficulties; my mother called the number when she got home and the insurance people literally said that they couldn't understand what the pharmacy's problem was. Apparently the employees had difficulty finding Mom's prescription, which was very odd because when she called during the day shift, those employees had no trouble assuring her that everything was ready and she could just come pick it up later, as she tried to do, only to be treated terribly. The third time, she was very understandably frustrated by how absolutely and strangely incapable these people were, and the girl smirked, turned around while playing with her hair, and called her a b*ch, something both this girl and the person Mom complained to thought was funny. Really, it makes me hope the prescriptions from this place are correct, since it seemed so much like the night shift were sampling their own product. I also hope that there is some oversight somewhere, since all we can do is try to stick to the day shift, which seems both competent and professional, so there is one place where Walgreens isn't necessarily scraping the bottom of the barrel.",0,1

I consistently order packages online to be shipped to this store using Walgreens Pickup Service and management is very rude. The assistant manager is not customer friendly and always gives me a hard time. They are supposed to scan all of my packages but most of them do not get scanned and my order is stating that it's Ready for Pickup, but the staff at this location informs me that my packages are not there. This is unacceptable and I always have the worst experiences at this location. As a regular customer, it should not be difficult to shop online, just to be harassed by the rude employees that work there. It is very frustrating that almost every time I visit this location, they either have a problem with my orders, or they are not honoring their promotions.",0,1

I'm assuming that this is not the level of service that Walgreens associates are expected to deliver. This is unacceptable! Needless to say, I will never go back to this store again.

He still interrupted me and the store manager came over to ask what was wrong, I explained it all to him and he told the pharmacy manager to refund us.

Walgreens,"Walgreens College Point Worst Customer Service, Expiring Meds","This is review for Walgreens at College Point, NY...I called up to inquire why I was given meds, both 2 inhalers, which were expiring in 6 months. Instead, the pharmacy staff condescendingly explain that I was given enough time to finish my medication. I questioned the explanation because to finish 200 puffs in 16 days every 4 hours is crazy! It was prescribed as needed too. She could't answer then started talking about the pandemic. You think you can explain, twist things and talked like you are talking to a child, almost scoldingly. Then to casually say you can alwAys get another prescription. I paid for those 2 inhalers and I will pay again to get a new prescription. Your staff members were also agitated with my clarifications and then you make it appear that I'm the agitated one and say things like ""we are busy, we have customers waiting"" as rudely explained by Sonia, one of the staff, who tried her best changing the narrative like I don't deserve a proper resolution. Just because their explanation was faulty and I was able to ask intelligent clarifications. Alternative truth is difficult to pull off. Madeline hanged on me prior to that saying, ""let me know what you want do, then hung up! If you are truly genuine in the resolution, you would have waited for me to answer your offer instead of hanging up. A simple apology or a simple offer of genuine help in a respectful tone would have been enough. You gaslight customers and then you twist and manipulate it like the customer is the agitated one. Wow!

I showed her my app as well as I could from The car, and she said I will put it back in a couple of days and I said no I need to talk to somebody.

RUDE, so I left. I have since checked, and she charged my credit card for nearly $60 too!!!! I sent messages on Twitter and I only got automatic replies that they'd call me within a couple of days.

I feel like it is because I am black I didn't get a fair shake, I was put in a disproportionate situation, a matrix for failure, however when I did not fail, what I believe a fail-safe was implemented, when my pharmacy manager started to pick with me from the moment I came into the pharmacy until the moment I left the pharmacy, I was told I was being terminated due to workplace violence when in fact this pharmacy manager who has claimed he was threatened was the one on camera walking briskly over to the area where I was putting back medication which like gave me a heart attack, THIS IS TRULY THE SAME SPIRIT AS THE Treyvon Martin CASE IN THIS SITUATION: An RXM who has been accused and excused of racist behavior and showing partiality on multiple occasions, feels threatened and walks aggresively into my (store manager) personal space as if to cause me bodily harm and he's afraid and I'm separated?

I'd be on the TV news as ""local psycho melts down in public"" if I had to wait any longer! When I went to the store in person the pharmacy tech politely explained that the computer said the drug was out of stock. When I made him actually LOOK FOR IT he found it and filled my prescription.

Walgreens,RACHEL: BUROCRAT SLAYER!,"RACHEL: Burocrat Slayer! I have an ongoing pharmacy customer relationship with Walgreens on MacArthur Boulevard in Springfield IL I want to praise a pharmacist or pharmacist tech who went the extra mile in running interference with Medicare or the insurance company to get my insulin I needed and was receiving ""interference"" from either Medicare or my insurance carrier (United Healthcare). The person was named Rachel who did yeoman service in straightening out the logjam. I was getting delays in getting my insulin (I'm a 43 year long insulin patient) and Rachel went into extra efforts, cut through the red tape nonsense and got insulin for me approved (there had never been a problem before in 43 years). Rachel got results, and I got my insulin. She also advised me on what the bureaucratic powers now wanted to obtain my insulin (those our new bureaucratic nightmares). I'm pursuing that, thanks to Rachel and Walgreens!!!! Matt",0,5

Walgreens,Trustpilot,"Trustpilot? One of the main reasons businesses like pharmacies ( Walgreens, C.V.S, Rite-aid, Asheville Compounding, Ingles , Walmart... ) are irresponsibly disrespectful,unethical and unprofessional is because the town/state allows their cruelty and misconduct! I am a Mom and full-time caregiver. One of my children is profoundly disabled and relies on his medications for controlling seizures and the best quality of life he can have. We have been in Buncombe County N.C for 15 years and normal respectful customer service does not exist. Maybe once a year their is a day of ' PRETEND ' friendly. There are too many incidents I have documented so I'll just mention a couple. C.V.S in Weaverville claimed they didn't have my son's medication but I had been told it was ready. All employees were involved in the human rights violation and even admitted they had been supposedly following orders but wouldn't tell me from who. When my son had a seizure by the pharmacy register/desk and began to bite himself (bleeding) , the same employee that told me she didn't have his medications went to a shelf , shook a bottle of medicine and said , "" oh look I found it "". I reported this to a guy named Andrew at C.V.S. corporate. Nothing was done. Now we are at Walgreens ( 841 Merrimon Ave ) and ofcourse dealing with the same rudeness and unecessary games. We are unfortunately low-income and are in a town/state (N.C.) that not only takes advantage of this and through Housing Authority etc... has caused some of our financial hardship but will then intimidate and harass Mom's like me who stand up for and advocate for my son and our family. I am especially fearmongered or denied simple respect or sometimes services if I try to get the word out about what's happening to people outside of town or the STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.

She told me that the app was wrong. I then called another Walgreens location and they put me on hold to check. They did have some. I then went to the Slaughter location and guess what?!

Walgreens,Lexington Walgreens New Circle location don't go!!!,I shop in Lexington Kentucky at the Walgreens on New Circle it's close to my house and convenient. I've had nothing but bad experiences with this location due to a skinny African American woman in her late forties too early fifties. I walked into the location and was not greeted with a hello but rather asking personal information like how much money I'm getting from my Western Union pick up. The employee had her name tag turned around so no one could see. I was told to speak with this employee from one of her co-workers to ask if they had the money available which is ironic because a store such as Walgreens should be making more than enough to make their customers happy. Every time I walk in there they say they may not have enough money. I think it is unprofessional to have a system like Western Union set up in the Walgreens if they don't have a way to give every customer the money that they have paid Western Union the service fee to receive. This is not the only problem I've had with this location actually a year ago my wife was accused of stealing with my seven-year-old daughter told to empty her pockets and when she did so they found nothing and they didn't even apologize. I will no longer be shopping at this location and advise everyone else to do so as well because you will be disrespected and embarrassed. I'm not sure why Walgreens chooses to represent disrespectful employees such as the older lady that I dealt with. Trust me if you cherish your self respect then you will not go to this location because you will be disrespected and embarrassed and they will not do anything about it when you call!!!,0,1

Walgreens,I placed on online photo order today‚Ä¶,"I placed on online photo order today and went to go pick it up about an hour later when the order status updated as ready for pickup. When I arrived at the store location (30 mins away) I picked some gift bags to with the photos as they were a part of a gift for family members (reprints of photos of my grandmother who passed this week). The clerk was waiting on another employee when I arrived and when she got to me and I gave my name she couldn't find it in the regular bins and the other employee told her to look in the back. The clerk told me there was a copyright issue. At first I thought she had the wrong order but when she opened and looked she said I couldn't have them due to copyright because they were ""professional"" pictures. I said M'am I have printed here a million times and why offer to print photos if you can't PRINT PHOTOS. She stated it was because they were professional. Now I have printed photos for many years with Walgreens, including unprofessional, professional, holiday cards, and stock photos...INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS. She said ""well that's illegal and they could lose their job"". She then stated she would hold them for me until I got the copyright. I said where would I get a copyright on my grandmother's photo that belongs to me that was taken probably over 40 years ago? Her response was,""well..."" So I left the photos and other items I had picked up and left the store. I attempted to call to speak with a manager -no one answered at the store, likely due to the long line that was forming as I left because they apparently only had one cashier in the entire store and the one who waited on me in Photo was trying to make her way to the front to wait on the line. I then called your 800# and after holding for about 10 mins someone picked up and said complaints had to go to another department and then after 3 mins of holding on that line the music ended and the line disconnected about 30 seconds after that. I cannot believe Walgreens is that concerned about professional photos when people print holiday cards every year. If that's the case there should be a lot of people out of work at all the Walgreens I have dealt with including the one who waited on me today who has printed stock photos for me for a work project. I remembered after I thought about it her questioning those and I explained they were stock photos-online and free to use without credit via a website called Unsplash where I get most of my stock photos from. And what documentation would someone provide. I offer photography via my freelance business so does that mean that every photo I take is ""professional""? Everyone who purchased their photos from me has the right to reprint them a million times if they want. Every professional photo I myself have ever took I paid for and own those photos so I am not sure where the copyright comes in or how retail workers derive something is professional or taken in your basement or backyard if there is not mark on it saying so.I even asked her why did I get a status of ""ready for pickup"" instead of ""there is a copyright issue"" so I would not have come all the way there just to find that out. She just said she really didn't know. If you have a policy that is fine- every business does. But don't penalize me because it's not enforced and pick and chose when to enforce it. You are my go to drugstore and photo place but I was very disappointed with Walgreens today.",0,5

Walgreens,So I bought a nail remover and a wax‚Ä¶,"So I bought a nail remover and a wax strips from walgreens on thursdqy morning in orange 07050.I returned the wax strips since my mum needed a shaving cream instead.I returned it as usual with the receipt in addition but the rude manager told me the receipt doesn't match with the item so she can't give me the refund.So I asked her if she can check from their camera on thursday morning If I never came here to buy these items and she just walked away after standing upright for 45min just to wait for her snobbish attitude.So I left the product with the receipt to her to sell it and keep the money.It takes a simple low tone and good customer service to have calmed me down so I leave with the mistake from your agent who entered the wrong itemWhat's the use of your camera at your front desk, is it not to rectify mistakes and not only for criminals.Your manager is rude and need to work on her managerial attitude.",0,1
Walgreens,Horrible treatment by Walgreens pharmacist.,"I was treated very very poorly by pharmacist Rina G. I took my pills in because I felt there had been a mistake in my prescription. She refused to even open the bottle and look. I told her the medicine had no effect and she said it must be me not reacting to it properly. She did not even point me in the direction for further help. I felt no care or compassion whatsoever. How can someone like that be a pharmacist?? I will never ever go back to Walgreens for any reason, and will transfer all of my prescriptions somewhere else.",0,1
Walgreens,Wallet size photo a rip-off,Took my camera's memory stick to get a small photo for a metro card (2 x 1.5in). The machine had several sizes to pick from. I picked wallet size 4x4.IT WAS NOT wallet size. I would need a 4x4 wallet to fit the photo-can not cut it down. We talked with the girl at the counter and she said you can purchase a passport photo for $15. What a rip-off. Sounds like such a conscience scam to get people to pay more without their knowing. I need to report to a governmental dept. This is false advertising.,0,2

Walgreens,Walgreens Pharmacy in Youngsville‚Ä¶,Walgreens Pharmacy in Youngsville Louisiana is the Worst pharmacy ever... I scanned my prescription online for a refill and received an automated text saying they were out of the medication. I called back 2 days later and was informed that they did have the medication in stock and that it would be ready after 4 PM. I went to pick up my meds and they tell me that I cannot get them bc my last prescription was a 90 day supply. Now I literally picked up my medication on 5/6/20 and was out on 6/4/20. I explained to them that this is blood pressure medication and I did not receive a 90 day supply and if I did then I wouldn't be out already and that I want proof of this. The pharmacists asked me to come back later after they run the tapes back. They then called back and said maybe they gave me 60 and not 90 and will fill my other 30. Once again I informed them that this is not true and that i would like to see the video as proof. They then told me call later and speak to a supervisor. I then called their corporate office and filed a complaint and since then have not heard from anyone. However. I receive a automated text like a few days later stating that I have a 90 day refill of the same medication for pickup. I called and asked how is my insurance paying for this if they literally fraudulently charged me for a 90 day supply in May and now charging my insurance for another 90 day supply in July. Now I feel like they are stealing medication and this is just sad. It's sad that I filed a complaint and there was no follow up call back. If you make a mistake you apologize and correct it. I do not recommend using this pharmacy.,0,1

I entered my Walgreens customer care info because the clerk said that could be used to verify my purchase because the receipt was long gone. The polish rang up 2.49, not the 9.99 which my customer rewards card clearly showed I paid. The clerk said Walgreens has a 30 day return policy and she would put that on a gift card. I explained I wasn't returning itbecause I no longer wanted it, but that it was defective and did not return earlier in the face of this national crisis.

My dentist office couldn't get through on the phone to place an order so they called me and asked what they should do bc they had tried to call several times. I called myself then my husband tried, both times no answer, must've been technical difficulties so I call the 1-800-walgreens number thinking they could contact them through some other direct line however was met with ""Just keep trying or you'll have to go to the location, that's the same number I have"" ...umm excuse me why would I go there to get someone to answer the phone?! Even if I did, then what?! I'm not a doctor, I can't order the prescription myself, so I need to drive there to tell them to answer their own phone line? Craziness! The customer service rep then without addressing the issue or even apologizing she transfers me in the middle of me asking ""What is the point of your job if not to help customers?"" I then actually hear the automated system for the first time and select pharmacy and a friendly sounding person from the Bixby location answers only to tell me she hasn't had any problems from anyone else and acts as though it's personal problem, I tell her I'd like an alternate way to contact her in case the next call doesn't go through so that my rx could then be ordered, no luck there is only one number, they have no email, online support or any other means of contact if their service line doesn't go through or work properly. This is the problem with big box stores, YOU ARE A NUMBER, THEY DONT GIVE 2 CHITS ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OR QUALITY. If you have an issue, it's just that, YOUR PROBLEM NOT WALGREENS'.

But this time it was different. I never felt so insulted and belittled in my life. I had an incident with a cashier her name was Brooke at this location. I came in to load up my Greendot pre-paid card. I needed to load $800. Before I even went into Walgreens I called the Greendot to see what my limits were and they told me I can deposit up to $3,000 if i wanted to. I deposit $1000 before at another Walgreens they had to ring me up twice so i had to pay their transaction fees. but this location 5011 E Sahara Walgreens on Nellis and Sahara i was un able to. Brooke only allowed me to load $500 I needed to pay my bills with this money and the mere disrespect this lady gave me was so unprofessional and smacking her lips and breathing and mumbling words to her self was intolerable thats why i had to write a review. There was another cashier and he was about to help me about this Brooke girl made a huge ordeal and called management to let me know i was not allowed to load $800 into my Greendot Visa card. So now i asked her in the most respectful way without losing my cool bc i was on the verge of airing her out I simply asked for a refund back and she told me that Walgreens cannot do refunds. That made no sense to me and find it hard to believe a fortune 500 conglomerate is not able to refund my money back. All I wanted is to load my card and i truly hope this Lady get s reprimanded on her childish behaviors and actions. I'll never go to that Walgreens again.

I asked them why they won't read to you what you have told them before sending the complaint and they said it is against their policy. They have a specific policy that states not to read to a customer the complaint that they just made moments before.

Then her obese coworker mentioned how a neighbor filed a complaint because she had a party at her house during covid. They all laughed. I quickly left, knowing that I will never return to Walgreens again in my life. I don't care what your political opinion is anymore than I care to see the body part we associate with ""opinions."" I consider anyone who doesn't follow a doctor's advice a hillbilly who doesn't have the sense to wash their hands after they use the restroom. If they think masks are a joke, I know they aren't washing their hands or disinfecting their homes and I consider them DIRTY. You want complete freedom aka ANARCHY (learn your forms of government red neck) head on back to the hills from where you came. Go cook some possom. But you wanna be down here in the city with us civilized folk, you put your damn mask on or....lose your damn job. I've been in customer service for years. Ironically, I'm usually the coward. I NEVER complain. I just NEVER come back. I never tell you why. I give you NO chance to fix it. DONE. DEAD. This time, you get to hear WHY. I did you a favor...now I expect to see that you have fixed it.Signed,Time to Fire Dirty Hillbilies Who Don't Wear Masks and DEFINITELY don't wash their hands.",0,1

Maybe she saw that I was of a different race and decided not to scan the card (because of the things going around this time). Now I understand why there is a CVS across the street from the Walgreens.

Walgreens,Poor Service from Walgreen's online,"RE: Walgreens Charge of April 28, 2020 for $33.50I am going to try to keep this brief and as best as I can recollect‚Ä¶. On April 11, 2020 I ordered the items from Walgreens online. 2 weeks later I called to ask where the order was and was told they don‚Äôt know when it will ship. Then I got an email telling me it is shipping. I checked the tracking number with FedEx several days later, only to find that FedEx still didn‚Äôt receive it but a shipping label was printed. However, On April 28, Walgreens charged my credit card anyway. I received another email that the order shipped. Checked with FedEx again and it still was not in their possession. Yesterday, I went into a chat session with Walgreens online and was told the order is being processed. This was after I received 2 emails that the order already shipped. I told the rep to cancel the order, and she told me she can‚Äôt do that, but would send some form the right department. I told her if this was not resolved I would protest the credit card charge. She said, okay. It is now May 2‚Ä¶ three weeks from when the items were ordered. FedEx still hasn‚Äôt received anything.

Walgreens,Automated phone service is aggravating‚Ä¶,"Automated phone service is aggravating to say the least. Everyone knows when they are listening to a prerecorded answering system. Everyone!! So stop wasting my time with, ""How can I help You?""or ""Give me a minute while I look that up"" and so on. It is not a live person! You can't personalize with a recording. Stick with the facts without the references to the recorded voice being an actual person on a live phone call. Ex. ""Thank you for calling Walgreens, press one for pharmacy, two for prescription refill"" and so on. When a customer isn't talking to an actual person, don't try to pretend they are. First option after the "" real emergency"" caution, should be to speak to someone in the department they wish to talk to. Just be real please, we all have enough stress these days. If you don't have time to answer the phone, don't aggravate the situation with pre-recorded fake empathy. Computers can't replace the one on one between people.",0,1

Walgreens,Walgreens-St Augustine US1-Awful customer service,"Store @ St Augustine, Fl on Southpark Blv/US1, This is one of many problems we have had.... I picked up my Rx and it should have been for 90pills, I paid for the full 90 and got home which is about a 30min drive one way, come to find that there were only 5 pills in my bottle, but the bottle and the price was for the full 90. SO I called and she said sees what happened and she had the rest there and that I could just take the 5 and come back to get the rest later and it would be no problem I didn't need to bring anything. So today I asked my husband if he would stop and pick up the balance because I had not been able to get back by there, he really didn't want to because his experience with this store has always been bad. And of course when he went there they told him they didn't have it, she already picked up on 4/18/20, they didn't look into it or anything. This is just the most resent time we have had a problem with this store. So he was furious because of all the other times when he called me from the parking lot. I asked if he would please wait while I call and I did and spoke to them and after me explaining the whole thing over again, she said OH I see it set aside and it says customer has already paid(WHY DID'NT YOU LOOK BEFORE??). SO I explained that my husband was not very happy and that he would be coming back in to retrieve it. He did and said that there was no apology or anything. I refill my Rx about every 3 months, they never have the full amount and have even made me wait 30 days to get the balance of Rx in the past and messed up my refills because of it. This was the straw for me. I wanted Walgreens and others to know what kind of customer service, Walgreens provides. I live in between to towns and was told the other in Palatka was just as bad. So I have no choice because I have to get it from somewhere. It really concerns me that people either over worked or incompetent are filling my Rxs. Sincerely disappointed",0,1
Walgreens,Customer service has left the pharmacy services,"Maybe it's the stress of the COVID-19; however, my customer experience and this review predates all of that! Whether at the drive-in window or on the phone the pharmacy techs seem less than enthused about providing customer service, i.e., just being nice to people! It's like they're going through their memorized script and get irritated if you ask questions. Responses are typically matter of fact, ""that's just the way it is."" Once the issue has been explained and agreed upon them it usually requires 2-3 additional phone calls because they failed to follow through as they had initially said they would. They may be on every corner and convenient BUT that comes with a price - higher prices and curt, borderline rude customer service. Bottom line as noted by others, there are other options for Rx service.",0,2

Walgreens,Walgreen's in West Windsor,"The staff in West Windsor, NJ is totally incompetent, inefficient, unhelpful and lacks initiative. I deal with problems from their pharmacy every single month, without fail. I've asked 6 times now to get text messages when my prescriptions are ready, and every time they take my number and input it, make promises, then nothing happens.If I don't call them, they will just sit on my prescription order without filling it for no reason. When I called, a recording told me every day that they're working on the order. 4 days later, I finally got through to them and they told me it will be ready in 20 minutes. Which means they just let the orders sit there rather than filling them. Now when you call, after being on hold for a while, you get connected to some random Walgreen's rep who wastes your time because they're completely in the dark about your situation and anything going on in your pharmacy. They give me incorrect information (""no, your medication is not in stock at your local Walgreen's"" which is untrue), and are totally unhelpful. When they finally say ""I don't know"" for the fifth time, they connect you to the actual pharmacy, where I'm put on hold AGAIN until I have to hang up because the wait is so long. Just connect me in the first place!The people at Walgreen's have been rude, apathetic, unknowledgeable, and they consistently give me misinformation. They refused to fill my full prescription recently despite my doc's script for a month's worth. They've told me that they won't tell me when my meds are ready. That they won't order my meds if they're not currently in stock. That they don't have a clue when it WILL be in stock because they don't know if they'll even order it. There are never any real explanations. Just laziness and incompetence. It's really disappointing and extremely frustrating. They're very consistent in giving extremely poor, inefficient service.",0,1

Walgreens,Walgreens Takes The Money But Doesn't Deliver,"I placed an order via Walgreens.com on April 2nd. The order was to be shipped to my home, and with everything as it is right now, I knew there may be a delay. What I didn't anticipate is that Walgreens would immediately debit my account, but two weeks later I'd still be waiting on my shipment. I waited, and waited, checked and double-checked, but my order never progressed past pending status. Fine, I needed the stuff last week, so I'll just cancel and do business elsewhere. NOPE! There is nowhere to cancel! Fine, I'll call. NOPE! Fine, I'll chat. Ok, great. There's a surprisingly short wait to chat with a CSR who kindly investigates and comes back to tell me that my order is pending. WOW, thanks for the informative update, Walgreens. I decide to cancel my order, but NOPE, it's too late to cancel. Not only is it too late, but they also cannot give me any idea of when my order will ship, can't even speculate, and only say that it could be a very long time. This is awful. I understand things are backed up, but people-- many are homebound--need necessities and depend on stores to actually ship the items once the store take their money. Two weeks with not even a status change is beyond predatory; it should be illegal. I will NEVER shop at Walgreens again. I always thought they were better than that, but they're just another corporation who takes our money then lets us know that, beyond the dollar they get from us, they simply don't care. I have a lot of patience. The two-week shipping time is crazy, but I could understand and deal with it.

As of April 16, 2020, these items are still processing, with no information or estimate as to when they will ship out. The online chat function is a joke, as the CSR just says ""your items are processing and will ship when they are done"" without an explanation as to why in stock items aren't processed quicker than 11 days. The website is a bit clunky as well. I have ordered many, many things from other online stores after April 5 that took only 2-3 days to process and ship within the same week, and I have received everything except for my Walgreen's order. I cannot recommend anyone to shop online for anything at Walgreens at this point.

Walgreens,Rude Cashier,"Dear Mr. Walgreens‚Äô Manager First of all I want to start off by saying that I don‚Äôt normally complain about employees because I have issues with my own employees as a District Manager for a different concept. I visited your location on 45 and Little York Houston Texas and was treated very rude by the cashier Rita. I was trying to purchase $300 of visa gift card for my employees at work and your team member Ms. Rita ‚Äúasked is this cash or debit?‚Äù I told her that I didn‚Äôt know because it was a company card and that I‚Äôve used my card yesterday to purchase some vanilla gift cards at a different Walgreens closest to my job. Rita replied ‚Äúlike I said is this cash or debit ‚Äú. So I told Ms Rita that my company requires me to put in a pin so we can see after the transaction because again I‚Äôve just brought some card yesterday. My transaction was completed and Ms Rita proceeds to bag my items until I mentioned that I had a company‚Äôs credit card. MANAGER!!!!! MANAGER!!!!!!!MANAGER!!!!!She rudely called the young manager over to void my entire transaction . I tried to explain to the manager that it was a company card and I had to use my PIN number in order to get the merchandise. Ms Rita spoke louder and demand for the manager to delete the transaction. The young lady seem as if she had no clue and was pressured by Ms Rita . Management looked as if she didn‚Äôt want to upset obnoxiously cashier so she proceeded on with the void. I told the manager that I used my pin and my money was going to be tied up. Ms Rita called me a liar and said that I didn‚Äôt used a pin and ‚ÄúI should have worried about that before I told her that I used the company card . ‚Äú I tried to explain to the manager what happened but Ms. Rita abruptly yelled ‚Äú NEXT IN LINE‚Äù, while the young manager defusing the issue. I immediately asked for the customer next to me that I‚Äôm practicing social district and she need to be at least 6 feet away from myself. I do not know how your system works with the voided order so I asked the manager for what proof would I have of the $337. to be voided and she said none. So now I‚Äôm supposed to trust that my money is back on my card after 48 hours. No receipt, no evidence or anything. So finally, the manager girl gave me the receipt to help eased all of the confusion Ms Rita had caused. I walked out after being humiliated, disrespected, and called a liar in my face. Don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôve done to be treated in such a hostile matter. But l will definitely make sure that my friends, family, and myself will never return to this location again. Ms. Rita is a bully and I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm not the first to make-complaint on her. I truly understand how hard it is to find quality people but Ms. Rita is causing you to lose sales and transactions. Nevertheless, I still needed some gift cards so I went to the car for my purse to use my personal card . The little manager asked me for a picture ID of my card because she didn‚Äôt want to make Ms Rita MAD. I told the manager that I wasn‚Äôt going back to my car to get my ID and was being racial profile. They never asked for ID to buy gift cards. So she finished my transaction and I paid then left. Just to prove my case on Ms Rita bullying the team . Why would the MANAGER worry about what a team member have to say? I had to ask myself this question was Ms Rita the MANAGER. In retrospect, I was able to go to my normal Walgreens on Park Place / Reivelle ‚Äúhassles free ‚Äú purchased the rest of my gift cards for my team. It‚Äôs a shame that your Walgreens doesn‚Äôt represent the BRAND.....that I once lovedFrom A Unhappy Customer",0,1

Walgreens,How to lose a Loyal customer and a families business.,"So my wife picks up two prescriptions for me on her way home from work a while ago. These are both scripts that I've had for a few months and pick up on a monthly basis. When I need one of the insulin's I open the bag to find it is the wrong prescription (right med, wrong delivery method). I don't have the needles, syringes or training to draw and inject this insulin; nor do I have a scipt for any of the materials since I have never had it before. Since I am leaving for work, my wife says she'll take the wrong medicine back to the store and asks for an exchange to the correct insulin. She is told sorry we can't do that, we'll fill it again and charge you the $500+ again!!! I get home from work Saturday and she explains what's going on, it's already late so I wait until Sunday morning to call pharmacy and try to straighten things out. ... I am lied to, disrespected and insulted to the point where I raised my voice as I was constantly talked over ... please tell me how is it ok to steal from a customer? How is it ok not to verify that a script being filled is correct or what the customer needs? What ever happened to the pharmacy checking with the person picking up the meds that they understood what they were getting and how to use it? Apparently this location doesn't need to be bothered with Customer service, responsibilities or doing the right thing, they'll do what they want, when they want, and charge you double for it. When you try to call for help, they treat you like crap, blame it all on the doctors office, then blame it on the doctors office and you. Not one time ever even coming close to admitting they have a part in the process much less actually having blame ... Well guess what Walgreen's, I DON'T HAVE OVER $500 for another refill ... so I'll just go without my insulin for another day until my doctors office is open on Monday and I can get them to train me on how to use this vial and call in a prescription for the materials to someone else. I am DONE being a Walgreens customer, over 10 years of loyalty is GONE in a single morning. This is far from the 1st time in the past year that mistakes were made, information was not given and we've received poor customer service. Far from the 1st time we've had to ask the Manager to get involved as mistakes were made. But this time for the Manager to continuously talk over me, treat me like a child, speak down in a condescending tone, refuse to answer questions and consistently repeat it's all the Doctor's fault without listening to anything I asked ... I don't care if it is the closest pharmacy to us; it'll be worth it to driving a little further, I am sure that Publix, CVS, Saraland Pharmacy or McConaghy Drugs would all like to have our business each month and not treat us like crap.",0,1

Just so I could do the express check out and come back home. I went to Walgreen on Hikes LN 40218 , there was a line one persone in drive through and one working counter and the Manager came to help. I went to the express check line and showed them my scan, another customer got upset amd said I had to get in back of line. The pharmacy tech stated you have to get in line.

I have used express check for over a year, I have never had this is issue weather its 2 or 3 people working. I felt that I went through everything to get in and out quick for no reason. Also I do have issues when I do use express check out due to a lot of people do not know or understand exactly what this is. I feel a sign being more detailed on what exactly express checkout is should be posted. So that people like myself or other customers do not get called rude or other names I rather not say.

After going through the process of selecting the pictures and submitting all of the information needed, I was advised that the cartridge to print the pictures was not working and that I would receive a phone call and email when the pictures were ready. I am now convinced the person working the photo lab does her job half-assed like most of the other employees at Walgreens. No phone call, no email. I called to get an update (four days later) and was transferred numerous times and finally, after a 10 minute wait hung up. I'm not sure where they get these people but let this be known...

I arrived at the store after 7:15 pm, the 1st customer service stated she didn't see it. She called another employee who came from somewhere else in the store and went behind the counter in the pharmacy. She looked at the computer and in an irritated tone, stated you transferred your meds here there was a problem with the insurance. I asked her if they bothered to call the patient and advise him of this. She walked away and proceeded to answer phone, help drive thru customers and left me at the counter for over 8 minutes. Came back to the window and proceeded to be rude and have disgusting behavior. I asked if I could just have my medication, I didn't want to keep going back and forth with her. She made an ignorant comment stating picking up Norco. I was stunned and flabbergasted by her unacceptable comment, when it clearly shows I was picking up diabetes, HBP, heart meds. She told the pharmacist on duty to help other customers while she proceeded to argue with me. He did what she said and did not step in to rectify the situation and allowed her inappropriate behavior. She finally passed the meds through the window and I walked away and she was still trying to argue. I will take this a step further.

Walgreens,Reviewing Frostburg MD Walgreens,Reviewing Frostburg MD Walgreens. Worst experience I had anywhere. I received 7 texts today saying Dr did not allow refills when I never requested refills. Phone to Walgreens to find out what was going on. Said Dr was sending refill notices one after the other even tho the texts said he would not refill. During the call I asked to have Cozaar refilled since it was due and I had left a rx. Text received saying rx ready. Stopped by to get my rx and found 4 90 day rx that I had filled 2 weeks were ready along with another drug that I had never taken. Said I didn't need those but would take the Cozaar. The Cozaar wasn't filled as there was no rx. I knew there was a rx. Took my rx coverage info as they wanted to be sure that I paid the least amount possible for the meds that I didn't need. I needed to know that my rx would not be wasted on these rx that were filled 2 weeks after the last refill. Tech told me that these rx would hang on the rack until I came back for them in 3 months. More than 20 mins of my life was wasted on this train wreck of an experience. And I don't have the med that I went there to get which means I have to go back. These people cannot be trusted. Long lines of disgusted people. This place is staffed with people that cannot be trusted with the very thing that keep people well. Seriously needs invention!.,0,1

I called my bank's Customer Care line & they contacted TeleCheck & got nothing but a run-around too. Poor treatment for honest people! Perhaps get the instant check withdrawal system or find a new check verification company. Google TeleCheck reviews & there's a huge history of this same injustice.

You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. I will have them refill all my medications and then I will give my business to another pharmacy. Going to this pharmacy is the equivalent to going to the DMV!,0,1
Walgreens,Terrible service and attitude,"So,after months of getting SAME prescription filled at the same Walgreens, last month they were out of it and it took 3 days to receive it. I asked the lady if she could please order enough so that I didn't have to wait this month,and she told me they dont EVER order meds,the company just sends what they think they can sell.WHAT??? Ok,so,yesterday, I tried 2 drop off same script, a day early 2 try and avoid what happened before. The very nice(HAHA) woman informs me she not going to take it because its SO EARLY( ok) . A tried to explain to her what happened last month , that it took 3 days to get it so I would like to drop it off one day early to avoid that and she told me no and that it will probably take 3 days to get it this monthüòÆ. This happened after I waited in line while she spoke on the phone 2 a customer for 10 minutes trying to find him a discount code . I would think you try and help the person standing in FRONT of you before you help the person on the phone- but that's just me. Needless 2 say,I took my script elsewhere and will not b returning to Walgreens anytime soon. I think they're getting a little big in the britches n forgetting us little people who helped them become such a huge company. Customer service seems to b a thing of the past. No wonder Everyone is getting their prescriptions online now,I sure would uf I could.",0,1

Walgreens,Walgreens Has A Serious Discrimination Issue Regarding Pain Medication,"I had my normal monthly prescriptions filled last on 1/4/20 at Crain Highway Glen Burnie Maryland. There is one prescription ‚ÄúLevothyroxine‚Äù that is filled every three months. I picked up all of my monthly prescriptions which includes a narcotic pain medicine. I pick them all up the same day 1/5/20 so I don‚Äôt have to make multiple trips. I received a text stating one prescription was due for refill. Of course the only refill I needed was the Levothyroxine. I received a call of 1/15/20 asking about my pain medication refill. I told the pharmacist Robbie I had already received that refill and that the only refill I was waiting on was my thyroid. She said apparently the guy who rung me up for my 1/5/20 prescriptions somehow didn‚Äôt close out the pain medicine (which I already received), so she said she fixed it and filled my thyroid medicine. I called this morning for my normal refills and was told it was too early to fill my pain medicine because my last prescription was 1/14/20 so they can‚Äôt fill it until 2/14/20. I explained AND REMINDED her of the mix up we spoke on the phone about (same pharmacist Robbie) and she refused to acknowledge it even though I have the documents, date on my bottle when filled (1/4/20) and my bank transaction showing the date I picked up on 1/5/20. She refused to hear any of it and was beyond rude and unprofessional. She remembered CLEARLY our conversation but either didn‚Äôt want to fill it because it‚Äôs a narcotic (that I‚Äôve been getting for years there) or just didn‚Äôt care to look into it. This happens EVERY month with only this prescription out of the 5-6 prescriptions every month. I‚Äôm tired of being treated like a drug abuser when I have legitimate medical issues you can see via x-rays, MRI‚Äôs and CT scans. My entire spine is titanium (half of which is broke and clearly visible on the films), and I live with debilitating pain every single day. I leave my home only to travel to the doctors or the pharmacy. The way this pharmacist treated me was absolutely uncalled for, unprofessional, unethical, non-compassionate and discriminatory. She expects me to go without my pain medication because THEY made an error. If I were abusing the medication I could have stated I never received my medication. I have contacted corporate and the Better Business Bureau. NO ONE should have to endure additional pain and mental anguish due to a pharmacist‚Äôs own error, as well as false assumptions, judgement and discrimination toward a long time patient/customer. It‚Äôs wrong and this pharmacist should be terminated in my opinion. She should not be allowed to work personally with customers. I see Walgreens has taken a severe turn for the worse.",0,1

Walgreens,Mismanaged and terrible customer service.,"I had ordered custom cards from Walgreens twice before and they were great. My issue is not with the product itself but with the staff. Following the initial great experience, I decided to order again at my local Walgreens for another set of prints. I received an email from Walgreens asking me to pick up the order. I get there, and they say that they haven't unpacked the papers yet. They tell me to wait and they may be able to print on another set of papers. They later tell me the printer is not working and ask me to come a day later. The next day, I called to make sure my order was ready. After repeated calls (I was dispatched to the pharmacy and they just hung up when I said I needed to speak to the store), I finally talked to a lady who said that they again didn't have the paper to print and it would take another week. She was at least apologetic about the snafu and directed me to another Walgreens slightly further away from my place. I called them up before putting in another online order. Again after much waiting and repeated calls, I finally got through to the Photo dept of Walgreens where I talked to a man who was very abrupt, but did say that they have enough paper to print my order and I can come by..no issues. I place the order, get the ""ready for pick-up"" mail and call to confirm that it is indeed ready for pick-up. After a 10-minute wait where nobody answers, I decide to go anyway. I reach there and I hunt down an employee to help me at the photo dept and he tries to convince me that the order is placed for pickup the next day. I refused to back down and show him the email that clearly says ready for pickup and he comes up with another excuse. The prints are ready but the card-cutting machine is out-of-order. I tell him I have been behind this for many days, it was pretty time-sensitive and have been taking the Uber each time for these visits. He just shrugged and dismissed my complaints. I get that retail workers are not paid enough and work long hours, but this is just too much! I am only giving an extra star for the woman at the first store who was patient and tried helping the best she could.",0,2

Walgreens,Sad but true,"Sad but true. I have documentation and receipts. I will suggest that if you have had any issues with a pharm tech, do NOT reveal phone # coming Into Walgreens. The system is set to reveal all #s WITH your full name attached. This will NOT show if your phone # is blocksd it will show private. So you will want to put your number as private on all outgoing calls. I have experienced the run around and have documented calls going in both ways. Typically my # showing up, 4-7 mins on hold, and then a hang up. Number blocked set to private 11/2 mins, quick response! I have stood in the store and called to see with mine own eyes. It was not always this way, but then some of the best Customer Service pharmacy tech assoc.'s have left. I will say their are 2 folks behind the counter that remain loyal to giving the best service they can, but that's a hit and miss. I will NOT reveal name etc. I already know the ramifications of how the one person who has control of what you receive can literally make or break a patient. NOTE ADD; I placed refill AGAIN1/31/2020 for 25 pills and received email confirmation for pick up. Someone other than me took to canceling it and request a refill on ER does of 5 pills. From different Dr. I called to make sure the Dr. knew it was not from me and please disregard. So now 2/3/2020 it looks like everything is in limbo and I can not get a copy of notes that Mr.Pharmasist put in my file. HIPPA I truly thought was to benefit the patient. Now that I know Mr. Pharma can view and change my refill requests I will search for a mom&pop place. After 10+ years filling 10-12 meds a month I am beside myself. Clearly what ever deduction, assumptions or profiling going on, makes or breaks a person in need. So SHAME ON WALGREENS!!",0,1

Walgreens,Walgreens in Astoria New York,"My prescription is for a combination of one tablet of 97.5 milligrams plus one tablet of 65 mg of Naturethroid. This dessicataed thyroid is historically measured in grains, an old apothecary unit, which is equivalent to 65 mg. Therefore is much easier to say my prescription was for 1 and 1/2 grain + 1 grain, or, 2 and 1/2 grains daily. My doctor wanted to make it easy for me to take it twice a day, thus he split my daily dose of 2 1/2 grains. When Walgreens opened in my neighborhood replacing Rite Aid, I filled my prescription for one and a half grains on January 4. They gave me only 30 tablets. Taking 2 and 1/2 grains daily, I ran out of my ""30 day supply"" in 18 days. When I came back on January 18, the pharmacist named Yoonmoon told me to come in 30 days from January 4. Having some old supplies worth of a couple of days, I waited but when I ran out, I came back January 23rd, asking for the 1 grain supply which was never filled. I took a special time off from work to be able to be there at 9 am on Thursday morning when they opened. With the store completely empty, they said fine but I have to wait 20 minutes. I asked if this is for counting the pills. There was another pharmacist who rudely dismissed me saying some people called the night before for their prescriptions and it's not my turn. Okay so I said I'll come next day, but I called my doctor's office explaining how two different strengths of the same medication are confusing my pharmacy and so if they could make the prescription just for one combined dosage. Next day evening, back with Yoonmoon, she refused to give me the medication. I said I'm running out and I need to take one tonight so she ordered her associate to count 30 pills. I thought to myself, fine, they'll hold ne for 12 days taking 2 and 1/2 grain daily. But they wanted to charge me a 30 day supply! Again! When I objected, Yoonmoon said out loud: ""Do you want me teach you some math? She came with a piece of paper and showed me a long division of 30 being a dividend and 2.5 being a divisor. Her answer interestingly came as 12 and she'd victoriously circled it. After I said I told you five minutes ago that it was a 12 day supply, she got embarrassed as she was simultaneously making sense out of her answer, which just confirmed my point. Feeling bad about herself, she started being snappy and told me to call the doctor or get the medication elswhere. It was after 8 p.m. Friday. I am now without it for the whole weekend.",0,1

Walgreens,Walgreens In Ridgewood NJ gets an F for their pharmacy.,"Everything that you read on this site from other mistreated customers is TRUE. I‚Äôm taking my prescriptions away from Walgreens after what happened following their conversion from Rite-Aid. Their new pharmacist, Christie, is the rudest, coldest, meanest drugstore employee I have ever met. She refused to spell her name or reveal her last name. I‚Äôm a 71-year-old grandmother who takes pain medication regularly to manage the disabling pain of severe spinal stenosis. She forced my doctor to ascertain again and again that this medication is for pain relief, not for some illegal use. Twice in the last month, she forced me to run very dangerously low on meds before filling the prescriptions as requested by my doctor. Luckily she relented before I‚Äôd have to rush to the ER in withdrawal. How can this sadistic practitioner be allowed to inflict suffering on patients struggling with constant pain? I am sure that I‚Äôm not her only victim. Please, someone who can remedy this unbearable situation, take action and dismiss her. Please. She is sarcastic, cruel, and dangerous to patients who sincerely need respite from chronic pain. Please help.Lilian Cheah, Ridgewood, NJ. 917-699-5984",0,1

Walgreens,Worst experience ever!,"My daughter and I had our Perscriptions sent to Walgreens because my regular pharmacy was closed on Sunday. 1st I went to collect our medicine and the woman said they didn‚Äôt have us in the computer... yet my exhusband got a automated call saying my daughters Perscriptions were ready. 2nd... she didn‚Äôt ask for our insurance information. I volunteered that information when she started to ring me up. Then their system said our insurance denied payment. She told me I WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY. Ummm NO... that‚Äôs their job! I knew my insurance was good so she needed to call not me. My regular pharmacy takes care of those things if and when they arise. I told the woman I would just have my regular pharmacy call the next day to have our Perscriptions transferred. I ended up paying cash for one of my daughters medications because she needed that one right away. On Monday I went to my pharmacy to collect our medications only to find they didn‚Äôt have anything for my daughter. They called Walgreens right in front of me and was told they had nothing on file. I called Walgreens on my own phone and the man that answered saw my Prescription and the one of my daughters that I paid cash for. He also said they have a call into the doctor for a refill. I told him absolutely NOT!!! I didn‚Äôt ask them to do that and she didn‚Äôt need a refill! The woman that helped me (using the term loosely) took the phone from him and stated that on Sunday she had given me my daughters Perscriptions to take with me. That was NOT true... and had I known that was even a option I would have taken mine too!!! She LOST my daughters Perscriptions! So she tried to say I took it and I know I didn‚Äôt. I had to go back to Urgent Care and have our Perscriptions re-sent to my regular pharmacy. I had NO problem with my or my daughters insurance there. I will never not ONLY use their pharmacy but I will never give them a dime from my wallet. Medications are serious. I don‚Äôt trust them. They lose Perscriptions, have terrible customer service and as sick as I was wanted me to call my insurance. The woman said she was going to look for my daughters Prescription in some pile?

Now they have stopped replying to my e-mails all together. Their agents are so rude and dismissive and they have zero knowledge about treating customers or being solution-oriented. I had been a customer for 5 years and now they lost me and my money. You people take people's hard earned money as if it is peanuts. Shame on you. Get your agents some training in how to treat cuatomers, solve grievances, and take responaibility for your lack of professionalism.",0,1

Walgreens,What a joke,What a joke! My Dr. faxed a script to Walgreens on a Wednesday. They called me and said it wouldn't be in stock till Friday and because it was pain medication they couldn't transfer it. So Friday at 3pm I go to pick it up and they literally made me wait in line 20 minutes only to tell me they don't know why the pharmacist told me Friday when it won't be in until Monday. Then they call my doctor and have him fax a new one over to the Ingles of my choice. Only problem is they told the Dr the wrong Ingles and I had to go back to Dr to find out where it was sent. I then had to drive an extra 20 miles out of my way to get it. So after 3 days wait and 3 1/2 hours running around I finally got it. Good thing I just have a torn rotator cuff and not a gun shot wound. PATHETIC!,0,1

So I called the Walgreens help number and spoke with someone and they said that it must have been a glitch and that I should receive it the following Monday. Never heard anything.I checked the tracking status the following Tuesday and it said that it was shipped to Georgia?? (I live in Chandler, AZ). I called the Walgreens help number and they said that they couldn't give me a refund that I would have to dispute it with Paypal Credit (who I bought it through). I called Paypal credit and they said it could take up to 60 days to get a refund.LONG story short.

Day one I was told if there is a problem getting my script filled it is not the responsibility of the pharmacy to reach out to the doctor to get the prescription corrected. The very next morning I called my doctors answering service and explained that my insurance wanted the prescription written a different way. That evening after work I went to Walgreens my Walgreens app stated that both of my prescriptions were ready. Upon arriving I was towed again they were still not correct which if that was the case I should‚Äôve been contacted and I surely should not of been able to read on my wall greens out that my prescription was ready for pick up. The young lady that I spoke to that day I wanted to give me a hard time OK do you anything I asked was may I get a few tablets until we get this resolved? they were two prescriptions for my heart that I are very expensive so I was not on able to I was unable to pay for them by cash. Plus I‚Äôve been hospitalized twice in the last week and a half so these were new medications that I medically needed. They refused to allow me to get a couple until we got it straightened out which it was Thursday evening what time you got a day worth of medication. I was not trying to give them a hard time but the young lady that was waiting on me was going out of her way to give me a hard time like I explained her it‚Äôs not my responsibility do you know how the prescriptions are to be written and they should‚Äôve never been put into the app stating that they were ready because I had been checking on them throughout the day. If there was a message in there in the app if there was still an issue I would‚Äôve had time to get them corrected but instead I was treated terribly still did not receive my medication I don‚Äôt agree with the medical care we get here in the United States but now the The pharmacies are just as greedy and selfish and rude and uncooperative as a pharmaceutical company. I was also called a liar that I never called the pharmacy the night before and that I had called my doctor. Wow very sad how one employee who it doesn‚Äôt effect them personally if I am helped by Walgreens. Two weeks prior before this I went into the pharmacy and there was a young lady that helps me who I will review on because she was so kind and so caring and then two weeks later to turn out to be treated like this by a different employee at the same store unacceptable. I also think it‚Äôs sad that the stores are taking the blood pressure machines are the pharmacy and then we have to fill out forms now we have to wait for the pharmacist to take her blood pressure at their convenience which I understand they are very busy the last thing we need to be stuck doing a stop working to take blood pressure because Walgreens wants to take your blood pressure equipment out of the stores for the customers.

I Said I just want to look at it on the camera you just took and then i can come back later to pick it up.She said i have to wait until one of these booths are empty. It didn't make sense, it would‚Äôve taken 3 seconds, instead of the time she spent minutes arguing with me. Still I waited for the other customers to finish as she went back. Another employee, Brandy, came charging at me and said ‚ÄúYou need to leave now! It wont even be ready for a few hours‚Äù.. ‚Äúoh and by the way your back ground and your scarf is white and you will look like a ghost on it! they would not accept your photo for passport.‚Äù I said: ‚Äúits okay I do not need it for passport. it is for visa. she said: ‚Äú okay then you need to come back later.‚Äù with attitudes and smug faces.

Walgreens,Profiling and Prejudice,"I am 54 years old, I've had two major spine surgeries which leaves me in a lot of pain every day in which I have to see doctors for every month. I went to my local Walgreens at 9100 Telegraph Road and Taylor Michigan 48180 to get my prescriptions filled, I have many prescriptions for different health problems, some of them are for pain, like I said I get these prescriptions filled every month. The other day I went to get my prescriptions filled and they notified me that they would have to call my doctor's office to confirm my narcotic medication, which I said was fine and that I would be waiting for my medicine. After 45 minute wait I can hear that she was talking to my doctor's office, after the pharmacist got off the phone she came to me add immediately and told me she wouldn't be filling my prescriptions. I asked her why she wouldn't be filling them since she just spoke with my doctor's office, and she told me they wouldn't give her the information that she needed. I asked what information is that, she said she didn't have to tell me that, I said I'm the patient why can't you tell me, she said I'm the pharmacist and I don't have to tell you anything and then handing me my prescriptions and told me to go get them filled somewhere else. I then went to my doctor's office and ask them if anything had gone wrong during the conversation with Walgreens, she said no, they asked what your diagnosis was and I gave it to them and that was the end of it. I then went to another Pharmacy and filled my prescription without any hassle or problems at all. I went home and immediately called Walgreens corporate office to make a complaint about how violated I felt at the Walgreens store that I was dealing with, and also the pharmacy and their staff were saying things so loud arroungthe customer's, they could hear my medical business which to me violates HIPAA laws. I spoke to a lady at their corporate office who just takes down information and passes it on, and was told somebody would call me within the next two business days. The next morning I got a call from that person at Walgreens corporate office, I had told him exactly everything that had happened to me at the Walgreens store, including the fact that she was yelling my medical business out in front of everybody. I express to him that everything about my situation was legit right down to her calling my doctor's office to get the information she needed to fill my prescription and was still refused, and apparently the pharmacist gave quite a different story which is a lie. I even offered the person calling me to call my doctor's office to confirm that it was handled correctly, and he continued to defend his pharmacist saying she has the right to refuse anybody that she wants even if she's offending a loyal customer and a patient that does business at Walgreens. I was profiled and was discriminated against with prejudice.

Walgreens,let me first start by saying I have‚Ä¶,let me first start by saying I have never left a review for any company product or services I have received. However I am furious!!! Never again will I go to Walgreens!!! I bought a movie for my Granddaughter.... Turns out her Dad had already gotten it for her.... I had the receipt and the movie was not open still in its original package etc etc...... My Son tried to take it back...... They said they couldn't give him cash even though I had the receipt..... He would have to accept store credit or he could bring back my card and the charges could be...... So I take my mom up there.....WITH MY CARD..... they now say they cannot reverse the charges it has to be store credit.... No reason why just store credit that's all they can do...... So far time number 3 I go up there with the movie receipt and my charge card.... Get told they cannot reverse it or give me cash I ALREADY SPENT!!!!!but can give me store credit...... By this time I'm completely done with the situation and tell them just give me store credit....... I go to Walgreens on Sunday buy a few items.....

So again I take my mom up there today give her the card give her my credit card...... 5 minutes later she returns to the car with my items...... And the gstore credit card.... Turns out...store credit cannot be used to purchase the items I purchased today.!!!!...I spend ALOT of money at Walgreens......NEVER AGAIN......----CVS just got a new customer!!!!!,0,1

Walgreens,What a disgrace. Another American company that would be lucky to achieve mediocrity. But I'm sure having CEOs being paid as if delivering excellence.,"This is what happens when you have huge corporations and pop ups on every street corner. Once you have grown so large there is no fear of going under due to absolute ineptitude and complete inability to perform job duties. this is an absolute offense to the American educational institution. I have personally witnessed more professional highly trained staff members working for McDonald's oh, and these people are responsible for the health and welfare and in some instances life or death situations. The human race is dying my friends and it will be a slow death due to expectations of mediocracy being rewarded as excellence. I truly fear for the future of our children. Our country has lost all ambition and drive to become something more then just barely passing. I have dealt with nearly 15 different Walgreens stores and the brightest among them I would say probably got by with a d average from a community college and that it's giving him a little bit of Grace.I truly wish I could tell people to seek out small mom-and-pop pharmacies but unfortunately they've been eaten up by these large corporations that don't care about you and will one day give you a medication that will probably kill you. welcome to the future of pharmaceutical distribution good luck you'll need it",0,1

Walgreens,Very poor service. Leaving after 20 years.,"I received a message from ""Walgreens"" that a prescription was due. I ordered it and received a response that it would be ready with a scheduled pick up time. When made a special 30 mile trip to pick up, the pharmacy tech informed me ""it was too early."" I explained that I had received instructions it was but that did not matter. I spoke with manager ""Mike"" and was informed that the message was generated by a ""third party"" and that he would speak with his manager about the problem. I requested to be contacted, but nobody called. I got another message that another Rx was due. Again the same run around. On the second order I included a note requesting that if they could not honor the quoted pick-up date to please call me. But nobody called. So TWO wasted trips.THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS!!!! I have written before and nobody ever responded. Website contact form does not work. I will be posting this on google and every forum I can find. I am now in the process of transferring all my monthly scripts to Optum Rx, mail order. Thanks for nothing. Edward ""Ralph"" Kinsley",0,1

What if I am sick and my voice isn't functioning, yet it defaults to voice without a prompt for key touch. And then you need to waste your time listening to unimportant sales pitches on flu shots and other services before being able to do a simple order.Today I had an auto-refill not being filled so I called and had to wait to talk to a technician, who was clueless as to why I needed to talk to him. I had refills within window available. Then they said it would be ready at 1 PM 2 days from now. I didn't need it earlier, but asked why and was told he had to transfer me to a pharmacist. Not necessary, but if there wasn't a near monopoly in my neighborhood, I would go elsewhere.",0,1
Walgreens,Every part of dealing with pharmacy is ridiculously frustrating.,"I absolutely hate using Walgreen's as my pharmacy. To begin with, even the simplest call takes about 15 minutes: first to navigate the lengthy and extremely limited automated answering system (that has never once been able to actually help me with what I'm trying to do), then you get forwarded to a call center where no one is able to actually help you with anything other than telling you if your prescription is ready or not, then you inevitably get put on hold for however long it takes for someone from the actual physical pharmacy to answer, THEN you can speak to someone who might be able to do something. I've asked if there is any way to circumvent this system, I was told there is not. Visiting the pharmacy is somehow even more infuriating than calling. Whether it's 10 am on a Wednesday or 10 pm on a Saturday, or anywhere in between, there will always be a line in both the drive-thru and in the store. Usually only one tech will be working at the register while three other techs and two pharmacists fill prescriptions and chat in the back, in absolutely no hurry and without even glancing at the second unused register or the line of impatient customers. I have grown so frustrated with service at this pharmacy that I have given up and left without needed medications. I worked as a pharmacy technician for years, and if my store were to operate for just one day in the way that this one does the entire staff would be seriously reprimanded. After once again abandoning a barely moving line out of complete and utter frustration today, this time without antibiotics I need for an infection, I have finally decided to switch pharmacies. This Walgreen's is literally down the block from me, but that is no longer enough to keep my business. I am willing to drive into town for my prescriptions if it means never having to call or visit that place again.",0,1

Good thing it wasn't b/c the recording said they were closed for the Labor Day. Went inside and was told there was nothing they could do, I should come back tomorrow!C'mon people, I understand if you don't have a pharmacist for today but you have other stores in the area, and I'm sick today - I can be well on my way to feeling better by the time you open tomorrow.So I called MedExpress and asked them to send the Rx to CVS across the street, which they did.

Walgreens,Every time I have gone to the walgreens‚Ä¶,"Every time I have gone to the walgreens in dsm iowa (1330 university) they have something on the shelf marked as one price (on sale or clearance) and get to the check out and it's the wrong price, or it's not actually on sale or in the wrong spot. Last time the items were marked on sale, it was 8pm, and they said the prices weren't actually on sale until the next day. Tonight I went in to pick up a few things and there were face wipes on clearance and the sticker said the item clearly, but the person said that THIS item was in the wrong spot. ALL 6 PACKS OF THEM. Then proceeded to remove from the shelf, know that there was no empty spot for those wipes he removed, and told me that werent supposed to be there. Any time I have ever worked in retail. If the price was clearly marked and its somehow wrong due to the store failing to do their job (stocking shelves correctly) then we were forced to honor that price for them and THEN remove the item so the mistake didnt happen again. When did this process change. I literally barely go into this store anymore because it's always something messed up or ""marked wrong"". When does it end? When are employees held to standards? This person literally said ""no one does anything around here"" when I asked why this is happening YET AGAIN!!! SERIOUSLY!! Customer service isnt that difficult. If anyone gives a crap, send me an email and ask me questions. It's really getting old. We keep losing stores on this side of town and are being forced to shop in stores that have crap customer service so maybe make some changes",0,1

I am a professional that works in the courts with a Master's Degree, but I was rear ended on two occasions in the past four years, and that is AFTER my back was already injured. No one at Walgreens cared to elaborate on this pharmacist ""comfort"" while I am uncomfortable with pain. If the doctor wrote it, and Cigna approves it, why does the pharmacist have a say?

The Walgreens associate stated ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a big boy now; surely he is able to pick up his own prescriptions.‚Äù He then stated that he was going to try to help me and put me on hold for a few minutes. I thought, perhaps he was speaking to the insurance company or to the pharmacist. Instead, he comes back on the line a few minutes later and proceeds to give me the bus routes that my son can take in order to pick up his own prescriptions.

Walgreens,I am an employee for Walgreens and all‚Ä¶,I am an employee for Walgreens and all I have to say is never work here. I started the job when I was 16 and I am now 17 so I‚Äôve been there for a year and a half. In the time I‚Äôve worked here I have been harassed by another employee in the pharmacy ( I believe he was 20 and mind you I‚Äôm 17). He had found my Instagram and messaged me saying he ‚Äúwished I was a naughty girl‚Äù then when I blocked him he proceeded to call the store and ask for me. I have been pushed by an aggressive customer and my manager blamed it on me asking me what I could have done to prevent it and did not report it at all. I have been told that we cannot miss more than 9 days of work or we get fired EVEN IF WE HAVE A DOCTORS NOTE. I made sure to ask about that and the assistant manager (at the time) said that it‚Äôs true and that we should not miss that much time anyways. I asked him if I should just come in and throw up in a corner just so I can go home without being worried about termination and he agreed. They have a binder in the office with days circled that people missed and of course under my name they had the Day circled in January where I came into Walgreens clinic with a fever of 104 I distinctly remember handing the assistant manager my note and her telling me it‚Äôs okay but still getting that day circled on the calendar. I got my wisdom teeth pulled about two months ago and I took three days off for it. There was a complication and I was still in pain and taking the pain meds when I had to go back to work. Me being loopy was like I got this I can go to work but my mother which is my legal guardian said no and called the store to ask if I could have the day off so she called and talked to the assistant manager at the time and his words to her were ‚Äúso she can come in and walk around but can‚Äôt come to work‚Äù. The day of my surgery my mom stopped off at Walgreens to get us popsicles and me being high on laughing gas wants to go in and say hello to my team members and tell them I lived. So we go in and my mother is holding me up and I have cheeks the size of Texas and get my popsicles. We were in there for three minutes if not less but that was enough for him I guess. So I go to work still on the meds and thank god for the shift lead that night because she really helped me get through the day. But it is ridiculous that I had to go to begin with. There is another shift lead that is a horrible person to be honest with ya. She is really bothered about me taking a 15 minute break like everybody else gets because I get off at 10 and not 11 like other employees but I have to be up for school at 6 in the morning the next day. She went to the manager behind my back and complained about it so they changed me in the system as emancipated even though I am not and I still live with my mother just so they can make me work more and not give me breaks every 4 hours. They leak employees personal information. There is absolutely no positive reinforcement. Customers do surveys for the store and what they rate us is the NPS score. That is all the manager cares about because that determines if she gets a raise. But WE are the ones dealing with customers while she sits in the office. WE are the ones dealing with all these customers and making sure they feel welcomed and that they can find everything they need. She got a trophy for the NPS scores and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge us even though we are the reason she got it. They all talk bad about others and put people down. Management is awful.

Walgreens,pharmacist overstepping his discretionary bounds...,"I‚Äôve been very patient with this pharmacy...and generally the staff is decent but the new pharmacist at the Walgreens on eureka in redding completely oversteps his/her bounds and inconveniences my doctors office and myself. I recently needed to fill a pseudocontrolled med (not an addictive med but one that apparently is sold to weightlifters or something back east). I take it for a well documented genetic disorder aggravated by active kidney cancer as my pharmacy is well aware (though I am in the medical field myself and have always wondered why the pharmacists get so involved when they have had no training on pathology or clinical expertise). But I have endured this in silence until this. My physician sent an appropriate message that I may fill 2days early (something I have never done before). My MD is well aware it is because we will be out of state for the next two weeks. The pharmacy at first lied and said they didn‚Äôt receive anything...then when I went there in person, a more helpful employee explained that they received the faxed message from the MD but wouldn‚Äôt honor it unless they sent a new one saying ‚Äú...because of vacation‚Äù. A doctor wouldn‚Äôt send something like this without a good reason and is the only one qualified to really know which patients are abusive and which are sincere due to an ongoing in person clinical relationship. To be clear...this IS NOT something the state or insurance requires...but is somehow left to the flimsy whims of the pharmacist‚Äôs discretion (the one person who never meets me, doesn‚Äôt know anything about disease (many PharmDs fail even pharmacology when they try to switch to an MD track as I saw firsthand) and doesn‚Äôt do any measure of fill history obviously to differentiate the few people who sadly abuse the system to the vast majority of the rest of us.Air has consequences for the patients...and I think it is high time there was some accountability and consequence for those pharmacists who abuse this loophole or simply don‚Äôt have the judgement to make this kinds of decisions accurately. It gives good pharmacists who are trying to work WITH doctors and patients a bad name...and needs to be checked by some form of oversight.For this time, I will have to take my injection 3-7d late and have my doctor send a completely new RX to a pharmacy in Oregon (the closest to my remote family reunion is over an hour away). All because the pharmacist this Friday August 2 wanted the words ‚Äúfor vacation‚Äù added to the doctors ORDER to fill today on August 2 for what they knew to be a valid reason.I know the system is imperfect and most people are doing their best. I have endured this pharmacist filling my meds up to a week late numerous times and never raised a fuss. But at some point....enough is enough.",0,1

About 6 months ago I was told they would no longer be able to sell me cigarettes without my driver's license. I am 58 years old.yes take it as a compliment but to me it is aggravating as hell especially when they all know me. What got my goat was my mother was picking me up cigarettes for my birthday. She is 90 years old. They refused to sell them to her without a driver's license. They even called the manager over and said sorry we cannot sell them to her without an ID or driver's license. Rules are rules. Well the rules have lost a customer.",0,1
Walgreens,Poor customer service & pharmacy representative,I had a horrible experience with Walgreen's today. I take insulin and the pharmacist decided she'd change my insulin to the generic form without informing me of the change. Medicine isn't to be played around with folks is dying from certain forms of medication. She should have asked me to either check with my doctor or ask me if I wanted a generic form if there was a problem with my insurance. She was rude and disrespectful when I took the medicine back to the pharmacy another pharmacist had to apologize for her bad decision. I'm scared to take any medicine I had previously received from the pharmacy because of this huge mix up and her blatant disreguard for how she made me feel. She is not my doctor and if anything goes wrong with me because of the medicine I want people to know what happened to me and why!!!,0,1

Walgreens,7/9/2019,"7/9/2019Walgreens online let me down when I most need an electric pad to reduce my back pain.

I called again Walgreens customer service and lodged a complaint. It seems that FedEx changed the shipping time delivery. (But it was not true). Called FedEx and I was told that Walgreens did not process the item as expected. I won't recommend ordering nothing from Walgreens online. Whatever you see online for expecting time delivery is not exactly what you would get. Walgreens should list: 1 to 2 business days plus processing time (approx. one week). Therefore we, customers, would have the choice to go and chose another online shopping company where to buy our stuff instead to be mislead.",0,1

I do temporary fill in work and often have to travel where I may stay for weeks, working at a location far from home. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have been admonished for using pharmacies in different towns...I can‚Äôt possibly drive 350 miles home just to get my Rx when there is a Walgreens nearby.

Recently I moved 20 miles to a new home in a different city, and got castigated for always ‚Äòchanging pharmacies‚Äô! I‚Äôm not driving 20 miles every month to go get my Rx filled in a city where I no longer live, because the pharmacy staff gets some kind of weird satisfaction from criticizing their customers who suffer from chronic pain. Patients who suffer from chronic pain do NOT take meds for ‚Äòfun‚Äô.

Walgreens,Walgreens extort those who wants a simple passport photo,I wish Walgreens would extend their mission and purpose to their photo kiosks as they state many times to their other customers! I went there for a passport photo which I took with an app on my phone. Walgreens tells me even if I print out of the phone they will still charge me the full price of $15 regardless of the photo app. When I asked for them to do a regular print they enlarged the head and cropped off the top of my head so it CANNOT BE USED for a US passport! This is just outrageous behavior and I feel an element of greed between a $1/$2 item to $15! I for one no longer believe in their commitment to their mission and care and I do hope Dr Oz reads this review too.,0,1
Walgreens,Beware of Express Pickup Scheme,"Until today, I would have given Walgreens 5 stars. But they started an ""Express Pickup"" so-called ""service"". This ""service"" requires customers to go online to order prescriptions and provide payment information. This is ripe for massive fraud and sharing of personal medical information. While Walgreens claims that their systems are safe, we all know that the networks and service providers are not.Today I was 2nd in line at the pharmacy, but had to wait 25 minutes because so many have fallen for this unsecure ""Express pickup"" scheme. It was mostly older people, like me, standing and standing, struggling on a cane, that waited for 25 minutes. This time last month, I would have been done in less than 10 minutes. Those burdened by standing for long periods know not to have our rx information or financial information --- not to mention location --- all over cyberspace. This scheme may be ok for some (until they get hacked). But disabled should not be punished or jeapordized simply because we want to protect our privacy.",0,1

Walgreens,why do we allow substandard care?,"If I could give a negative star - I totally would. I understand things happen - like their computer system going down but the customer service is sorely lacking. I work in the medical field and Walgreens should be ashamed of themselves.

Finally got the request in and received confirmation they were ready to pickup. But when I went to pick them up I was told they hadn‚Äôt been Processed through my insurance because their systems were down. They said I should call in a couple of hours to check on them. So I called was; told that they were submitted and I could pick them up. Went through the drive through waited behind 4 cars, and was told they still weren‚Äôt processed, on top of that I had to come inside to get the situation resolved. Came inside - waited behind 5 people - and was told that they had to run them through all over again - because something happened when they ran them through and they basically had to start the process all over again - it would be 20 minutes. So I‚Äôm waiting for them now, but this is ludicrous - that they don‚Äôt have a better system for handlind issues and they don‚Äôt actually verify things before telling people that everything is ready. Instead of actually making sure the meds are ready they lie about verification & make you come in - wasting your time - and then they tell you there are still issues?! I have insurance, I have valid prescriptions, and I feel like I‚Äôve been abused by there ineptitude. Are you kidding me? What happened to patient care? This is medication and they are patient care providers but they clearly don‚Äôt care about the continuity of care that they provide.

Walgreens,"Bad Customer Service, Bad Management","For over 5 years I was a customer at Rite Aid 51 Tremont Street, Taunton, MA (the store is transitioning to Walgreen's now) from time to time. The store manager, Ed, never greeted me, which is very unprofessional. The store's energy and vibe always felt negative and...boring. However, I made a mistake by decided to go for an interview to make extra money. After the interview I had a bad gut feeling and was turned off and wanted nothing to do with the store's environment. 3 days after the interview, I received an email from Walgreen's saying I'm not a candidate. I wouldn't take the position even offered but I realized how screwed up the customer service is at this location and the company Walgreen's and Rite Aid after reading poor reviews from both companies on other sites and from my experiences. I decided I will no longer give my money to this location due to the repeated bad customer service. I learned just because you always go to a certain location, does not mean you are valued as a customer. So this store will no longer receive my money.

Walgreens,Money hungry,I've been going to the same Walgreens for almost 3 years. At least three times a month. There's not one employee down there that knows my name. To get a prescription refilled when there's no refills on it Walgreens will not help you in any means shape or form to get it. You're the one that has to notify your doctor. I've had them lose my prescriptions. I can't tell you how many times they've been out of stock of stuff. But my biggest complaint is they do not care about their patients at all. All they care about is money. If it wasn't such a hassle to change my prescriptions. I would not use Walgreens. In my opinion this is a terrible company. That does not care at all,0,1
Walgreens,I decided to go at Walgreens at Balboa‚Ä¶,"I decided to go at Walgreens at Balboa Ave, CA on January 10, 2019 and checked of their 70% off Christmas items clearance while waiting for my daughter's Kumon. Im with my youngest daughter and browsed their seasonal items. Checked out and found toy that I thought its on clearance but I refused to get them when they were full price. The cashier took it back but didn't removed it on the system. I paid and walked away to pick up my daughter. She wasn't done with her tutor. and had a chance to review my receipt. I looked and found the full priced toy still there. Other than that he modified some items that supposedly 70% off but rang them wrong. So we (with 2 kids) went back to get my money back and since Im already there I just wanted them to adjust the price for me. 1st the cashier who rang me up gave me a refund in a form of cash and marked my receipt RETURNED K.V.(Initials) Which I was surprised for not asking me if I would like cash or back to my card. Not a big deal. Next, It took him 5-7minutes to figure out how much he owe me. But I already know how much I should get back, I said its more than that because they were 39 pieces items. I asked him if somebody can help him. He said sure. Worst part ever, whoever supposedly helped him made it even a nightmare for me. My kids are getting bored and we were all tired, running around the store. I left her to get my kids back. For few seconds we couldn't find her but for a split seconds anything can happen. I got nervous and almost lost my young daughter. Went back to the register with my 2 girls. I carried my youngest daughter. Back to the supervisor/staff (no nametags) she said they were ringing right so she couldn't give my money back and the only way she can do is give me 10k reward points. I said I need my money back and i don't need points ( because Im decided to not go back to Walgreens at all at that time and still is). She seems pretty firm with her decision but Im getting embarrassed with other customers and Im hysterical about the points. I said thats enough and just going to call the corporate. She said, No we can fix this and i can give you 10k points. So she asked my rewards number and so I decided to tell her my reward number i said 912--- She said I have to used the pin pad. I said I can't Im holding my child( who I almost lost). I swear, she's having fun of me and thinking Im a child and under estimated me. I told her again my reward number and she's really close to the pin pad but she's acting that she couldn't reach it. There was a push cart in front of me and carrying my youngest daughter, I don't understand to the max level for being inconsiderate where in fact and in the first place they made me go back and should be apologetic. So I went to the pin pad and pressed my reward #. I was telling her do you think you're giving me a favor with your rewards? I need my money back I know its not much money but the fact that she was eager to embarrassed me that made me angry and especially almost lost my young daughter. At the end, she said would you like to get your baby a toy and I won't charge you. I said, No its okay. We left the store. I just love cheap items to giveaway to others but I dont create a scene to get free stuff. I called the corporate when we got home. Her Manager called the next day and wanted to fix it. He called back after weekend but I missed it. Still unresolved but I probably send my husband to get my refund. But Dang! I never go back there again.",0,1

I live up in Seattle for school and wanted to pick it up early so I didn't have to come back, which I've never had an issue with before, because my doctor wrote me a prescription with two refills on it on purpose, since she was aware of my situation. Rather than explaining this so called ""policy,"" on a ""controlled substance,"" the pharmacist, whose name was Darrin, was incredibly condescending and unkind. When we continued to ask questions of him and try to figure something out, he threw a fit and refused to offer help or proper solutions. I told him that he could speak to my doctor, but he instead told me that my reason for coming early (which was that I didn't want to make the trek down all the way to Milton for my prescription), was not a good enough ""excuse"" to tell my doctor. In the past, I have had transphobic and rude pharmacists, but every time we were able to still come to a solution of some sort. I would not want any trans people to have to deal with this pharmacist or any of the other rude pharmacists who work at this Walgreens, because I have always walked away feeling frustrated and upset in my interactions, whether I received my prescription or not.

And if 5 minutes after placing an order you notice that you shipped to the wrong address, there's not way to make a change online, as is possible with every other retailer I buy from. Awful. THEN when you call, a rep says she'll ""send a note"" but can't guarantee that it'll fix the situation. 2 hours later I called back to see if it had been fixed--was told there was nothing in the record that anything had been done but now IT WAS TOO LATE. Insane! I asked to speak to a supervisor who promised she'd fix the address issue and call me back. Nope.... never called so I called back and found out the supervisor had put through the WRONG information--seriously??? So I called AGAIN and ask a rep who double talked me to connect me to a supervisor. She said she'd message the carrier (not sure how it was at a carrier since it wasn't going to ship for 3-5 days) to ASK that the address be fixed--no guarantees. I have NEVER had a worse experience with any online retailer and I buy almost everything online.STAY AWAY from Walgreens online!!!",0,1

So I handed over my UK/EU drivers licence, a document I have used to hire a car, check in to hotels, and as security on numerous iPod self guided tours of the historic buildings here in Charleston. I was told I needed ‚Äúvalid‚Äù ID. When I asked what this was I was told American ID. I explained that I‚Äôm not American, and offered to fetch my British passport from the hotel. No, only American and Canadian passports are ‚Äúvalid‚Äù ID. Naturally, I didn‚Äôt get my wine, nor did I buy the chips - who wants to eat a bag of chips without a glass of something!While I appreciate that Walgreens has a social responsibility to not sell alcohol to minors, defining such a tight criteria of acceptable ID seems pretty xenophobic to me and not really justified when I have been able to use my drivers licence as ID to do much more potentially dangerous things like hire a car.

I had purchased an item at a different Walgreens, that I thought was the same as one I have been looking for, unfortunately, it was not. Much to my surprise and disappointment, I would have only received 1/6th of the price that I paid, when returning to another store, because of this company's clearance return policy. Nowhere on the receipt does it state that clearance items are subject to different return policies, only that ""We reserve the right to limit or refuse a refund"". However, the receipt does state that ""With original receipt, items will be exchanged or refunded for the full purchase price. Refunds will be issued in the original method of payment."" This is truly concerning for me, as my family and I are loyal Walgreens shoppers. I was trying to return an item that I paid $19 for and would have received $4, with a receipt! I just cannot believe that even with a receipt, I will receive the lowest price in the store I am returning in. Unfortunately, the Walgreens I purchased the items from is of considerable distance from me and it will be an inconvenience to travel there for a return, especially after I asked the associate, who rang me up, if I could return without hassle.

Walgreens,Having been a customer of Walgreens in‚Ä¶,"Having been a customer of Walgreens in New Port Richey, Florida for well over 3 and a half yrs since moving down, when my original Walgreens closed I had to move my prescriptions over to another one a few blocks away.

Of COURSE there is a problem. I can see a pharmacy being careful. I can see them checking out pain scripts but what I cannot see is leaving patients to sit without their meds they've been on for well over 12 yrs, even after a doctor has contacted them assuring them that all is legitimate, still I sit since yesterday midday with no meds. It's just sickening to me, having had chronic diseases all these yrs, that a junkie could waltz in and get them with no problem, yet I am an established, long time customer with them, been on these same meds for many yrs and because THEY closed my regular Walgreens I must now go without until THEY decide, NOT my doctor, whether they will fill my prescription or not, leaving me sitting in unnecessary, non-stop neuropathy & RA pain, all for chitz and giggles apparently. Is it that they don't trust their very own Walgreens pharmacists at their neighboring stores to decipher if their long time customer is a druggie or not, that they must try to decide if they may just be, they aren't the patient's doctors, they do not have any right to be playing God with people's lives and health, it's not like I have chosen to be sick and live on these meds, would give ANYTHING to not have to go thru this bs just to survive and have a halfway decent life. It's wrong and not their job to decide if I am ""worthy"" of receiving my medications or not, that is my actual doctors' jobs, their only job is to fill my precriptions as were ordered. Soooo wishing my original area Walgreens store had not closed but sure pity any of their other customers who are having to go thru this bs as well.

I am told that I will receive a 25% discount and when I went back to pick it up, I am told that they can't do that. I think that quality of service needs to be taught to employees. It's like they want to be fired so they can get unemployment. Some of the employees like Latoya made an effort to talk with the manager, who did help me out . Your online survey is not user friendly as you have to agree to unreal terms and conditions.",0,2

Walgreens,I will never go back!,"I will never go back to a Walgreens in Placerville, CA. Rude rude rude pharmacist and pharmacy techs. No customer service skills or tact. Couldn't believe it. Wouldn't listen or help. I've never been treated so poorly. Went to CVS and they listened, helped, and found the problem and fixed it.",0,1
Walgreens,walgreens.com,Most of us can find drugstore items in store and just grab them on the go without much thought. Walgreens always has a good selection and at good prices. I though was searching for a specific gift to give to someone and walgreens.com had the best price but it was only available online. They offer free shipping to any of their stores and free shipping to home for orders $35 or more. I chose a few more items and had them shipped for free to the home. I placed my order just before noon on a Thursday and had my complete undamaged package in my hands just before noon that Saturday.,0,5
Walgreens,Prescription Review,"For scripts, it is Walgreens! 53rd and 15th St, Bradenton, FL 34203 employees work tirelessly with great attitudes!!!! It is a pleasure. When they say they will contact dr or insurance co, they DO AND FOLLOWUP WITH CUSTOMER!!! 90 % of battle is encompassed in this last sentence!!",0,5

Walgreens,Walgreens taking FOREVER to ship my order,I used to happily use drugstore.com and now the site transfers to Walgreens.com and the service SUCKS. I placed my order 3 days ago and it still hasn't even shipped. My orders from drugstore.com used to come the next day or the day after. Meaning I RECEIVED my order faster than Walgreens is even getting around to sending it out. This is my second try and I waited and waited last times too. I'll be looking elsewhere where they care about customer service.,0,1
Walgreens,Never again,"It's been 5 business days since I placed my order, and still processing!! Their customer service is a joke, they don't have a clue.",0,1
Walgreens,Broken Communication System,"WalgreensIt is unfortunate that the service at Walgreens at 2201 N. Heritage St, Kinston, NC is not improving despite nine months of constantly sending out wrong phone messages to customers and showing a lack of courtesy to customers at the drive through. On February 11, 2016, I called to see if my prescription was filled that the doctor had faxed over and I was informed that it was ready. I picked up my high blood pressure medication only to learn it was the wrong medication IRBESARTAN/ 150-12.5MG) and the store had now closed. I had two more pills remaining, so I called the next day and I returned on February 13, 2016 to pick up my medication. I was given a generic brand (Valsartan/HCTZ 80MG/12.6MG) that I do not take and I informed the pharmacy assistant that it was not the correct medication and I had to return an hour later to get the correct high blood pressure medication (Diovan HCT 80MG/12.5MG). My prescription had to be renewed after my fourth-month checkup and the problem started again, with Walgreens pharmacy trying to give me the generic brand. Then I started getting calls that I had prescriptions waiting and when I followed up on the call, it was for another person. Twice, I was unable to get my prescription filled because the pharmacist assistant stated the drug store did not have the pills in stock. I was on automatic refills and was taken off in June for some reason. I was informed in September 2016 that my prescription was not filled because they thought it was a mistake because it cost $64.00. On November 21, 2016, I received a robo-call from Walgreens informing me that my prescription was ready to be picked up. Today, November 22, 2016, I went through the drive through at approximate 8:20 pm to pick up my prescription and the pharmacy assistant asked for my name and date of birth and then informed me that no prescription was ready for me. She stated there was nothing for me, come back in 30-45 minutes and she rudely turned around and walked away. My husband blew the horn and no one would come to the window. After sitting at the window for about 5 minutes the pharmacy assistant went over to the pharmacist and they started laughing. When the assistant left, the pharmacist got on the phone and asked if she could help us that we come inside. My husband asked the pharmacist to give me one pill for tonight and we will come back tomorrow. The pharmacist then called someone and a manager came out some minutes later and she said it was not the Walgreens policy to have other customers behind us waiting. We had actually waited 15 minutes to get to the window because of a customer ahead of us. I asked my husband to please drive around. I have had enough of the mistakes, rudeness, and refusal to correct and update information in the Walgreens system regarding receiving other people phone calls. I trust that this will be followed up by Walgreens Headquarters because giving wrong medication is a serious matter, not having medication on hand, and the rudeness is totally unwelcomed.",0,2
Walgreens,pharmacy customer service,"Rainbow City, AL Pharmacy Manager, Courtney Russell, is the rudest person I have ever encountered in business and I am 75 years old. This is just part of the rudeness - I called to inquire if my husband's prescriptions were ready. Her answer was, ""What do you think we are doing down here making hamburgers? If you don't like our schedule I suggest you get another pharmacy."" Huh? When I arrived to pick up the meds, the rant started again. I told her I did not want to talk to her, just get my meds. She then pointed out - on the meds envelope that the meds were due to be filled at 4:16 and she had made that shedule. I can understand being busy, but not extreme rudeness. And incidentally, they were NOT busy. No one was in line either in front or behind me. They she called me a liar when I said I had already swiped my credit card. NO. YOU. DID. NOT! Twice. Then I notice the machine had a chip reader. So I said, oh, here's the problem - our machine has a chip reader. She screams, "" Do you think I am a mind reader? How am I supposed to know your card has a chip?"" She inquired if I were a pharmacy. No, my daughter is though. She - ""Then maybe you need to talk to her about how she does business. Have you ever worked in healthcare? Yes, I have, I said. She replied, So you THINK you have worked in healthcare... (I am a retired HR Manager from two hospitals.) ""You need to find another pharmacy,"" she said - quite loudly. And I did. I filled out a complaint form while in the store and was promised a follow-up call. This happened on September 3, 2016. Still waiting. Talked to a friend who said she made her mother cry, another who said she berated her father for not being able to pronounce the name of his med. Testimonies are availab le. This is the same pharmacist who, on July 14, 2016 dispensed Ultram to my husband without any mention that it must not be taken before, during or after alcohol use. When, in fact, dangerous side effects or death can occur when alcohol is combined with Ultram. No warning on the label, no mention by the pharmacist. Label just says, ""May cause drowsiness, alcohol may intensify the effect.""",0,1
Walgreens,Pharmacy is terrible.,"I am transferring all of my prescriptions away from this heartless, unsmiling, unhappy, overworked place. I've had my scrips filled for 10 years at Walgreens. No more will I put up with their sullen treatment. Today was the last straw.",0,1

Walgreens,Only place I can consistently find stuff,"So, I'm allergic to lots of product ingredients, but weird ones, so I'll end up with like one brand of deodorant and one brand of sunscreen I can use. I order in bulk usually, but sometimes you run out or are traveling. Walgreen's is the only place I've ever been able to always run in and find it!",0,5
Walgreens,Honoring Price is Huge,"I purchased several ""Sale"" items at a Walgreens in Marietta, GA. Normally, I am very happy with the customer service, prices and sales. On this particular date, there were huge banners showing sales prices and savings. But, when I went to check-out, several items were no longer on sale and the cashier had no interest in making sure I got the items for the sales price. I ended up returning over 3/4 of the items I purchased, due to the lack of organization, knowledge and customer service. It goes to show you that customer service can go a long way.",0,3
