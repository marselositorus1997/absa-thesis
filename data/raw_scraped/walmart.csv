Walmart,What has happened at Walmart,Went to walmart yesterday to see the mess they have created by eliminating full service checkout and forcing customers to do the checkout themselves. What happened to customer service 🤔. Apparently it's gone. They are charging higher prices and we have to scan and bag ourselves?? I asked 3 different clerks where they moved the magazines from the checkstands where they used to be. None of them knew. Not going back.,0,1
Walmart,Delivery Date late.,"Delivery Date late.It was indicated when I placed my order it would arrive April 29, 2021. Instead it arrived May 7, 2021. I called customer service to expedite the order, and they did, after a few days had passed from the promised delivery date.The order arrived in Good condition, but if Walmart is attempting to compete with Amazon, they'll definitely have to do better or get left behind.",0,3
Walmart,Terrible customer service represenatives.,I ordered a bed 11 days ago. It was shipped to a non existing address. I called customer service to correct the problem. It was never fixed. Finally I cancelled after waiting 9 days. The next day I received a email saying that it was delivered. It was never delivered. I'm still waiting for my refund. I've called about my refund twice. Was given a conformation number. My refund is still not back in my bank account. I will never purchase anything again from Walmart. In store or online.,0,1

Walmart,Do not buy gift cards or any kind,Do not buy gift cards or any kind. The store has no sign that says if you buy you can not return you are sol when you buy them. The only sign is at the front of store at customer service. Store employee didn't even know you couldn't return it. Who is going to walk to the front of store to check their policy on returning item. What's new it's a big business that can screw over the customer and they dont care. Your problem if you buy from walmart.,0,1
Walmart,"Never ever get a pay raise, dont ever get gravely ill...!!","Never ever get a pay raise. Unless it's part of your first two years there, there are no pay raises unless you want or decide to get promoted. As a manager you have no family life. They suck the life all out of you with 12 and 15 hour days, day after day. There is no teamwork. The managers don't even talk among themselves as friends and acquaintances. It's really sad that way, no unity, overworked. And if your a female it's walking into the boys club. I won't elaborate on this because you can't 'prove it' . But as a guy,....Good luck! Between my wife and I having over 35 years service to the company we never ever not even once saw a person get a pay raise. No raise without promotion no matter how good you are! Experience means nothing. If your a woman..you simply overlooked for most everything. Unless your one that gets along really, really well with the right boss, then your fast tracked! Boys like pretty girls. Its a boys club, all about Pets pick! Open door policy by appointment only. I thought florida might be different.I was termed when I was sick in the hospital. Never got a chance to keep my life insurance or anything. I got a letter 3 months after I got home. Talk about upstanding places to work , eh?!!",0,2

Walmart,A special employee Tammy Ridriguez   at Walmart,"I want to give Tammy Ridriguez a special thank you for the help she gave to me on 5-3-21. I was waiting for online order pick up at Walmart 7800 Summer Creek Dr Fort Worth Tx 76123. I stepped out of my vehicle and accidentally locked my keys in my car while running and had my dog inside. She offered me her phone so I could call a locksmith, brought me a water and kept checking on me to make sure all was ok. She went above and beyond her ability to help me in my situation. While others might have just went about doing their job, Tammy did her job and helped me at the same time. Tammy was a huge help for me, as I could have been stranded there for hours, but with her help it was a quick set back for me. I’ll never forget her amazing ability to calm me and let me know it was all going to be ok. She was my Angel and I appreciate her dearly. I owe her a lot. Thank you again Tammy.",0,5

As such, I have a 490.00 Debt with my CC company (which Im certain they will be of assistance) and NO BIKE for my little boy. THIS IS A DROP SHIP GARBAGE DUMP!

They assigned the same tracking number to both orders. The box I ordered is out of stock so it is doubtful I will ever get it. They said they sent an email to the import seller. Obviously this is a Walmart issue not a 3rd party seller and they refused to do anything other than email a 3rd party seller. Worst online experience ever. Not to mention that you can't trust Walmart with your money. I don't feel good about a refund any time soon after speaking with them.",0,1

I spoke to TWO different Walmart agents on the phone and they both REFUSED TO GIVE ME A REFUND FOR MY DAMAGED ITEM. This is unacceptable. Walmart is a scam and they are a bunch of thieves!! I lost all my money because Walmart stole it and robbed me. Walmart doesn’t care about their customers. All they care about is themselves. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ORDERING ONLINE FROM WALMART. You will get scammed and robbed by them just like me. Highly NOT recommended. Enter at your own risk but don’t be surprised you dont get your money back. I pray so hard that this company shuts down permanently like Blockbuster and i pray Walmart loses their business for robbing my money,0,1

Now after that she walked away and I thought it was fixed and it had a different price, wat I grabbed at the beginning was a glue mouse trap said 2.97. And when she finished fixing the problem at the self service I looked to see how much it was for me to pay for it and it said pay 11.00 for it. I flagged her back down and told her this is a mistake, the price on the traps said 2.97, she said let me get a manager. The manager comes over and looked at the machine and told me that this is the final price for this item. And I told her the price is wrong. And she told me that she couldn't drop the price for the item like I was looking for a price drop. So disputable. I felt so low and said whatever and walked away. Went to busy beaver and bought it instead and it was only 2.87 and bought 4 traps the same Walmart was saying was 11.00. And the lady made me feel like I was looking for a price drop. Shame on you.

What kind of crap is that? There are 50 employees stocking shelves and sitting around chilling but no customer service. Then on top of that no cashier's. The lines had 15 people in them and reached half way thru the store. I thought managers were trained to work all stations. I guess I was wrong. Well we had over $200 in stuff so we just left it.

Walmart,The worst customer service.,"The worst customer service. Have been trying to do a pay in store order for almost a month. After multiple attempts the managers at the store contacted their help center and where told that the systems where not working together correctly. I was given the choice to either keep trying or to pay for the items online and bring them back into the store so they could do a resale of the items in order to change how the items where paid for. After doing this I am being told that they can not do that due to the part numbers not being in the computer to do this and that I would need to contact customer service. I have been given a phone number by email from the online customer service saying that is to a special store team and they would be able to help me. I have spoken to 8 different people 4 of them stated all they could do was a return and that I would have to take them back to the store and then hung up. One of them gave me a number saying that I could go through this department, but the number that was given to me was to a different insurance company. Then I tried calling again and was bounced to different people and departments after I asked to speak with a supervisor due to being told different things by every one and not getting any help with the problem. After being bounce around to different departments and still not speaking to a supervisor they had put me on hold and after a few minutes was hung up on again. As it stands after this I may never buy from Walmart again.",0,1

Not one person was willing to help me beyond saying that the warehouse is preparing it. I was still being told on April 20 that it WILL arrive by April 16th. After days of calling, getting hung up on, told that there isn't anything they can do ... I was actually told by a Walmart representative to reorder on Amazon because I would receive it that way. On April 22 they decided to put it in as lost in transport and reordered it. I am still, 1 month after I ordered for any information. I still haven't received a tracking number. I keep asking them to transfer me to someone that can actually help if you are unable to. I tried emailing the CEO with no response. At this point I feel like I was robbed. As a customer, I did my job ... I ordered, I paid and at this point, it appears that Walmart either can't or won't fix any problems and take care of customers. I lost a job that I was supposed to start because my car had to be the shed that I ordered and haven't received. This has been the worst experience ever.",0,1
Walmart,WATCH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT,"WATCH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT! HORRIBLE WALMART.COM EXPERIENCES! Walmart needs to do a major overhaul of it's online ordering and delivery process. Free delivery doesn't always mean honest, professional and reliable. After sitting on hold for well over an hour, nobody ever came to the phone. Walmart charged me $128+ for products that I still have not received! That toyed around with something as simple as a $3.54 box of Q-tips they either counldn't figure out whether they had them in stock or not, b c my bank account showed this amount being constantly either debited or credited on my account. Now, customer service eventually got back with me to, so-called, escalate my complaint of not ever receiving anything at my door after many orders placed with them since last year, while the process was haphazard and disorganized, I never, until yesterday spent this much money at one time in an order, then, never receive the actual products that they swear FedEx delivered to my door yesterday. I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint requesting a refund, b c I don't play games with companies stealing or messing around with my hard earned money while they mismanage their businesses then charge me for $128 worth of products that I am still looking out the door to see if the boxes will ever turn up!!! I don't recommend placing any orders with them. While FEDEx, I think, is generally good, either they never delivered my items, delivered to wrong address, or delivered and were stolen by either FedEx or someone else. Either way, I want my money back and won't stop until I get it. I have Legal Shield and it won't cost me one more dime to get my attorney after Walmart in this instance. If I don't hear from the Better Business Bureau within 5 days, the CEO will be hearing from my attorney about how his operations are not professionally operating....in my experience and opinion!",0,1

Other than a wait and see within 48 hrs. e-mail status cancel confirmation. Poor service. Especially since their policy says that an order can be cancelled IF still being processed?",0,1
Walmart,False advertising,They advertise purchase online and same day pickup at store. They contact you by email and let you know they recieved order and it's processing. You will be contacted by email when ready. They charge your account and then you don't hear from them again. I contacted the store and customer service and neither could help. They said I should understand They are busy. If so they should not say same day pickup and not charge for product unless they can supply it. Worst service ever!!!!!,0,1
Walmart,"Walmart.com destroys lives. Better off buying from a an armed robber. They are at least not going to go after your home, work, and banks all to get....nothing.","I have been a Walmart shopper for years, like many others, due to covid, online has become the new normal method of shopping. Over the years I have bought a few things from walmart.com. Nothing of not, not fast, not cheap, just worked kind of. Trying it again, I bought a gift for my daughter, went great, no problem, fast, and cheap. A couple weeks later my niece's birthday, she lives 1200 miles away, I thought this would work great. I made the purchase, the order was canceled. I was trying a new credit card to see if it was active, I figured it wasn't so I tried it again, but with a different card that I know worked......Canceled again. I contact the bank for the first card, they said, no the order was canceled by the merchant, since my account was new it would be a few days to know why. OkI called the second. They were unable to access my account at this time due to a pending fraud investigation. Upset with the whole situation, I was going to a physical store, stopped for gas, went to use my debit card. Declined, all three of my other cards, the same. I call each one of the banks... All 3 said the same thing. WALMART reported me for FRAUD for making a purchase through their service. I REPEAT, ALL I DID WAS PURCHASE FROM WALMART.COM WITH A VISA. I cannot stress the negative effects. I have sustained a 93 point drop overnight in my credit score, I have no money, because all of my accounts are frozen, I was denied for the apartment we were about to move into and I lost my new job because I was reported for fraud for buying from them, by them online, with my accounts, with money in the accounts. Run, before they can get you too. Run. Thieves, monsters, sociopaths, they said they will discontinue their investigation in 90 days if they don't have proof by then. I don't have any money, any home, any job, not any way of getting them either thanks to buying from walmart.com they have no remorse for their actions. We are not people to them. We are just a currency source.",0,1

Walmart,This review process sucks,"This review process sucks, just like Walmart, and their rude and lazy associates. My cashier, Angela from the Broadway store, actually threw my toilet paper at me today. Way to go Angela you have such awesome customer service skills, and why, just because I did not want to stand in two lines to pay for my things. I would seriously give you and Walmart negative 5 stars if it were an option. Over the years I have come to hate Walmart, and this just takes the cake. I was actually told by an associate last summer 2020 that Walmart does not give a poop about their customers. It is totally true, I already knew this by associates attitudes and inability to provide decent customer service skills evident by the hundreds of times I have gone to the customer service center to find one associate and a line. Does your associate call for help nope they do not care if the customer has other things to do besides stand in a line waiting and waiting and for what so this god awful store can save a buck with fewer associates instead of properly staffing your store so customers can get in and out that need to.I do not mind having to have to buy my makeup in the makeup dept but I should not be expected to then go elsewhere to pay for the rest of my stuff. you guys are the ones that made it so certain things have to be purchased in their dept so let customers pay for their other things as well. It is unprofessional and rude to throw my toilet paper at me. I will never come back to any Walmart.Wake up Walmart, it is ok to want to be top business, but good god take care of the people that make your business top of the line. Thumbs down to all of you!!!",0,1
Walmart,Don't buy electronics from Walmart,"What a horrible experience buying an Evoo computer. I had it plugged in most of the time. When I finally unplugged it the battery was dead. The people servicing the computer had it for six weeks. During that time I asked multiple times for an update and never got one. Now, six weeks later they tell me it can't be fixed and they're sending me a new one. Who goes without their computer for six weeks? During this time Walmart was absolutely no help, directing all my inquiries to Evoo. I thought buying a computer from Walmart and buying the extended warranty would make it easier to deal with any problems. Wrong...Do not buy electronics from Walmart.",0,1
Walmart,Total incompetence,"I am a regular WM customer, spending hundreds of dollars every month for food and other necessities. Today I went to WM and their incompetence registered a new low. I wanted a watch battery which I have purchased at WM for probably 20 years. At the jewelry dept. No one was there so I approached another associate and asked that they call for help to sell me a battery. The associate stated that they don't sell watch batteries. I asked if she was sure and she, obviously annoyed, walked over to another associate in the customer service dept. I couldn't hear the conversation but the first associate came back and stated that watch batteries are sold in the electronics dept. I knew this was erroneous but walked back to electronics and asked the young man for a watch battery. He stated that they don't have watch batteries and to go to the jewelry dept. Now frustrated I asked the associate to call for a manager. He did page a manager and I waited for another 15 minutes and no one came. I had already shopped for two other items from produce and pharmacy and walked up to the jewelry counter and left a cucumber and antacid meds on the counter. I gave up...I subsequently went to a Target store and bought the needed batteries, cucumbers, and meds.",0,1

Walmart,I ordered online from walmart.com a…,"I ordered online from walmart.com a printer, a Hewlett-Packard printer. Not knowing at the time that they were dealing with another company that they received the printer from and selling it I guess as the lady quoted to me a marketplace. Well I paid for the printer online I gave them their money online. I received the printer unknowingly I didn't open it right then because I'm trying to start my business and was organizing everything. When I did open it the printer was low in ink and I found that very suspicious. I had not used the printer why would it be low ink. Then I call Walmart they tell me about this third party company called Northridge tech. First it's hard to get in contact with the company the third party company, then no one wants to deal with me because they're saying I'm outside of the return dates window as they call it. My problem here was I wasn't asking for a refund, I just wanted to return this printer because not only did the printer not have ink, the printer doesn't print for your business cards or labels and I wasn't under I wasn't aware of that. I was just trying to get a printer that would help me to do my business and this printer does not apply to any of these things. No one I do business with Walmart groceries everything I have been doing business with Walmart never did I think in my wildest dreams that they do not care for their customers who are loyal customers enough to find a resolution when I'm spending money with them I even had groceries delivered there were of no use because the fruit went bad within 24 hours I didn't ask them for any money, I just threw the food out and then when I'm talking to you all you talk to people such as myself and I'll leave it at that like we are nothing, like our money isn't green and you let companies that don't have any consideration for your customers mess up your good name, so I have reached this conclusion I will never ever in my life waste money or time at walmart.com. if I want something I wanted out of Walmart I'll walk through the door and get it come if there is anything I want from Hewlett-Packard I will go to Hewlett-Packard and get it. One thing I do know for sure I have been dealing with Amazon and never have I ever had this problem. Amazon gets things and they sell them from all parts of the country. Let me tell you this though when you want to return something to them all they going to ask you is why you returning it and that's optional other than that, you take it to Kohl's or wherever else and they're going to give you your credit and there there is no problem they don't give you no problems and that's who I will be dealing with and I suggest anyone else who don't want problems leave walmart.com alone if you don't walk inside and get it leave it alone.",0,1

Due to Walmart's egregious, deceptive practice of using an unreliable 3rd vendor corruptly & conveinantly based in New Jersey so that they may take NO responsibility. The actions of their vendor 'The Main Guy' was either careless or deliberate & his action cost me $20.00 more dollars to return the not working laptop I purchase through Walmart. Walmart Customer service then sent an email saying they would have sent me a return label. However this is a lie. I made 3 separate phone calls to Walmart customer service. The 3rd one told me I was NOT eligible for a return label due their use of a 3rd party vendor. Next, the vendor, The Main Guy sends me an email instructing me to go to Paypal, pay an additional fee to get my refund. Why? Walmart took my money via my debit card.

Walmart,Ok .....so were do I start,"Ok .....so were do I start? Almost 3 weeks ago I got an alert on my phone letting me know that Walmart had gpu for sale at MSRP. and after 4 months of looking and searching I was so ecstatic that I finally found one through a vendor called Veveo and to my surprise I got the order in before it sold out . Now any one that has been looking for a graphics card know how hard its been and how frustrating it is trying to get a card for your computer considering all the bit coin miners and bots buying up all the gpu in seconds, and after 4 months I thought the search was FINALY OVER!!........ Or was it ... For 2 weeks the order stayed in preparing order stating the tracking will be available soon. It was to be delivered on the 13th of April, and even Walmart swore up and down DONT WORRY REST ASSURED IT IS COMING!!! Then in my e mail after almost 3 weeks of frantic waiting I received a message after sending 3 Emails receiving no responses SRY WERE SOLD OUT THE IDEM WE SOLD YOU IS NOW ON BACK ORDER WE ARE REFUNDING YOU TODAY AT 9PM. {still haven't received the money} so basically the sold me a product they didn't even have , causing me not only anxiety and mental stress, but also depression . I honestly feel like I was cheated cause the idem is still up on Walmart stating it is coming and just for curiosity I decided to call Walmart to confirm yet again the statics of the order .... and low and behold the same response { From Mohammed @ Walmart CS} DONT WORRY REST ASSURED IT IS COMING!!! So in hindsight its a breakdown in communication and I wish things could of been better handled, like oh I don't know ,,,,, don't sell things you don't have to people and leave them hanging for 3 weeks , And defiantly do not send them an Email the day of telling them they are S.O.L . I understand that things in life happen and you can't control the world ... I get that . but this was a ball drop if i ever seen one. I am leaving one star just for the fact that the idem was sole under M.S.R.P and not at scalper prices . for that I give credit, but honestly the company { or company's} should make this right and find the same card I purchased and ship it to me honoring the original purchase agreement. If this is or some thing similar is done I will change my review but at this time in my opinion is, buying from this vendor is a 50/50 risk just be prepared you may or may not receive you order that was processed even know you received a verification e mail .Now lets see how long it takes to either recive the card that was promised or the refund....",0,1

Walmart,Walmart driver ran me off the road & almost killed me!!!!!,"On March 11th at around 12:50pm I was driving west on Derry from Mississauga. I was near the intersection of Derry & Winston Churchill in the left hand lane. To my right was a Walmart truck driver also going straight. He made eye contact with me as he was ahead of me and he was checking his blind spot which was when he saw me. Regardless, he decided to make a very sharp lane change forcing me to move to my left and into the turning lane or he would have hit me dead on. I had no time to check to my left and to ensure I was safe to go over and if a car had been there, we would have gotten into a 3 car collision. I was able to get back over and continue straight on Derry. I was very shaken up and confused as to what had just happened. The driver of the truck slowed down and somehow then got behind me and began to tailgate me until we got to the next set of lights which at that point, he passed me again and drove into the left hand lane and made a sharp left and went on to drive south. He was clearly trying to cause an accident or he was maybe under the influence of some sorts. I managed to get a picture of his truck and his license plate. The genteman was in his early 30's perhaps, dark skin and wearing a mask. I have filed a police report with the Halton Police and also ""attempted"" to reach out to escalate to Walmart. I have been chasing them since the event which was 5 weeks ago & not a single person has given an ounce of care to deal with me. Every time I call in, I am placed on hold and then get told I will be transferred to the ""right department"". From there, I get transferred to a dead number or the number continues to ring with nobody answering. I have been told my matter has been escalated to the transportation department, the President's Group and that I will get a call back. As noted, it's been 5 weeks. The entire system is corrupt and they have done this intentionally so nobody can get in. When you email them, they refer you to the same phone number and when you call them, they tell you to email them. Shame on you Walmart and for the countless employees I have spoken with who again, could not care less to speak with me, take down my information, own it and let me know that the proper course of action has been taken to address the driver of that truck on that day. Imagine I had my children in the car or there had been a horrible accident caused by his carelessness causing me injury or even death.

So you're thinking you're getting a legit item that's not even there. Pure stupidity. What's the point of having a website If you can't even keep up with it. This is the third time this has happened. Now I have to wait 5 days for the refund which I understand is normal but is also pathetic. Never again online. Lol I'll just check other stores or wait for it to restock.",0,1

Supposed to be a headboard, and the item delivered is a small tube of clean and clear cream. Someone messed up. It needs to be made right.

Walmart,Online grocery? Scam!,"Their online grocery and “customer service” is an awful scam. I ordered $200 worth of groceries on Saturday morning paying extra for same-day delivery. When my groceries were an hour late I called the customer service and the only thing they told me was to “wait until the end of the day” at which point I had to cancel my plans for the rest of the day. When on Sunday my order was still not here I reached customer service again and they told me that “my order is out for delivery and should arrive within next few hours”. I asked them if it’s for sure going to be deliver that they and they responded yes. So I cancelled all my Sunday plans and waited a whole day for the delivery that never arrived. At this point I called the customer service once more and they said that my order was auto-cancelled (I haven’t been informed about it at any point, I’ve gotten no updates or informations this whole time whatsoever). They avoided answering my question about when I’m going to receive the refund - I still don’t know and still haven’t received it. Besides that they weren’t able to answer any of my questions like “why did it happen”. Ridiculous parody of a “service”.",0,1

You can call any Walmart store across the nation and 90 percent of the time nobody in the dept you need will answer. I was looking for a new riding mower. I called the randleman NC store.

The customer service agents also have no proper training they are robotic and don't seem to care. Walmart uses FedEx Ground service which is outsourced to route owners who employ people and give them lower wages and no benefits. FedEx Express (air shipments) hires people directly and they get benefits from FedEx Express but FedEx Ground & Home Delivery is outsourced to route owners and those route owners can hire just about anyone and yes some of them open and steal packages and I've seen them toss packages at your door to save 10 seconds. I'm sure most of the FedEx Ground and Home delivery drivers are honest & good but plenty of bad apples. Fish rots from the head. Nuff said.,0,1

They replied within 24 hours, April 15th, stating that my order was shown as cancelled in their system and I would need to contact a Walmart rep. if that was not the case. So, I did. What a waste of time! The rep. said it would arrive on the 19th. I said there was no way that was possible because it had not shipped yet. That was the whole purpose of my inquiry. He began arguing with me restating the delivery date and that he had know way of knowing when it would be tendered to the carrier. LIKE WHAT???? Never even attempted to contact the marketplace seller to find out what the issue was and get it straightened out with the seller on my behalf. Just wanted to argue with me and do nothing to help.

No there are no spots left and I don’t need it tomorrow I need it today and those with a membership should take priority over other online orders.

Each agent kept telling me to wait another week, wait another week, then wait another week. But nobody took any action. Then the last obnoxious jerk I spoke to gave me a completely different story. When I told him I was going to do a credit card chargeback, he just smirked and said ""good luck."" So that is what I did. And that is how I got my refund for an item that Walmart kept for a month which they never refunded me for. I had to do a chargeback to get my refund. Save yourselves the headache and don't do business with them. Don't order from them. Stay away from them. And if they twiddle their thumbs by not refunding you, go to your credit card and do a chargeback on their ass. They are scum, their corporate staff are scum and so are their agents.

Walmart,BLATANT DISRESPECT FOR CUSTOMER'S TIME,"Terrible experience this past weekend at Walmart Superstore, 201 Walton Way, Cedar Park, TX 78613. I had a return within 30 days of purchase. The initial purchase was a request from a store associate who recommended I buy the item and return if there were any issues. After accepting the recommendation of the associate, the product turned out to be defective - appears to be the low quality of the product. I returned to the store and narrated the issue to customer service - was told that based on their policy, my only resort was to hold on to the item - no option for a refund or store credit. Based on their policy, my only resort was to get a replacement and since they had none at the store, drive from one Walmart store to another till I could find one - BLATANT DISRESPECT FOR CUSTOMER'S TIME. I finally accosted a manager onsite (Daniel, a team lead) and relayed the story to him. He asked for the name of the store associate, which I obviously didn't have. Initially, he appeared to help me but then finally repeated the same spill from customer service - drive from store to store till I could find a replacement. Nothing could be done onsite. What kind of a return policy is this? I left their product for them at the location. Now, they have the returned product as well as my money. I'm boycotting Walmart going forward - would rather spend my money and resources at a place that values its customers. The store manager, Michael, wasn't onsite, and I was told to get his contact info from the front of the office location, but that as well was unavailable.

Zero help because the CEO's hate America and are way too greedy and love money more than people. They hire cheap slave labor for their customer service reps from Venezuela and Columbia for Americans to try and communicate with. Customer service rep the other day claimed there are no Americans to talk with, no supervisors and no phone numbers for corporate headquarters. Their customer service rep told me she had never ordered from Walmart so she didn't know what I was talking about. Walmart is anti-Americans and pro money only. They'd rather hire slave labor in Socialist countries like Venezuela who can't solve anything. Over a year of complaining with photos and not one return call about it.",0,1

Also deliveries during the week come down to me at the shippingdock where i personally recieve them.I have told walmart.com several times that I do not want postmates to deliver my items. This is because they deliver sometimes on Sundays and put my items in a bag at the front door on a busy street in the city at a busy street intersection. Items are usually stolen within 10 mins of them taking the picture and leaving. I have a note on my account to not have my items delivered by Postmates. Also sometimes the driver will call and bring it to my house because they see when they get there its closed and people are walking by. Some dont care they drop it and roll. If I wanted Postmates or doordash I could do that myself. I want my items shipped in a package and delivered like any other items I purcahse.

Also found myself getting good values on bike accessories. Pumps, locks etc. Super values on auto accessories like oil for doing your own oil change. I don't but my good friend likes to do his own. LOL.They don't have the bedding quality/values of a Marshalls or TJ Maxx. Area needs much improvement. Kitchen items not bad. Picked up a few serving bowls etc.. good quality. Clothing have found some light summer cotton items in spring for my mother over the years. Food seems focused on cheap vs quality. Saw people with large junk fake juice drinks. It doesn't have to be that way.. Like whole foods and Stew Leonard's they could have a fresh juice section just to encourage healthy eating if nothing else.Would like to see them source more items from many countries including the US in a balanced way since such a big impact on the use of America's shopping influence.

I was on the phone with representatives twice for a while. First time they told me the groceries had been delivered to wring house and I was out of luck because delivery stopped at 8pm. Then after I complained and got transferrred to a supervisor they told me that it had not been delivered and they would get someone else to deliver. At 9pm I got a text that groceries were delivered. The house photo was the wrong house. We went outside to see if maybe the groceries were there. No such luck. Another call to Walmart support. Again, no deliveries after 8pm was what I was told. The incompetence of the Tanger store International Drive in North Charleston is incomprehensible to me. I will not order again for an evening delivery as that is when all the problems seem to happen.

So sad that a huge company like Walmart could give their customers false hopes of receiving orders in a timely manner when they know in advance that it will take longer. And yes, that is what I found out as the app said I’d receive it today but the email that was sent from Walmart said a later date.

I do not like this feature. Now my things are broken up and I have a person come over when it is very inconvenient for me. Now I have no clue when this random person will arrive with my item. That’s right ONE item. They decide to ship from store and ship everything else from the warehouse. This is a personal item too. Since this whole thing is ridiculous to me I wanted to cancel this ONE personal item. I’m not allowed to. Four hours later. Really, they couldn’t just pack it with everything else from the warehouse? Please allow customers to OPT out of this feature. I would rather be able to say NO to having random people drop things off from the store. Especially when it’s so personal. How awkward for everyone.

Walmart,"Seriously, Walmart?","We are a local business and often order from Walmart to stock our office. We have been ordering regularly for about 3 years now but recently have had some difficulties with the current delivery driver from our nearby Walmart. The first incident occurred last month (Order #3412181-591631). The delivery driver left our entire order on our sidewalk where it was stolen overnight. A nearby office saw the incident and let us know the very next day. They also stated that they had tried to speak with the delivery driver and let her know that she could not simply leave our order on the street or it would be stolen. This is exactly what happened. Fortunately, I was able to take care of that order by speaking with a rep from Walmart and they were able to get the replacement order delivered during office hours the same day. For clarification, we have a notice on our Walmart account that items must be delivered during office hours. These hours are also posted on our door. Unfortunately, we had a second incident last night with another order and I'm assuming the same delivery lady. This time the order was attempted to be delivered again after office hours. Luckily, the delivery driver did not leave the items on our sidewalk this time, however, she did leave a very snarky voicemail on our answering machine about no one being at the office. We close at 5 PM and she states in the voicemail that she was here at 6:12 PM to deliver. We can not keep going through this with our orders. We certainly appreciate Walmart's services but this is absolutely ridiculous that this keeps occurring and there seems to be no way for us to report the delivery person who keeps making these obnoxious delivery attempts.",0,1

ENOUGH FOR ME TO WANT TO SUE THE SHHHT OUT OF WALMART. i do not want my personal care items handled in such an unsanitary and haphazard fashion. Plus, this is Oregon, where the little thin plastic grocery bags are illegal, and yet Walmart drops some of my stuff off in them, while the contents are spilling out on the ground or doorstep and just left there. Until recently, our items ordered at walmart.com were packaged properly for shipping. But it appears this stupid company thinks they can compete with Amazon in being faster, so they use some unknown local average or homeless people to deliver them in their possibly contaminated cars. And are doing a shabby job of it. Yes, some people who live in thier cars, deliver locally to make money. Yes, some people with dogs in the backseat, use that same backseat to carry your unpackaged laundry detergent or etc. Well walmart, you lose,because this just is such a horrendous turnoff, it is done so badly, that I FOR ONE, AM GOING TO TURN TO AMAZON FOR THESE THINGS. because they have far more class, and actually package everything and ship as expected, instead of using cheap crappy unsanitary methods. Even thier timed Fresh grocery delivry, though delivered by local people, is still sealed into paper grocery bags with a sticker seal. At least that! it helps to protect the personal use product OF COURSE! and since we are expecting it at a certain time slot, we are going to be there to accept it right away. They send the regular Amazon online ordered products, NOt the timed ones, in regular shipping packages AS WALMART ALSO SHOULD DO. since i am not talking about the grocery delivery from walmart that also has timed delivery. ( that also should be packaged better as well, it's also shoddy!) I AM JUST TALKING ABOUT THE WALMART.COM ordered items, THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TREATED LIKE MAIL ORDER UNTIL NOW.

I proceeded to tell her what my issue was and at that time she said that customer service is closed. So I asked her if I could talk to a manager, she told me she does not know how to paige anyone. Now if you work there, how do you not know how to use the intercom system. Anyway, I told her that she needs to find a way to get me a manager and she proceeded to hang up on me. So I called again and asked for a manager and again got hung up on. At this time I am really pissed and the proceeded to call again and no answer. I finally just went back out there with my purchase and was finally able to talk to a manager and I got an exchange and told them they needed to check their freezer because the rest of the ice cream in that particular freezer were really soft.

You just lost me as a customer, Walmart. If you can take such a cavalier attitude toward your customers' safety, I don't need to shop there. Ever.",0,2

Walmart,10 years and Still Counting.,"I've been a Walmart customer for nearly 10 yrs. or so. They sure do ship lots of different merchandise. Sometimes reviews of others show signs of great frustration. I've had my share of calls for returns and mistakes. Never but never has any customer service person not been understanding. After at least a decade or longer I can attest this is my go to store for all types of needs. It is rare that I can't find what I'm looking for at the Walmart website. They do huge volume & if only half of 1% goes awry well that still would apply to lots of orders. Then look at all the other perfect deliveries. WOW!! Buddy, my puppy says thanks for his packages too.This company is placing their consumers first. What consumers need as I once did > is patience. Many a mishap wouldn't be Walmart's fault since so many persons are in the system to get our orders to us with as much utmost care as possible. I think if complainers would be pleasant at inconvenient moments Walmart reps. would always respond favorably. If that turns out as not the case, there are supervisors who'd help. What would we do without those important deliveries Walmart makes for us? When most items come in one or two days and with a minimum order shipping is free, we all should thank this company for the support they give. I personally have had reasons to call as stated earlier but with sincere honesty and patience I've never met a customer service person without understanding. How's that for over a decade of nearly monthly buying? Walmart stay well and fair. We need you. Thanks for being there. Florence Ross, Toms River, New Jersey.",0,5

I got a notification when I opened my email that said my order would be here on a particular day. I checked my mail and front porch a few times before it was time for me to go to bed and nothing. I decided to go back to the email and the notification was gone.. poof. So the next day I had another notification saying it would arrive in 2 days, like seriously....

Walmart,I should have read the reviews prior to…,"I should have read the reviews prior to ordering from Walmart. Please see all the poor reviews from other customers before using Walmart. We; a struggling restaurant in NYC trying to reopen for easter, ordered a tent for outside dining a month ago. We were told that that shipment would be within 3-4 days giving us 3 weeks to prepare. We kept being notified by FedEx that our order was delayed and gave us a new delivery date; this went on for 6 days. Finally we got notified it was delivered! Very happy but only to find out that it was delivered back to the company Aosom. When I spoke to Aosom they blamed us for not be available but ever one did FedEx leave a note ""tried to deliver"". We got notified that is was delayed. Aosom did resend but now without tracking numbers. A box here and there were delivered but we are still missing 2 boxes; again returned to Aosom. Told them what we had to open for Easter and our guests wanted to sit outside. Corporate response ""due to the pandemic.....blah blah blah"". Long story short they made no attempt in trying to make it right. We were just issued a refund that I did not want, I wanted the 2 remaining boxes so we could open for Easter. Contacted Walmart Online Customer Service and spoke to Victoria. Explained the situation and then was told there was nothing they could do with a corporate tone. Victoria forgot who the customer was and that we choose Walmart Online to make this purchase. During the call I was put in my place multiple times because she was not listening to my frustration and my experience. At one point Victoria jumped down my throat and said ""I am sorry, did you not ask me a question"" because she told me this was resolved when it was not. When I explained to her what were going through and our business depended on Walmart coming through with our order, she just apologized and said you were issued a refund. How do I tell my guests this now. When I asked to speak to someone more senior, Victoria stated ""She was the most senior person"" in the company and there was no one else. She offered to help find a replacement tent that could be delivered in 2 days, within 30 seconds she said nothing was available. Walmart has no control on who is on the their Market Place. Such a great company it was once, now it is filled with cold hearted people speaking basic corporate language. Even Victoria's apology was robotic and insincere.I also spent 30 minutes trying to contact the corporate office but no one was willing or able to provide a phone number.I will ever trust Walmart ever again.",0,1
Walmart,DO NOT BUY ITEMS FROM THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS ON THIS WEBSITE,"I ordered an item that came from a third party Homesquare/Cymax through the Walmart website. It was not what I wanted so I asked to return it. Third party items over $150.00 cannot be returned to Walmart but must go to the supplier directly and all communication is with the supplier as well. They offered me a $50.00 discount if I would keep the item which I declined. The item was returned which was confirmed by my tracking number. I heard nothing so I contacted the third party who basically denied that they had received the item. I then contacted Walmart customer service who did help by forcing the third party company Homesquare/Cymax to get in touch with me. They sent me an email saying they would send me the money but it may take TWO MONTHS.Totally unacceptable, on all levels particularly when most other online companies offer quick refunds and free returns.",0,1
Walmart,3 out of 3 online orders are marked as…,"3 out of 3 online orders are marked as ""delivered"" but my orders are VERY wrong. Just one order for example: A quantity of ""10"" was ordered, and the delivery driver confirmed ""10"" were delivered, but the photo clearly shows ""2"" were delivered. So, there are two possibilities: 1) the delivery driver doesn't know how to confirm orders as correct or, 2) the delivery driver is stealing my orders. Either one, whether an honest mistake or not, should disqualify them from the job. This sort of thing has happened THREE TIMES IN A ROW. And my orders aren't just a little but short, they are MOSTLY short. And....to top it off...here's the kicker...contacting customer service is USELESS. They had no idea how to help me, and/or didn't even understand the problem, and/or why I should be upset. I call the store, and no solution except a refund is offered. I don't want a refund. I don't need a refund. I need the items I ordered, and that were marked incorrectly THREE TIMES, as ""delivered.""Here's the deal. The last time I shopped at Walmart was 2011. I wasn't happy with their service then, and my recent experience has shown me that it's gotten even worse, if that's even possible. Additionally, my orders from walmart.com (non-grocery) are getting improperly fulfilled through their grocery delivery. I never asked for these orders to be fulfilled through grocery delivery; I expected my orders from walmart.com to be delivered the reliable way - through FedEx or UPS. But no, they had to go and ""improve"" things.I will probably never shop at Walmart or walmart.com again. I'm cancelling them from my life, because it's been pure hassle.

Walmart,Kinda my new fave for online shopping,Gotta say that recently Walmart has been excellent for me with online orders. Even their website is a little better but still could use a total overhaul in my opinion. I use them more than Amazon now because they offer free Fed Ex pick up for returns and they are always reliable as opposed to UPS. The Drew Barrymore home collection is really good too -they are really trying to update their style it seems. Would I set foot in a Walmart store ? Nooooo. Online with them is where it’s at. I shop groceries with them on Instacart and their prices are the best and stuff is always in stock. I’m impressed.,0,5
Walmart,Company Controlled by Heartlessly Elitist Capitalism,"Walmart is another heartless company owned by rich plus powerful people who treat employees like peasants with poor employee ""benefits"" such as unlivable wages that make some of them rely on welfare government money. Also, shipping trucks always move very fast to bring products into Walmart's warehouse that causes broken crackers, broken cookies, etc. It's why I always buy one extra box of crackers in case of making food for parties. Cooking equipment from Walmart breaks a lot more easily than in the past decades ago. Which is why I don't buy cookware here anymore. Electronics don't last long here very much compared to many years ago. Hence, I buy some electronics elsewhere. Clothes are made with very poor quality material now in Walmart's shop versus what happened in very early 2000's. So, I try not to get clothes here. Everything about Walmart has become a joke except for its foods, some electronics, cleaning products, and a few other things. My childhood was spent happily buying electronics, foods, clothes, and other necessities here while experiencing nice employees. But, I've noticed it has changed for the worst since employees in it are treated unkindly and unfairly. Just experiencing Walmart staff behave like they are disillusioned, cynical, depressed, impatient, and other things don't impress me one bit.",0,1

It had one speaker inside - and it was used, either someone else's returned item or a display; the package was not factory sealed and the bottom of the speaker was dirty and had abrasions.Was it the underpaid fulfillment center worker possibly deciding ""one for you, one for me"" and slipping it into their pocket in order to supplement their meager wages? We'll never know.Of course I'll never shop at Walmart.com ever again - WHAT WAS I THINKING?

I again checked on March 11, 2021 to see where my package was and it stated that same thing as check back latter for status update. Therefore, I spoke with a Customer Service Representative on March 11, 2021 to cancel my order. On March 12, 2021, the following day, it stated my package had been delivered. I have never received this package and have spoke with Genesis on March 19, 2021 at 9:22 a.m. and was told by her that the company stated they would refund my money back to my account for the balance of the vacuum cleaner. It has never been done. I called again on yesterday, March 30, 2021 to inquire about my refund for the vacuum cleaner. I spoke with Marianne and she said their system was down and to call back. However, I felt she was no help. At the time I ordered this vacuum cleaner, I was in dire need of it as I was ill and could not go to the store to buy one. I can say that after my conversation with Genesis on March 19, 2021, my account was refunded the 2 year service warranty as I never received this package. This is my first experience with Walmart.com and I do not plan to order online through them again.

However, recently I ordered an album for my sister living in another province in Canada and the album never arrived despite us receiving an email saying it had.

My second phone call I was told my call would be forwarded to someone else to deal with it, which it was. That next person told me they'd then get in contact with another person who was I guess higher up who would deal with it and that I should expect an email in a week. Over a week passed and I received no email. I called back, I was put on hold and, again, after waiting a while my call was dropped. I called back after it was dropped, quite irritated at this point, and got a kind lady who again told me she would contact this other person who would deal with it and I should expect an email in a week. I explained to her that that's what I was told last time and she told me she'd put it as a high priority. Finally, I've gotten a refund for the album but the headache was too much for all of this.

Walmart,Walmart delivery sucks,Ok lets start by saying the walmart delivery service and walmart.com is trash. I spent 1400 on items. 1 of which being a TV. First they said delivery was April 1st then March 31st ok cool still a week for a delivery. So I've been tracking the shipping it had 4 updates on Wednesday March 24th and nothing since then I called Friday March 26th they said it will still be here on time ok. I check today Sunday March 28th and still no updates so I call the shipping company pilot and they still don't have my TV ok so I call walmart again and they said ohh it's a warehouse issue they are delayed cause of the manufacturer. I said how is it delayed cause of the manufacturer if your selling the item? She goes quiet issued me a huge 10% discount on the TV. Which is ok but at the rate of my inconvenience and frustration that I'm not gonna use walmart anymore for online purchases . Also my two 150 headsets were just left on my porch and not 1 knock or doorbell rung also not acceptable. Walmart better step up there delivery game cause Amazon is killing them. I get most of not all my Amazon orders in 24-48 hours usually in my mailbox or they bring the boxes to my side door so less likely to be seen and usually knock once or twice.

Walmart,Walmart.com compares favorably to Amazon.com IMO,"Most of this review is about the experience of shopping Walmart's online store via their app and getting most things delivered. I switched to shopping Walmart.com after a horrendous experience with Amazon, and have been pleasantly surprised.Firstly is Walmart's sensible policy that honors gift cards on their own, without requiring that you give them a credit card number just to use your gift card. +1 Walmart, -1 Amazon.Next is their generous returns/refund policy, which can be taken advantage of either by dropping off the package at FedEx with a QR code (my preferred method), or taking the package to the customer service counter at a physical Walmart store (beware with this option, though, as not all their employees seem to be familiar with how to perform returns bought through the online store).Next is the product selection I've found. I didn't expect to find much on the app that wasn't already available in-store, but wow, I was wrong. They have more products available online-only than they do in the stores. Exotic products, rare products, odd and hard-to-find products shipped from far, far away. Delightful selection!Finally, I've been happy to experience same-day home delivery of some of my orders that were available in-store. Walmart has utilized the local DoorDash-ers to bring select orders to my door the same day I placed them. (I didn't know they did this so the first time it happened, I thought the DoorDasher was making a mistake.)All in all, positive experiences with this company's online offerings -- shopping from home with Walmart is quite a different experience from shopping inside their stores. It's like Amazon, but with better policies.",0,5

However soon after the orders were replaced my account was closed, when I contacted walmart for a reason I was told I had too many returns. I explained to them I did not have ANY returns but my orders were replaced because USPS delivered my items to MIAMI FL instead of Doral, I gave them all the order numbers and all the tracking numbers (which the agents did track) I spoke to 5 agents and 2 supervisors who were all able to see the information.

Amazon and eBay will support the customer when they encounter a bad seller, Walmart does not and most of their online presence is third-party sellers. I made an unfortunate purchase from Walmart.com and the item broke in less than 30 days. When I tried to return it Walmart said I had to go through the seller. I reached out to the seller (Bingo) several times and it took them 3 weeks of being pestered before they responded. The seller's response was that it was past 30 days and they had no responsibility to correct the situation. It was only past 30 days because they delayed in responding in a timely manner. Walmart did nothing to help correct the situation.",0,1

The people at my nearest store use the excuse that the deliverers are from an outside company and if they don't come, they have to reschedule the delivery, but unless someone calls, they don't keep track of that. Along with that, I've had these ridiculous deliveries left on my porch at 11:30 at night. Pathetic. My last product they sent to the store to deliver, isn't even carried in a Walmart store!",0,1

No registers were open for anyone to check customers out. I went to customer service to ask about opening a register so we could get our items. They said they didn’t have one employee in the entire store that could run a register. I will not use self checkout. One employee runs multiple registers taking jobs from American workers. Walmart does not reduce the price of merchandise for me to do someone else’s job. When Sam Walton was alive it was Walmart policy to open another register if more than three people were in one line. Made in America was also a staple at Walmart. Walmart continuously provides poor customer service.",0,1

Walmart,There's as many scam sellers and fake goods on walmart.com as there is on ebay only WITHOUT the guarantee of useful buyer protection that WILL get you your money back... BEWARE,"Theres As many scam sellers and fake goods here on walmart.com as on ebay only with NO *REAL* buyer protection on Wal-Mart.comTake usb flash drives for instance. 2 legitimate name brands then hundreds of listings for identical fakes that are a fraction of listed capacity.Taking the risk would be fine if it was Amazon or ebay with returns of such items being covered and refunds guaranteed. Wal-Mart.com return policy however, only vaguely and deceptively says most return shipping fees are covered (they most certainly ARE NOT. no scam seller is going to offer covered return shipping and there's THOUSANDS of listings from them) but to check with each seller. ONLY there's NO way to contact a seller until AFTER you already buy the item.So you get your terabyte flash drive delivered only to find out that its ACTUALLY a 32 gb drive with a false stamp or print saying ""2 TB"" and with the internal info set to show that capacity is 2 tb when you plug it in. It will let you add all those files as if it's working while in reality it's actually ""writing"" to space that isnt there so you end up with a drive full of 32 gigabytes of corrupted data. If you were cautious, you copied files onto it instead of cut and paste otherwise those files are permanently gone. Now that you bought an item you can finally contact the seller about return info only to learn that return shipping isn't covered and costs more than the item you want to return because they want you to ship the product to CHINA to be returned. In other words thanks for the money, enjoy your fake product, and have fun with your lost data.This is the same type of Chinese counterfeit as the fake name brand sd cards that plague ebay and newegg that also read in your devices that they are correct capacity when in reality they are a fraction of that and the card is simply programmed to falsely list capacity to your device. At least on ebay and Amazon you TRULY are protected if you come across this and get all purchase related costs including shipping refunded to you, while Walmart will just stick you with the cost and assume zero responsibility for allowing hundreds of scammer merchants and thousands of fake goods sold by third parties under the name of walmarts website. As far as I'm concerned Wal-Mart is just as complicit because they know it's happening, are also profitting from such sales, are vague about relevant policy details, and only allow you to check with sellers to try to get return policy details AFTER youve already been ripped off, and are doing NOTHING to stop it or protect the consumers. It's funny and interesting that the disclaimer that ""walmart hasnt verified the product info"" ONLY appear on listings that contain these fake knockoffs. That disclaimer is nowhere to be found on the listings of reputable sellers. Keep telling yourself that Wal-Mart doesn't suspect or see red flags but let it continue anyway.If its looks too good to be true it probably is one of these scams but you're better off not even doing business on Wal-Mart.com until they offer some legitimate form of protection for fake goods and begin actively screening for sales of fakes and create an environment that penalizes and makes it unprofitable to sell fake goods like many OTHER websites have done.",0,1

Was suggested to call the number on the back of my card. Now I'm sure you know, most companies are prompting you to go on their website (chances of you talking to damn human is slim)! So after several calls to walmart as well as my cardholder...here it is Wednesday and still nothing!!! This happened on Sat. WAS a faithful customer!!!",0,1
Walmart,Refunds for online orders is a Nightmare.,"I ordered a set of king size sheets online, according to the site returns were easy just use the order number, I received the sheets but the color was not a match so I returned them unopened, only the shipping package was opened, I had paid with a debit cash card but was not refunded, I was told that it was a third party vendor I had gotten the sheets from and as soon as they received them I would be refunded, after two days or 48 hours,after 2 days, I contacted fedex because I could not track the return with the number Walmart provided, per fedex that number was no good, so I contacted Lanie a representative with Walmart, she did not reply when I told her the tracking number was no good, she just explained again about the third party vendor issue, she claimed she started an escalated ticket to them and I would be refunded by Monday, I was not refunded so I called back and got Sara, I later found out that was a lie,when I asked if her name was Sara because she said it so fast when she answered, I even spelled it, she said yes, come to find out her name is Susie so she even lied about that, she did not care at all or want to help me, she finally tried contacting the third party and they hung up on her, she told me I would just have to wait another 48 hours so now 6 days to be refunded, I still have not been refunded and can not contact the third party vendor and get no real help from Walmart, I would caution anyone from buying online from them unless you don't care if they take your money and give you the finger for it.",0,1

Since December until today, I have spoken with 5 different people and they cannot give me a reason why I have not received my refund yet.

The store was not busy. I found the ROKU ,but it was locked inside the cabinet. So, I looked around for help. There was nobody at the Entertainment Center. I was looking for a buzzer, a bell or a phone to call but none exist. Finally, there was an employee passed by and mentioned that I want to buy a. ROKU. She looked around and found the guy assigned to work at the Entertainment Center and she told me that he is coming. Few minutes later, I the guy come and told him that I want to by a ROKU. Then. another employee (a woman) came and talked to the guy. The guy opened one of the locked cabinets for her and started scanning prices for IPAD. I was there FIRST, should the guy entertain me FIRST, as a CUSTOMER? Then another employee ( a woman) came. She looked at me and ignored me. THREE Walmart employees and by myself (a customer). There was NO OTHER CUSTOMER but me. I was there standing and WAITING, WAITING and WAITING. The guy never had a courtesy to to me that it may take minutes (even I told him that I want a ROKU which should be quick as I know what I want).Much worse, the other two employees never bothered to ask me if I need help. Is it because I look different from them? Is it because I am an ASIAN? Avoid going to this store!!!",0,1

Walmart,My Experience with Walmart recently,This is my honest and sincerest review that I have to tell what I experienced with my service using Walmart online. I think it's done a great job for me. I honestly don't think that it's always Walmart services that are wrong it's the people they have hired that get things wrong. I have always mostly have had good help and great service with the company. I recently shop online and delivery for food and it's the best ever for what we are going through in these rough times. I don't know how I could survive without them as I don't have any transportation and they will bring you whatever you want as long as they have it available and if they don't have it available they do what they can to replace it with another item similar without charging higher price. I love their service. I know we are dealing with people not robots so be Thankful that they offer these services because I do think Walmart wants to please their customers and when they don't it's usually the person you are dealing with not the company itself.This is my best review of my experiences with Walmart for several months now.,0,5

While still checking out i noticed a hole in the dog food she snapped and pointed to my daughter to go get one . I thought thats what they had runners for . So as it sits now i am not sure about the customer service . Thank you again Lisa",0,2

Walmart,Computer Crash Money missing nearly 2…,"Computer Crash Money missing nearly 2 wksOn Sunday Feb 14th I ordered groceries to be delivered to my apartment since I don't have a car and the snow was coming down heavily! I am retired and living on Social security which is not nearly enough! I needed some things delivered well Mondays promised delivery time came and went and a couple of hours went by and I received a call from the Driver who told me that my order was delayed but the computer was down but I should still receive it well a few hours later I called her back and she said that all morning deliveries were being cancelled still no notifications from Walmart themselves but I wasn't too concerned I had enough money on hand to take care of reordering. I chose to go ahead and reorder which was a mistake the computer deleted just enough from my order to disguise the delivery fee which I as a Walmart+ member should not have to pay so I went ahead and placed my order and it was Delivered a few minutes late on Tuesday well I immediately noticed my Items were missing so I looked at my bill which showed those Items weren't on the bill and I called Walmart and asked for a refund of my delivery charge(Big Mistake) instead of processing the refund of my delivery Fee the accounts department charged everything but the delivery charge again and didn't cancel the original charge well my checking account was now in the red only $0.97 but I was now Owed double the amount of money From Walmart and I call again well I tried to explain the problem but nobody took it seriously and it was Not bad trying to get that money back it only took till Saturday although I am a little miffed with my bank since they are no longer showing the bad transactions which Walmart made to bounce my account fortunately I have bounce protection but what business does Walmart have double charging anyone for an order because they asked for a delivery fee return? Thursday I got my $4.95Then on Saturday I get the money back that they erroneously held on my account Since Wednesday Yeah but it is now 4 Days into the recovery from the computer glitch my Order From Sunday is still not cancelled for it is still listed as preparing in the App, on my phone and I call again this Time I am trying very hard to hold my temper but I did get to talk to a supervisor and I got an email stating that my refund would be in my account in 1 to 2 business days I had not noticed this promise but I was relieved that some progress or so I thought was happening Every day one of the 1st things I do is check my checking account to see if my money has been returned and every day I have been disappointed. Today February 24th I get out my E-mail to find my order number and I noticed the words that I had missed before 1 to 2 billing cycles well that means 1 to 2 business days it has been 4 billing cycles I call and once again I talk to another mealy mouthed individual and I am once again put off with the explanation that they are having a hard time getting the refunds processed and that he has escalated this issue I await my refund with baited breath but I will not hold my breath Sunday it will have been 2 weeks since they took my money and I am extremely tired of the BS I have put up with from the customer service people. I will update this post in 2 business days sooner if my money is returned by Saturday!",0,1

Thus complaints are not taken seriously and all customer service does is humor you. Ie.. we're sorry we're working on it, etc. NOT! Don't waste your time on a complaint. Believe me it will go nowhere. At least half the items you choose stay out of stock and more aren't even offered. You wind up making a trip anyway to purchase unavailable items which make the cost of delivery and concept supervelous. Seems the only complaints they are concerned with are liability suits. Why aren't their sales executives concerned? Because they are fat and happy drawing their 6 an 7 figures and more concerned with their stock portfolio's. They need more direct competition to get off their lazy a*****!",0,1

Walmart,Waste of My Time,"I had went online to do a pick you for Walmart when I seen that the core water 24 pk was on sale for $1.48. I did place an order at 1 of the Walmart that said they had some. Within 2 hours they said they cancel my order because they couldn't fulfill the items. I was okay with that and I went and found another Walmart about 30 miles from where I live to place an order. They said they have the items in stock. So, I had place an order for 10 of the 24 pack of Core water for $1.48 per pack. This was on 2/22/21 for the Walmart (845 Durbin Pavillon Dr, St. Johns, Fl 32259). So, I had waited patiently for them to let me know that my order was ready for pick up. Wow, this is a great deal and people was grabbing this item so fast. I can see that they was getting my item ready for me to pick up and they sent me a message on the 2/23/21 in the Walmart app ready for pick up. I had drove almost 30 miles to get to the store (26 miles to be precise). I had checked in to let them know that I was on my way. Then when I got there to let them know that I was outside a guy was there and ask me for my name. I told him my name and he went back in to get the items (that's what I thought). Another man came out with bags and the first guy and 2 other guys was stand back in the distance watching. I had asked the guy who came out with the bags where are my cases of water. He going to tell me something about Corp. mess up with the pricing and they don't sell Core water 24 pk. Do I still want the single water for $1.48 ea because that's what they cost anyway? I told him No and I want my money back. It's makes me so upset because he lied for 1, they do sell the Core water 24 pk. 2 They should honor the price because that's what it said and I had order it before they correct it. 3 They should have cancel my order but instead they have me come for 10 single water instead of 10 24 pack of water. This Walmart makes me loss all respect for Walmart. I would have been happy if they just cancel the order and said they couldn't fulfill the items. They knew that they was wrong because the other 3 guys was watching. I was so upset because this Walmart wasted my time. I will be letting everybody know that Walmart doesn't stand by their price. I will be letting everyone know that they should be shopping with Amazon because at least they honor the price that they sell the item for. I will not be shopping with Walmart no more this was a bad experience. I can't see myself giving my money to someone who try people like a fool. They tell lies to my face and don't honor the price.",0,1
Walmart,Making up policies that do not exist,"I went to the Walmart on Saviers Road in Oxnard, CA. I tried to return some Valentine's Day items that my children were unable to give their teacher's. I have a receipt that shows the items were purchased less than 30 days ago but the girl at customer service and the Manager would not return these items. The manager said it is the policy but she is lying because there is no such policy! They have nothing posted at any of their stores, if you look online their policy does not state any time frame you are allowed to return seasonal items and the lady at the corporate office could not find anything saying that was their policy. I was told that it is up to the Manager which it not okay because not only is this not in their policy now I have to hope the Manager is in a good mood to allow a return. Walmart does not lose any money, they are insured. If anything I the consumer am at a loss because I can't make a return of items that I purchased less than 30 days ago even though I have proof of purchase and there is no such policy saying that seasonal items can't be returned after a certain time period. Seems like Wal-Mart needs to get their policies in place and stop making them up as they go. I am currently waiting for a response form their corporate. Let's see if they respond.",0,1

As far as I can tell the oil change is fine, however my car has an oil pan shield that is held in place by 6 quarter turn screws and two screws in the front. Thinking I could trust Walmart's automotive services I didn't think to crawl under my car to double check that they put the screws in properly after they were finished. Well 18 days later, I am driving down the road and all of a sudden I start to notice a loud scratching noise under my car, low and behold all but two of the quarter turn screws have fallen out and my shield is folded in half. Walmart was the last service/people to be under my car and I have not bottomed out my car on anything. Over the last 2 years I have changed my oil 11 times myself and have never had this issue, take it to Walmart once and now I have to fork out an extra $60+ to replace my shield and the screws that hold it in place.

I live in GA, the package was in GA 45 min away....Granted Walmart is using Fed Ex, but it is still a reflection on Walmart, particularly when the service agent lied that it was weather, then he guaranteed me that my package would be here the next day (today) the 21st. Once again, my son has been looking out of the window all day, anxiously awaiting the ""guaranteed"" package. Around 5:15pm, I checked the tracking. It still said it would arrive by the end of the day. About 10 min later, it said the package has been delayed until tomorrow. The package is located 10 min from me. I don't know where to complain.

However, again, she called when she arrived and had me meet her downstairs. Everything was perfect besides, they'd messed up on the order. I figured that happens and I just let them know... When I contacted customer service, they couldn't help, twice. They forced me to place the order again and had me wait for 2 days before the delivery. They claimed management would contact me. I haven't heard from management. None of my orders have come complete as ordered. NONE...most of my requests did not have replacements, and, after the first delivery, the ones that had replacements were unacceptable. Then, 2/16/2021 upon my previous orders I began to notice that all of my deliverers have been African American through food stamps. All of them. I began to think about it. I felt like someone was aware of the complaint, however, I said nothing. I know that someone could comprehend my thoughts as when almost every other delivery person through food stamps was dark skin or African, and did most everything perfect... called when they arrived, waited for me downstairs, and gave me all that was available; The first caucasian American out of the food stamp delivery walks in the hotel, walks right past hotel security up the elevator, and knocks on my door during the pandemic emergency, in a hotel full of homeless.

Walmart,Terrible and extremely unprofessional customer service experience with Grocery Pick up!,"I always do grocery pick up. Never had a problem until today. I placed my order Saturday and scheduled it for pick up today between 10-11am to pick up at the Atlantic & Kernan Wal-mart. Received all of my usual updates, alerts, etc. Only to get there and be told that all orders between 10-11 were canceled because their system crashed at 7am. I am like this order was placed Saturday the 13th and it is now Monday the 15th! So I ask what they can do about this? He sends out the manager who basically much tells me there is nothing she can do and it is not her fault the system crashed (which I completely understand) said she has 200 other people to call and cannot do anything to help me & that I should of already been refunded and I tell her I have not and I could show her on my phone that money has been taken out and not refunded. She said ""Well lady look the only thing you can do is call Wal-mart.com. I can't do anything to help you & walks away from me. I call Walmart.com and spoke to a representative and that rep told me that she doesn't know why that manager would tell me that because they do not have the tools to re-schedule my order and that they are the one's who are supposed to do that. She was baffled and upset for me. She told me she would call that store and see what she could do to help. Placed me on a brief hold and called the store. When she returned to the phone she told me that they told her the same thing that there was nothing that they can do! That I will just have to wait and re order!! Well I cannot do that until my $400 is returned to my card and that can take 24-48hrs!! I have 3 children to feed and I spent the last bit of money I had on this grocery order. This is absolutely ridiculous, unprofessional, terrible customer service & just plain CRUEL!!! I understand this happened to many people, but it is NOT okay to handle things this way & tell a paying customer, that mind you ALREADY paid for this order 2 says in advance that there is ""nothing that they can do"" I am extremely upset and quite frankly pissed at this establishment & will NOT use this service ever again!!!! I am going to be calling Ken Amaro tomorrow to tell my full story.",0,1

You would think that considering it's Walmart that they would have a top notch user friendly website. BUT NO! One day I will have 300 or so items in my Buy Again List that I have carefully edited so that it only has the items I would like it in...then next thing I know it is populated so that 900 or so items show up! I tediously spend hours removing the items...they leave me alone for a day or so, then they are back.Not only that...I can be on the Frozen Tab and next thing you know it has bounced back to Pantry. It truly has a mind of it's own. Maybe they thing if I am confused I will order more?The obvious thing you say would be to create a list. However the list options does not break things down into categories or allow you to group items. It in and of itself is terrible!I wonder if the people who created this site actually use it? There is no way...if so they would be equally frustrated and annoyed.Please Please Please Walmart....go in and look at your site. You are the world's largest retailer.

When I contacted the customer service line they said ""because the parcel is delivered (which isn't true as I called the store directly and part of the order hasn't arrived yet) we really can't do anything about it.""I called the store directly, was put on hold for over 5mins before the woman told me she was having issues with her system. Walmart is a HUGE company that should have better customer service and systems in place for this kind of issue. The fact that I was dismissed so easily was appalling.

Not one time have I ever gotten an item I ordered & paid for. It wasn't in stock. Why list it if you don't have it? Then, at least 5 days later, they finally refund your money & blame your bank. Totally stupid way of not doing business. Never, never again will I buy from their online sight. Then, customer service is a barely legible person from a non English speaking country trying & failing to help me get my point across. Worst experience & my ignorant self did it 5 times.

Walmart,Stop right there!,"Seems kinda redundant to give a bad review here, but I'd feel remiss if I didn't warn would-be online shoppers about their horrendous service, both before and after they try for the near inevitable refund attempt(s). I ordered a pannier pack for my bicycle that showed a decent looking product in the ad picture. Upon receiving said item, I wasn't sure whether to throw a fit or laugh out loud. The thing was not much bigger than a dollar bill! What a sham! Took the thing to a local Walmart for a return, only to be told to take it to another location! The thing is, is that I wasn't there necessarily for that particular issue; I was there to get a refund for an item I ordered online($20.00) that got DELIVERED to another state! The girl at the counter said they CAN'T resolve those sort of issues there even though there's a computer sitting RIGHT THERE on the 'customer service's counter! Another woman(this time) whom I assumed was the manager of that department overheard this exchange from across the area to chime in with the same thing even though I thoroughly explained that I tried repeatedly getting a refund online but found the website very user unfriendly and intentionally confusing where refunds/returns are concerned.(But for purchasing items the site pretty much took you by the hand) Shop ebay instead! Or even Wish or Amazon. The delivery times are a bit longer but minus all the cartoonish cockups.",0,1

After it happened the second time (all within a week), I said I felt like they should own this and just resend it to me without me having to do all the work. They could not. I also thought they should send for free but their response was to offer to pay the difference in price when I reorder which was less than a dollar. I found the item (much cheaper) somewhere else.

Walmart,Walmart: another bad customer service experience,"Oh boy. Another bad experience at a Walmart. What a surprise. This was in walmart in cottage grove minnesota.

When he went in to return it (with a receipt) he was treated like a criminal. He was told he had to wait until the person that sold him the ring came into work and then he could return it. The classy woman ( I would say lady) claimed that was normal procedure. Well how else could we be sure she said? I'm sorry what?? There is no files on a computer or in there system that shows inventory? Even a place like Walmart has that. They profiled my son because of his appearance. Now in a place that caters to, let's say, certain aspects of society that's pretty surprising. My friends were also at a Walmart in Eden prairie minnesota and profiled. They made a comment to a staff member who was hassling them and she said, I'm a b****? Your mother's a b****! I'm about done with these cesspools. Too many bad experiences.

The seller did not even shipped my item but I am getting a confirmation in my email from Walmart saying that my item was delivered. I am calling to file a complaint and they did even not do anything about, the only way they can help me is saying that they will send me a $10 coupon for my next purchase. What, are you serious Walmart? I paid around $200 for the item and I had oma day of hassle to find my package, when the package was never shipped? And you are offering me $10? Keep your dirty $10 coupon. UNPROFESSIONAL. That’s why AMAZON is beating you. NEVER I will be your customer again.. Way to go AMAZON!!",0,1

Wonder why people are turning to Amazon, because you don't have to deal with rude employees at Walmart. I asked for a shopping cart, young lady standing at the door responded, while leaning up against the wall, with her hands crossed, looking like she didn't want to be there, I don't know I guess their coming, not bothering to check.

I went to store, check with pickup and photos department with my order id. Both don't have any clue about my package. I told them name of the person who received order using Fedex tracking id. They said no one with this name works here. I again contacted customer support, they said we will escalate this to store and store will reply back in 24-36 hrs. No reply from store. I again contacted customer support, they kept me on hold to check with store and replied back, store could not find your order. You can consider this as lost by store. My only concern is, those are printed photos of my daughter and it is delivered to store, it should not be misused somewhere. If it's any other order, I would have cancelled it.

Walmart,Watch Out For Walmart End Cap Pricing,"I went to Collinsville Walmart to shop for a few grocery items. I passed an end cap with cases of Gatorade (sign posted - Everday Low Price $8.96). After getting to the register, Cashier told me that that the price was more than the sign. We went back to the area which showed cases in stacks under the sign. Store Manager, Stock Manager, Cashier, and Stockers were clueless about the stocked items. Everyone were guessing and confused, so they stated it was a stocking/labeling problem but didn’t allow me to purchase the Gatorade for the price on the sign shown. The Cashier, Cashier Manager, In-Store Staff as well as Store Manager who turned her name badge backwards. I asked her name which she informed me it wasn’t important and her name wasn’t needed for a complaint. I have pictures of posted pricing of the items. Even a man that came later to chat while cashier completed the cash out process: problems cashing me out because of various pay methods (unfamiliar with cashing out with various methods). Staff didn’t honor posted sign, 5-6 staff assisted the problem for a $10.00 dollar difference on a $150.00 purchase. It seemed that the problem got personal with staff. (It was only a $10.00 problem that wasn’t handle properly as well as costly on time spent with staff). Watch Out For Walmart’s Posting on Prices!",0,1

A woman employee came into the aisle and saw me holding my eye as it hurt and was watering. She didn't ask if I was ok or if I needed any help. No one did! Now, people look at me as if I was beaten up. One person asked if my b/f did it and told me there are safe places to go. It's so embarrassing!!",0,1
Walmart,Walmart.com Allows You To Buy Products They Don’t Have,"Instead of retyping the whole fiasco, I’ll just share the letter I emailed them. Enjoy...Hello,Yesterday I found this item on Walmart.com. There were 5 available. I purchased all 5, opted for store pick-up, received an order number, etc., then contacted my pre-paid/pre-order customers to let them know that I would have these items for them to pick up today.Problem 1 - This morning, I received an email from you that my entire order was canceled. The explanation given was “high demand.” If these were no longer available, why was there still a quantity available at the time of my purchase? Either Walmart has a lackluster, non-real time supply chain/web integration, or this is something that is allowed to happen by design so that sales can be recorded; either explanation is unacceptable.Problem 2 - I now look like a liar and/or moron to my customers. One of the customers who spends about $50-$75 a week in my store has now been lost because of this. That’s $200-$300/month of lost revenue. That’s not a lot to you, but that’s essentially a car payment to me. I’m certain that this is going to result in poor word-of-mouth and negative online reviews.Problem 3 - I contacted “customer service/support,” in quotes due to reasons you’ll see below. I’m sure you’ll see the problem with your “support” once you see the screenshots.Problem 4 - Locating an email address for you is impossible on your website (almost certainly by design). Google was the only way.Problem 5 - Is there a 5th problem? I guess that depends on your reply.Thank you for your time.",0,1

I never received the product and the status on walmart.com is still showing as (Delayed—check back later for status update). I've been reaching out to Walmart for over 5 months now and am told numerous things - to which I have done per their request. The first thing, contact the 3rd party seller to check to see where my product is. The response from the seller (VM Express) ""I'm so sorry to hear that you haven't received your refund. We're able to see that the refund was processed onto the original form of payment on 07/07/2020. Reaching out to Walmart.com would be the best step from here. They should be able to tell you why your refund hasn't gone through.""I have called, written, and done numerous on-line chats with walmart.com and am STILL without my refund of $136.06. Funny how they can take that charge from my credit card instantly, but a refund is nearly impossible! I was told now (this is my 7th or 8th chat online with someone about this) that I should really just contact my financial institution and dispute the charge. Nice work, Walmart.com for trying to have someone else handle your dirty work. Let's have my financial institution take time (money on staffing) to dispute this charge with you....which I can imagine will get us NOWHERE. Shame on walmart.com for this runaround. I have all conversations saved on my computer and have spent nearly 5 hours trying to get this resolved. My thoughts is that they want me to just ""forget"" about it. Not going to happen!",0,1

Walmart,WORST Walmart in the Entire Nation,"Am retired US Air Force and have been assigned to multiple bases across our nation. At each and every base, have depended on Walmart to provide cost effective services and products in the pursuit of maintaining my vehicles in excellent condition. In doing so, have never experienced any problems until encountering the Walmart at 11400 State Route 99, Everett, WA 98204. Purchased the “lifetime rotation and balancing” package when having tires installed on my car there. Some months later, when it was time to rotate and balance my tires, showed up at this Walmart about three hours before the tire shop closed and they refused to provide service, recommending that I come back another day and even earlier. Came back two days later and four hours before the tire shop closed. Same thing, they refused service. So, came back the next day, again four hours before the tire shop closed, and was refused service for the third time. Fast forward about nine months later and it’s again time to rotate and balance the tires. Arrived at the same Walmart today at 3:15pm, which is 45 minutes before the “be here by 4pm and we guarantee to service your car today” cutoff that they stated via phone, and AGAIN they REFUSED to provide service. This Walmart is totally DETESTABLE in how they take your money when you buy the lifetime service, but then REFUSE to honor their commitment to you. I will NEVER set foot in this particular Walmart again and will tell everyone I know how they refuse to provide the services you pay for. Have never experienced such an awful Walmart before anywhere in the course of my across-the-nation living experiences. This store is despicable!",0,1

Walmart,Way to ruin a Birthday Party Walmart !!!!!,Ordered a Birthday present only reason I ordered from Walmart was they had shipping that insured it would arrive on time. Noticed it immediately created a shipping label and then never changed. Contacted Walmart customer service to check on it. They said it had shipped and would be there on time. Thus at this point I had time to get something else but I waited. Later this afternoon it has updated that it has now actually been picked up and will ship tomorrow. I think I may need to start a class action on this process as its done solely to prevent people from getting a return and they know they are not going to ship on time. I can confirm this by the hundreds online. Time for a reddit and hungry attorney I guess. ARHHHH.,0,1
Walmart,Never buy any products from Walmart…,"Never buy any products from Walmart online especially third party products. Walmart does not give you the customer service support you deserve like other companies such as Amazon. They do not take responsibility as well. It is extremely difficult to understand them (strong Indian accent) and they promise you that they’ll contact the seller to solve the problem, but nothing is ever done. I have asked for the managers contact information (email or phone number) to discuss the issue, but they refused, so there’s this continuous cycle of me contacting customer service that goes on and on. You never know when or how you will be able to get your money or product back. I have ordered a forehead temperature tool from Walmart online, and after over a month of waiting time, I have received a nail polisher instead, not to mention THE PACKAGE WAS ALREADY OPENED AND CLEARLY USED. I did not get my money back nor do my product, and quite honestly I don’t even believe that this was an honest mistake, as that my order is highly in demand and their offer was that I could keep the nail polisher for half the price instead of getting my order.

Walmart,NEVER buy third party products from Walmart - refined scam,"DO not buy, repeat Do not buy third party products from Walmart. They do not have at all customer respect responsibility as AMAZON does. NO COMPARISON with Amazon. Walmart's warranty is limited to 150 dollars. Anything above that - they offer you to contact the seller through their system and you are supposed to be copied on that. The system does not work that way as confirmed by their reps and although the reps promise you to contact the seller they do not take responsibility if he does not answer you - big legal loophole deliberately made by their lawyers. So you can call as many times as you want the Walmart reps (all with Indian accent) and they can promise you to contact the seller and you are not even copied on that (although they promise you to do so) and the circle goes on with confirmation numbers, escalation, supervisors and so on until you give up your money to them. I have my suspicions who benefits from that but I will keep it to myself. I personally lost $225.",0,1

There was another bar code on the box that worked. I went home and got the receipt. I went back and they still refused to take it back and told me to go back to the original store. With the receipt they would not take it. Missing parts and broken they would not take it. I tried to return it the same day it was purchased. I am disappointed in the customer service.

Walmart,Worthwhile only if you use ebt,The only good thing I can say is Walmart delivery accepts ebt payment.

Trying to figure out if a receipt is the updated one is difficult. I've used the service three times and each one has been confusing from requesting refund for missing/incorrect items to providing a proper tip.

Walmart,I HAVE HAD GOOD EXPERIENCES,"The customer service that has been experienced here has been wonderful. The problems that some are having must be location-based. Many bash Walmart due to where many of the goods come from but, where do I go if I really need something? WALMART! The products may not all originate where preferred but I am not a purchasing or regulation expert and am not sure under what circumstances are involved. Another example of me trusting my government to keep me informed if purchasing practices are shaky. Walmart usually has what I need and I will happily grab some of my groceries if I happen to be at a Super Walmart. I have very little experience with their online ordering but it must be trustworthy as many seem to utilize it.They always come through for me!",0,5
Walmart,WORST customer service EVER!!! I was at Walmart,"I was at Walmart, Florissant, MO location on Friday, worst customer service of my life. The culture of the store is suc that they could care less about assisting you in any manner. You basically have to track down employees for assistance and even then they duck you and pass the buck to someone. So I needed a cartridge for my printer, so I proceeded to electronics. Once there, no one was available to assist me, although there was 2 employees behind the counter in full view tapping on their phones. So I got in line for assistance, not to check out. By the time the cashier got to me for assistance, she proceeded to get her coat and purse and leave without ever saying anything to me (I guess her shift was over). Okay, so I’m standing there in disbelief, and the other cashier finishes his last customer and asks me if I needed help, of course he saw what had just happened with my cashier. I said yes and told him I needed a cartridge for my printer as I had the basic user’s guide with the brand and number on it. So he walked me the area and pointed to the cartridge that was compatible with the price under it. By the time I got back to the electronics line to pay for my cartridge, the one cashiers line was long with customers in line with baskets of groceries, not electronics. Now you would have thought that the cashier who left his register to assist me would have walked back to the register to ring me out but no he went to do something else more pressing. So because the line was extremely long with ppl purchasing groceries, I assumed I could get checked out quicker up front in the regular check out/self checkout lines. When I got up front, they only had maybe 3 lines open and they were so long, they were back in the clothing section and same for self checkout. So I went back to electronics to make my purchase since that is what I purchased. While standing there in line to be waited on, one of the employees behind the counter on his phone, proceeded to walk up to cash register to check out someone who was not in line, but just walked up to be waited on and was checked out, He finished ringing him out and stepped back off register and got back on his phone. After all the grocery customers were waited on, it was finally my turn, my cartridge wasn’t the amount it said it was located, it was double, okayyyyy So I purchased it anyway just to be done only to get home, and loaded into my printer. My printer said it needed an additional black cartridge, so of course I’m pissed. So I took it back today to get my money back because it obviously wasn’t compatible and was told they don’t take anything back open when it was your associate who told me that was the cartridge. Worst experience as a customer ever and I will NEVER do business with you all!!! Walmart has made trillions during the Pandemic and this is the type of service they’re giving with no resolution!! Y’all SUCK!! Go somewhere else, Target, dollar store etc!!🤬🤬🤬",0,1

I placed another order that was marked as shipped on Dec. 30, but, again, no tracking updates. I have requested a refund from the seller.

Walmart,Absolutely the WORST purchase,"Absolutely the WORST purchaseIt took WALMART 30 + - Days to get it to me from Mississauga ONT. (Tomnet CA Premium is the Shipper)to Edmonton AB retail pick up location. The Motor is too weak for semi hard spices like All-spice, Cinnamon, pepper corns Dehydrated Avocado seed. Etc. The plastic top is not sealed proof, you can see spice dust leaking from the sides. The Clear Plastic cap gets scratched in the first use, and then it become exceedingly difficult to clean the spice dust in the scratches on the cap without bleach soaking overnight. At best it grinds the spice to a coarse level, not a powder consistency. Ordered Dec 21st 2020, Picked-up 19th January 2021. IF you run this spice grinder trying to get a consistency result, the motor starts smelling like a burning appliance motor. The blades inside have only three teeth's each, the blades are exactly same height (Design flaw) Worst $28 Investment ever bought. It also took Walmart 3 business days to locate it when the website showed it was already in some warehouse of Walmart in Edmonton. Then my order is erased from my account order history. Order number 1508337847434158990091 Tracking Canada Post 2012581019117211 Walmart Sales Order Id: 9182021000454 At the Highest Value I believe this product should be under $10 to the consumer, NOT WORTH the $28 (Clearance price).

While in the store there was a family of 5 who apparently don't care about wearing masks and neither does Walmart I guess. Asked one of the managers about it and they said they don't force them to wear masks and thus aren't supporting the governors mandate to wear them. Either way Costco is not too far away and you can't get into their store without a mask as well as our close by Fry's, Safeway, CVS, Walgreens and every restaurant.

The service was excellent, the products were good (produce), and the prices were exceptional. However, 20 plus years later what an absolute horrible place to shop. The customer service is abhorrent. The people working there are disillusioned, believing snide comments and no clue how to help you is the norm. Trying to return something without a receipt is nearly impossible. The products and food items are poor in quality. Trying to fulfill an online order for pick up proves to be as unsatisfying as having a 10 year old “run to the store” for you.

Walmart,The most Disgusting CSR in Walmart history,"I used to shop at Walmart religiously but in the past year I have slowed down and today will be the last time I will put my hard earned money towards a Company that is so incredibly gross, I was trying to return an item which I assumed they would come up with an excuse as to why they could not return, (this has been the past theme for myself and all surrounding individuals) just as I suspected they told me I had to go through the company that produced the product. Now let’s move on to the more serious issue, as I waited my 25 minutes until my turn I was forced to watch and hear some of the most disgusting language and general wording towards an elderly gentleman that was trying to pick up an order that was late on Walmart’s behalf, until he finally asked if he could get a refund and he would shop the items himself, the refund was granted and then as he asked if the funds was going to be available for him to make his grocery purchase he was told “Um no sir it takes approximately 3 days for your bank to process” at which time he now was a little upset and asked if he could just go and grab the items on the pick up order and then they could finalize the order in the system and she “stated sir you are not an employee of mine correct”? He stated no and “why would I let you shop my store under a pick up order than” be stated so I could purchase my items because other wise I will have to wait for the funds to be available in my account and she replies well I’ve already refunded you so the transaction is done have a good day and walked away from him.

Don’t take out the Walmart+. It’s a waste of your hard earned money since your unable to get half of what you try to order.

Walmart,In the past year,"In the past year, Walmart Plus has managed to deliver my groceries on the first try exactly TWICE. I've ordered about ten times in total. This is what usually happens: 1. The driver never delivers or delivers the wrong groceries. This last time, the driver delivered a box of dog biscuits that were so large, I immediately knew he not only screwed up my apartment number, but also my ENTIRE COMPLEX ADDRESS. No one in my complex is allowed to keep large dogs, and the pet limit is 2. The community is close knit & very pet friendly (we will walk each other's dogs, for example), so we would DEFINITELY notice if someone broke this rule. Also, of course, the driver drops the bags. Don't order eggs or bread. Nothing fragile like that. 2. Walmart support ""reassures"" me that they will call me back to follow up. 3. Meanwhile, I have no food that day. 4. I have no food the next day. And no phone call. 5. No food this day, either. No phone call, either. 6. I call the local store to talk to a rude store manager who informs me that I can do a pickup, but if I don't want to do that, they will refund me ""when they get around to it."" The one time we allowed this wait to happen, we were left waiting for a solid two months only to find out the manager still hadn't even started the refund. Now, we keep calling back until we get an employee that's sympathetic enough to set up a new delivery time. 7. This process repeats almost every time we place an order. We have been informed that the following is true for ALL STORES:- If you check contactless delivery, Walmart is alieved of any responsibility for the delivery. It is up to their sole discretion whether or not they will refund the purchase. This includes cases in which Walmart's drivers mess up and don't deliver or deliver the wrong groceries. Read the fine print. Don't do contactless delivery. Require your signature as proof it was delivered. - If they mess up your delivery, they cannot reschedule until the next day - if you're lucky. Period. - They have no time frame set for refunds being received. They can keep you waiting for them to refund your purchase as long as they want to. It's all left up to the store manager. As far as I can tell, the store managers hate this service and actively sabotage it. Since they're sabotaging it, I'm guessing there are no incentives in it for them. Typical corporate BS. At least Amazon gets their customer service and deliveries right, though....",0,2
Walmart,Nice customer service-terrible training/incorrect information online,"The customer service people (some of them) were nice but my experience was ridiculous. I ordered a tv console and decided a few hours later that it wouldn’t work-we are talking 2-3 hours later. I called to cancel the order-they told me it was cancelled, it wasn’t. One month later I still hadn’t received a refund so I called to ask-they said I had tried to cancel too late and it was still on its way to me (one month later??? That was fed ex’s fault maybe but I’m convinced Walmart had a chance to cancel it) I asked what I could do because I didn’t need it anymore I had bought another one, they said just deny the shipment, I tried but fedex didn’t allow me to. I call again and initiate a return and ask Walmart to pick up the console since it’s over 100 lbs, they said it could only be returned to a store. I do all the paperwork online which again shows my item as only returnable In store, I’m sent an in store return slip and I find someone with a truck to transport the console because it won’t fit in my car and someone to help carry the console to the store-where I’m told they can’t take it back-I have to return by mail. I feel terrible but I made a scene because I was so frustrated with the whole experience-the store manager Carlos was nice but didn’t budge at all and refused to accept the console and the rep who eventually helped me schedule the pick up of my return from my home was nice as well but all this runaround was so unnecessary. We carry the console back to the car and back to my home again where it will be picked up in two days by a courier. Walmart is going to end up spending more on pickup and shipping. They could have just accepted the return in the store like they’d always told me I needed to do and spared me and them the trouble as well. First and last time shopping at Walmart.",0,1

Yesterday, at around 12:00pm I headed to Wal-Mart at Renaissance Square on Berry St. here in Fort Worth TX. I went to pick up a money transfer while it was snowing at 20° temperature. There was also a wind chill factor so needless to say it was uncomfortably cold. The store was packed, which is only what could be expected for a typical Sunday afternoon. Greeters were there as usual with their kind disposition which is the norm. Everything seemed to be running smoothly. I went to Money Services to make my transaction. Service was speedy and efficient. The cashier was clear and easy to understand. She knew her job well. It was snowing so the floors were a little muddy. The most important part of the store, as far as cleanliness goes, the restroom was spotless. The plumbing worked very well also. I will continue to go to Wal-Mart for some needs and wants.

Walmart,We no longer order from Amazon,"We no longer order from Amazon. Our last two orders from Walmart were ""multiple item"" purchases. The competition is terrible at handling this type of on line order. Walmart has it nailed down. The orders had 4-8 items with most of the items coming from their seller/contractors. With in 24 hours you get a email notification providing you the status by item, ""by seller"" by ""date of delivery"" They also give you the original product description and price. if some items have not shipped, they show processing. Your credit card is charged as each item/seller ships. This makes reconciliation your credit card charges and order shipment much easier. I am sure this reduces CC dispute amounts. On return items you can go to your local store even though it was a on line purchase. BUT YOU MUST KEEP AND BRING THE ORDER DETAIL THAT SHOWS WHO THE SELLER WAS. With out that, you have a long wait and testy cashiers. They must look up and figure out who the seller for each return was or they cannot receive the return. BAD PROGRAMMING in their system.

Walmart,Worst online purchase of all times,"I purchased, on Dec 28, 20, 03 ski helmets at walmart.com with delivery schedule for Jan 13, 21.On Jan 5, 21 - received a small package with 3 clown wigs. As I have not ordered such thing, it was not until I checked online that my walmart order was received that I connected.Reached out to Walmart and were told 48 hours to resolve my issue. In less than that, received an email indicating a refund and with the reason: CustChgMind.Reached out to Walmart a 2nd time, besides the ""flat lie"" I want the product I paid for well in advance. I was told to wait another 48 hours. Today (Jan 8, 21) received an email informing to return the items (no address or procedure provided) and informing the items I bought are out of stock.While Walmart is still in the second 48 hours to get back to me, I believe it is safe to say I have been lied to, tricked and the clown wig may have been a hidden message for buying at walmart.comNot a big fan or amazon, however, I have to admit that walmart is making them look pretty good.Walmart, here is the hint - If you sold an item and charged ahead of time for it, least you can do is delivery it. If you fail, don't pass the burden to your customer, go out and fix it.I don't normally post reviews, but in this case I will go all in until I get what I paid for.",0,1

Walmart,Defective merchandise,"I purchased a set of cork backed placemats from the Walmart Marketplace. The placemats started to split after using them for several weeks. When I went to return them to the store, I was told that they had a 30 day return limit which had passed by 13 days. The employee said to call the Walmart customer service for assistance. The two customer service agents that I spoke with (Andrew and someone else) informed me that Walmart does not stand behind the products they sell, but that they would contact the Marketplace seller for return. Andrew then said he would contact the Marketplace seller, but ended up connecting me with the Marketplace Seller where I could only leave a message. This is a very deceitful practice by Walmart to sell something on their website and not display with the item the information that the return policy was different than Walmart's 90 day policy, This information is only visible if you click on the tab adjacent to the picture of the item and not a requirement for the purchase process. Regardless, this product should last longer than 30 days and if defective should be returnable to Walmart.

In Springfield, Ohio don't expect the hazard on your tires to actually be supported. I purchased my tires from that store, they caused they issue, but due to Covid-19 they could not replace the tires. In the meantime, in Missouri, my brother-in-law`s tire was replaced for something that was not Walmart's fault. And, even due to Covid-19 they replaced the tire. I called Corporate & filed a complaint due to rudeness of one person. That individual was empathic & referred my complaints to manager. Received a call back in 2 days with questions & verbal apology. Said nothing can be done except an apology & the most he could do about the 2 tires was to possibly give me free hazard on the tires if replaced by them. The tapes of the incident will be reviewed & the manager will have a discussion with the employee. I called Sam's & they can replace tires. Amazes me other stores can replace tires in other areas, but this store cannot. I would advise you not to purchase tires in Springfield, Ohio & don't expect hazard to be honored.",0,3

Walmart,Walmart South Sioux City Ne  is a joke,"Walmart #1332 is a joke the front end cashiers are rude and lazy . The store is filthy basically because the store manager is more concerned with stuffing his pockets with profits then he is about customer service . and if you do shop at this store be aware that most of the food in grocery is out of date and still on the shelves because the stockers don't rotate the product they just throw it up on the shelves resulting in the fresh product being sold before the older product so by the time you reach the back most of it is expired. and still sitting on the shelves for sale .I bought a London broil from meat and produce that looked fresh on top when I got it home I removed it from the package and it was all brown patches underneath and smelled rotten- but the date on it said it was fresh, This store is literally a mess ,And as for the self check outs most of the time they freeze up on you while you are trying to checkout and you end up waiting for 10 minutes for a cashier to help you while they are busy standing over in a corner chatting and pretending they don't see you , not that it matters most of them are at cards only which means no cash and if you are lucky enough to find a self check out that takes cash most of the time it will freeze up and not give you back your change,I will be taken my business elsewhere .Walmart is just basically a dump",0,1

Walmart,My name is William Lipps and this email…,"My name is William Lipps and this email is in reference to my experience with order number 6212XXX-XXXXXX. I will start by saying that I hope this is actually read by Mr. McMillon so that maybe someone from Walmart can put themselves in my shoes to understand how pathetic this buying experience has been. I have NEVER been treated so poorly as a customer and never spoken to so many supervisors/managers that showed ZERO empathy or responsibility. Over TEN supervisors or managers and NOBODY, I repeat NOBODY has been able to come up with a resolution to the problem. If this does not get resolved I will be sure to contact the BBB, write reviews on all social media platforms, and may even contact the local news as I am sure others would like to see how awful this experience has been.As I am sure you know, Playstation 5's are not readily available to purchase and are near impossible to get when they come in stock. After trying with multiple companies and multiple times with Wal-Mart, we were finally able to purchase one online on 12/15/2020. While yes this sounds great, the rest has been nothing short of atrocious. Below is the issue at hand...1. Order placed on 12/15/2020 and advised it would arrive by end of day Fri, Jan 8th.2. Order was shipped from Groveport, OH, only two hours away from my home address, to AZ and then to the Walmart warehouse in Waco,TX. This made no sense.3. I called Wal-Mart on 12/22 and said that something did not seem right with the order being shipped all the way across the US. I was informed not to worry and that it was part of the shipping process. I have worked in returns at Amazon and also worked in logistics, I knew that was not the truth but the customer service agent insisted it was ok.4. On 12/23 the order showed delivered in Waco,TX even though I was told the day before by the Walmart customer service representative that it would be shipped back to my home address which they verified with myself and FedEx multiple, multiple times. Walmart informed me that they realized there was a mistake and that FedEx was going back to get the packages that were mis-shipped in order to get them to the correct locations.6. On 12/24 after noticing the above mentioned mistake, I contacted Walmart immediately. I was informed again, even after it showed delivered, that it would be sent to my home address. 7. I called FedEx to confirm and they agreed, as well as the Walmart agent, that the item would still get delivered and to wait 72 hours.8. At this point a customer service agent by the name of Oscar decided he was going to cancel the order without even asking if we wanted him to do so. He then told me that IF/WHEN I get the item to call back and he would charge the card again. SOMEONE should have called the warehouse before 12/23 when I mentioned the issue and definitely should have called on 12/24 when the order showed delivered and it wasn't correct.9. I waited over the 72 hours and called back to speak with customer service and this is when things went absolutely south. I was now told that the item was returned and there was nothing they could do and since there is none in stock, they can't even preorder one and ship it when stock comes in. I have spent over 14 hours this past week alone on the phone trying to get this situation handled and again NOBODY has seemed to help. One representative offered me a $25 coupon if I spent $45 or more. Is that really how you want them to handle these types of situations?Now to the reason why this is such a big deal to me and I hope you can have enough heart to understand and to make this right. This was my son's ONLY Christmas gift and now I have to tell him he isn't getting anything. Since the package was originally going to show up late, I wrapped the receipt in a box for him to open on Christmas day. I even bought him NBA 2K21 and a headset for the Playstation 5. What good are those now? How would you handle that Mr. McMillon? Please tell me how that is right in any sort of way? Do you want to make the phone call to tell him?I even asked them to just send me one when the next shipment comes in so that I don't have to try and play the game of getting one. It was already almost impossible to get this one. Surprise, surprise, I was told no to that as well and basically sent on my way like nothing ever happened. If this does not get resolved, I will take this to the next level. I will contact every media station I know to get this story out, I will post on every social media site, I will write every review I possibly can, and I will NEVER, I repeat NEVER, shop at Walmart again. This has been the WORST customer experience I have EVER had with ANY retailer. You should be ashamed of your company for acting in this manner Mr. McMillon.",0,1

After DAYS of trying to get help online and threatening to light up my reviews on social media, the offered to “refund or replace the item”... I chose refund since they’re incompetent... of course they mailed me another (also broken cart)... I asked them to please stop sending me stuff and got a refund. They messed up the refund for the soup (which I had to talk to an agent for over half hour to get). A couple years ago I bought a washing machine and it arrived looking like it had been run over by a semi. They never refunded my money... sent a replacement to the wrong location, so I bought a washer.... and ended up with nothing after hauling the broken one back to the store myself since they refused to pick it up.

Walmart,"Grassfield Walmart, Chesapeake, VA 23323","I visited the Grassfield Store in Chesapeake,Va last night and it was ridiculous! This has always been my favorite store until yesterday!! The store was in a disarray! I walked in and there was a thin black girl playing on one of the mobile carts, driving between the displays and the register yelling to another guy standing in the isle, who was laughing & texting on his phone. Got to the mens department and there were clothes thrown everywhere - looked around and the entire store had items strewed all over the entire store!! These are slip hazards, so we told an employee that was in the clothing department and while stepping over clothes she says ""yep"" and walks away!! We went to the service desk to turn in a pricing device we found in the center isle on the floor & tell her about all the clothes and the stealing going on - the store ""manager"" laughed (a young girl) & said in a -I don't care attitude - ""yeah it belongs to the electronic department"" nothing was even said about the stealing or the mess. We witnessed a lady stealing (she had a HUGE purse - stuffing things in it) , we witnessed staff playing in the store, multiple employees staring on their phones, sarcastic employees, fall hazards, displaced electronic pricing item - what happened to this store?????",0,1

RIDICULOUS... The lines for self checkout was lined up into the produce dept. I saw three people walk out just in my line I was the 4th, leaving their buggies which means the emplyees would have to put all the merchandise away. I spoke to the person at the door and told her they were losing alot of business she confirmed she knew. You need new managers who actually care about the paying customers.

My first order was cancelled by Walmart stating that the fraud department found unusual activity on the order! Are you serious? I contacted, through live chat, a representative who told me to reorder the item after an hour of my call to them but within 24 hours using the same device I used for my original order. I didn’t do that. Instead, my husband placed the order on his computer. Since it was a gift, it was stated that the tricycle would be shipped in a Walmart box so the recipient wouldn’t see what was inside. The tricycle arrived in record fast time but the tricycle was not in a box😡 It was left outside the house with no box, paperwork or instructions allowing anyone to see it (including my Granddaughter). Anyone could have picked it up and walked away with it. My husband checked the delivery email which was supposed to have a delivery snapshot of the purchase...there was no such thing in the email.

Walmart,Walmart-Not living up to Covid 19 precautions,"Walmart needs to have a contact point for how well it is doing on Covid 19. I went to your Walmart in Lake Jackson, Texas Dec. 28, 2020 between 8:00 and 9:00 am. I planned to purchase 2 lbs of Deli ham. The staff that came up to help me had her mask hanging on her chin. I told her she could not help me. I went to the service desk and told them I want a person wearing a mask to help. The Lead over the area did meet me at the deli. She was wearing a mask. I asked her if it was protocol for the staff to wear their mask correctly. She said it was. I pointed out that the other staff was still not wearing her mask correctly. the lead said she had talked to the staff. The staff person was standing by the slicing machine moving her mask up and down with her hands to pantomime her mask would not stay up. The lead person said she was going to get the staff another mask. At that point I left. I have worn a mask since March, and have always been able to keep it up. Walmart apparently does not have appropriate mask readily available to its staff, and not trained their staff in pandemic hygiene. That a person would be allowed to wear a mask incorrectly, and display to a customer moving it up and down with the same hands that will get your order ready is not acceptable. I understand you cannot be responsible for all your customers, but you are responsible for your staff. I intend to spread this experience as far, and as often as possible.",0,2

Walmart,30 year loyal customer boycotting Walmart,"It really blows my mind that the largest corporation in the world would has such awful customer service. No one can think for themselves all they can do is read from a script. I received a defected item and they will not replace it. They use shady 3rd parties and do not care if something is wrong, they will not help you AT ALL (that is the shortened version). I'm not even trying to get a refund I'm trying to do an exchange! I literally am trying to buy the same exact item from them. They are not losing a single penny over this! This is not the first time something like this has happened, so I will be boycotting them. Even tiny new businesses have better customer service, business practices, and morals compared to Walmart. Downright unprofessional and incompetent. Shop local and if you can't at least go to Target where the employees are decent people and can think for themselves.",0,1

Walmart,The worst delivery company “Estes worldwide forwarding “,"Normally, I never had a problem with ordering from Walmart until I encountered a third party delivery service called Estes worldwide forwarding. This was the worst company I’ve ever had to deal with for delivery. The 70” flatscreen set in their warehouse for a week before they setup the delivery, then they sent out a email saying no stairs I told them there is 15 steps to my door, so the delivery was canceled So I called for a refund, the next day I received a unknown caller, I decided to call it back and it was the delivery guy that said he was in front of my house to deliver. But now he is 45 min away and I must reschedule. I told him That I was home did he knock on the door. He said no, smh! If the order was canceled why is he at the door without letting me know that they was going to deliver anyway. Walmart should definitely use a different delivery service. I will not spend money with Walmart.com until they use a dependable delivery service..I have no Christmas gift and the money is in limbo.",0,1

Walmart,Why do we use Walmart.com website,"Why do we use Walmart.com website? So, if the item is available, we can head to the store to purchase it or if not available, we can order online. No, it does not work this way. I got online to purchase the Arris Surfboard modem SB8200. Walmart online showed that it was available only online and ""not available for pickup"". This told me that it was useless for me to go to the store since it was not there. Because of this, I ordered it and now must wait 9 days for it to delivered. An hour later, I headed to Walmart to pick up meds at the pharmacy. Since I was there, I drop by electronics. Guess what, there were 4 Arris SB8200 modems. Of course, I bought it. When I got home, I attempted to cancel my online order. I was not able to do it since it was processed. Now tell me this, it still shows that it will be delivered in 9 days, so why was I not able to cancel this order. I did a chat and tried to cancel but they could not. So I asked why did it make me order this online when it should have simple told me that it was available in store for pickup.I kept asking why did your website say, ""not available for pickup"". I could not get an answer. I was told that when the item arrives take it to Walmart for a refund. It now comes to this, whenever you go to walmart online and you see something you want and it says ""not available for pickup"", get on the phone and call Walmart to check, more likely it is there in the store.",0,1

Walmart,STAY AWAY FROM WALMART ONLINE ORDERS!!,"STAY AWAY FROM WALMART ONLINE ORDERS!!I ordered an Instant Pot cooker on November 19th during the Black Friday sale. I was super excited to get this for my mom for Christmas as she had wanted one for a couple of years, and this one was 50% off during the sale!Since they were sold out at my local store I decided to place the order online, with shipping showing it would be ready for pick up at my local store for December 13th. This already seemed like a pretty unreasonable amount of shipping time (especially for a company as well established as Walmart) as I order things online all of the time and have ordered things directly from China that have been here in under 2 weeks. but considering the pandemic circumstances, the time of year, and that it was still supposed to arrive well before Christmas, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and placed the order.Dec 13th, no correspondence showing that my package had been delivered to the store and was ready for pick up, so I checked the tracking and this was (and still is) the latest update: ""Mon, Nov 30On the move | 10:48 amCalgary, ABShipment left distribution center and is in-transit to pickup store""I thought it strange that the latest update was in Clgary, and from nearly 2 weeks prior, as Calgary is only a day drive from where I am, but decided to give it a few days just incase there was a hold up on their end for a couple days, which does happen from time to time and is not unreasonable.Dec 17th, still no update from my local store informing me to pick up, and tracking still showed in transit to pick up store from Calgary. At this point, with a week until Christmas, I felt I should reach out to customer service and see if they could help me out at all.After 40 minutes on hold I was able to speak with a live agent who told me that they would look into this matter and get back to me in 2-3 days... huh? that is unusual, but okay all I want is for this package to be here by Christmas, so I play the game.Dec 21st, Still nothing. No call. No email. No update tracking. No sign of my package at my local store. Now I'm getting a little frustraighted.I call into customer service, and again have the pleasure of waiting on hold for 45 mins to speak with a live agent. This agent takes my order number and just reiterates what the tracking is telling me and I tell him that there is no way it should take 3 weeks (Nov 30th - Dec 21st) for a package to come from Clagary to my local store. He says all he can do is refund my order, so I ask to speak to a supervisor.After 1.5hrs on hold(!!!) I get to speak with a manager who (in very broken English) informs me that it is an issue on their end and that they may have lost the package, and that all he can do is offer me a refund, but this will take 7 - 10 business days, and when I receive the refund I can go buy the product from my local store..I explain to him that I purchased this product for 50% off ($70 vs. $140) and that I have waited over a month, and through no fault of my own I have never received the product. And even if he were to issue a refund, I would still have to pay full retail price ($140), when I had already purchased it from them for half that price! I asked if, at very least they could honor that sale price so I could pick this up for my Mom before Christmas to which we offered me a TEN DOLLAR STORE CREDIT!This is the only resolution that was offered to me and the over all tone of the conversation was very ""You are SOL, sir"".There is no other customer support team or contact number for anyone, so I have no option but to cancel this order and except this refund wich will not be enough to purchase this product at full retail price. I am now scrambling to find another present for my Mom before Christmas.SHAME ON YOU WALMART! Thank you for making a horrible year even worse. Merry Christmas.",0,1

Walmart,BAIT AND SWITCH TACTICS,"We ordered a webcam from Walmart.com at the beginning of December. It was available from many reputable vendors, but Walmart’s price was slightly lower, so we decided to try them. Item never arrived on the day it was promised.I called Walmart and got some outsourced customer service rep who stated that there had been no “movement” for the last 5 days and that the item was lost. Therefore, we should cancel the order. I asked if a replacement would be sent. He said they do not send replacements, but that I could order the same item for $30 more (about $109). I told him this was unacceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. He said none were available and that he put a request in to have one possibly call me back within 24 hours. I told him I would like to resolve the matter today in case I needed to place the order with another company.He recommended that I cancel the current order and place a new order at the higher price. He then suggested I call in after the order had gone through and request a price adjustment to the original price I paid. I replied that I was skeptical that I would receive said adjustment, after canceling the first order and paying the higher price. I also expressed that it seemed unethical to process my original order at a lower price and then try to charge me more for the SAME EXACT ITEM I never received.I asked if they could expedite the order, since it hadn’t arrived on the promised date. They said no, not unless I wanted to pay for it. I asked what recourse I would have if the item once again did not arrive. He replied, just keep calling and canceling your order for refunds. This was not satisfactory customer service.Had I known Walmart would try to bait and switch us, I would have ordered from another vendor a week ago and I would already be in possession of said item. Instead, I am left with no item, terrible customer service from Walmart, and will be placing the order with another, more reputable company that stands by their prices and service. I asked to speak to a Walmart customer service supervisor and was told that one would “call me back within 24 hours”. I never heard from them. Shocking. Shame on me for believing in a company with such a bad reputation. I will not be using Walmart.com again.",0,1

I tried several time to leave a product review about my experience on the product page, but since it was negative, it was NEVER posted (tried several time too). However, a positive review was posted by what appears to be another customer without problem. Walmart now have a chat system with robot, so you don't even talk to someone when you have an issue. Only option that robot/chat offers you is send the item for a refund. You have to really try hard, clicking on the right question for the chat-bot to finally be able to talk to someone.",0,1
Walmart,Wal-Mart on line ordering SUCKS,Wal-Mart on line ordering SUCKS ! The CHEAP dumb MORONS ship the items in the factory boxes & the items were to be Christmas gifts but Thanks to Wal-Mart they ruined my Christmas ! SO UPSETTING & SAD ! Anyone else that I ordered stuff from for Christmas shipped the items in Shipping boxes but NOT CHEAP ASS WAL-MART & when I spoken with their costumer service they could CARE LESS !!! ALSO do NOT buy Wal-Marts 3 year warranty because the Hoover inpulse Vacuum comes with a 2 year factory warranty & when you buy Wal-Marts 3 year warranty it runs concurrently with the factory warranty so you only get 1 year but pay for 3 so it is a SCAM that Wal-Mart is running & they should be investigated for SCAMMING people this way & should be SUED for it !

Walmart,I was never able to purchase this item…,"I was never able to purchase this item to be able give a review. I went to 3 different stores where this item was suppose to have been ""in stock"". Instead upon getting there I found this exact item, with an entirely different sku number which registered a higher price. Exact being of same color, size, dimensions, make and model number. Beware people this is case of ""BAIT AND SWITCH"". Only advertising this item online as ""pick up only"" and upon getting to the store instead of finding the advertised item you find the same item at a higher price and not willing to either honor the advertised price or option to even place the order online and then pick it up to ensure you stick to your budget and not waste gas driving to different stores unnecessarily or to have it delivered. Bait-and-switch is a form of FRAUD USED IN RETAIL SALES but also employed in other contexts. First, customers are ""baited"" by merchants' advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store, they discover that the advertised goods are not available, or the customers are pressured by salespeople to consider similar, but higher-priced items (""switching"").Bait-and-switch techniques have a long and widespread history as a part of commercial culture and is used more heavily around holiday times. This practice si very disturbing to me. I needed ans still need 4 of these bins for organizing my house on the budget in which I set out to spend. So now I have to search for this item elsewhere preferably at the same price or maybe slightly slightly higher. I only leave this review because of the inconvenience of not being able to actually purchase what was advertised and wasting time and gas going to other stores that claimed to have then in stock when indeed they did not. Which in turn pissed me off. Now my project has to take longer than my initial projected time.Item:Sterilite 30-Gallon Tote BoxWalmart # 550367700BEWARE CONSUMERS!

His name was Rahjin he did not provide us he last name as he refused. The cashier on number 3 named sharmdeep was so rude as he is talking his language to other associates and they are just laughing at us.

I will keep writing this kind of this review until this gets handled. I believe in good customer service and I was not rude at all both managers were so rude on the telephone.

Customer service was the worst I’ve ever experienced, and I work retail! They did nothing to track down my package and all they offered to do was contact the 3rd party to see what happened, and said I would hear back in the next 48 hours. My fiancé is a travel nurse working Covid units and will be leaving in 48 hours, but apparently their hands are tied. Who knows why they didn’t offer to put in a SIF order and have it to me as soon as possible. They did nothing, and should take accountability for their delivery drivers or package handlers openly stealing, sending the conformation that the package was delivered and then defending them. My door was WIDE OPEN all day, I had 3 other packages delivered no problem. This is the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced, and while I was edgy about depending on Walmart to deliver in the first place, this just confirmed that their customer service is trash and no one in upper management cares about what they do for a living.",0,1

So I called and was informed I could not return it. I have also had other items that are not allowed to be returned because of Covid and have had to just throw away that were well within the return period.

Its unfortunate that such a needed service has such poor performance issues. I most cases, the exterior packaging was not damaged, so have to believe that the person filling the order was well aware of inferior goods being sent out to customers resulting in returns and poor customer reviews and experiences. I will not be able to order food from Walmart.com again, since I have lost trust in their ability to provide food in edible condition. Now I must repackage and drop off to a facility to return the items, which is impossible for me since I am high risk and will not go inside any building and talk to any person for any reason.

Walmart,"Don’t Shop at Walmart, Terrible Company","I ordered a Hanukkah gift from the Walmart website November 28th to make sure I received it on time. It was supposed to be here yesterday, 12/14. I waited over two weeks to receive this item and I then receive an email saying that it was delayed. I contacted customer service, which is severally lacking in professionalism. I felt like I was talking to a robot, but they said it was a live agent. She then blamed the company Melissa and Doug where the product was coming from and said it was no fault of theirs that the order was not delivered on time. The agent then said after further review the order had been lost entirely in transit and that once again was not the fault of Walmart. I ordered it through them and think they should take responsibility if a product is not delivered. The spelling and helpfulness of this agent was atrocious. They then kept repeating if I wanted it resent or refunded. I asked when it would get here by and they responded January 5th. I made this order at the end of November and I wouldn’t receive it until January. I just found this whole experience to be terrible. If they can’t guarantee shipping/delivery they should not sell this item on their website. They kept blaming the other company and I asked since this was in fact Walmart’s fault if I could get the order expedited to ensure I received it before the end of Hanukkah. She just said no, that she would refund it. One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with a company. I assure you I will never shop here again. Now days before the end of Hanukkah I have to scramble to get a gift. Since they did not communicate with me about this issue I can’t look online to find another gift. Horrible customer service, terrible company and overall very very unsatisfied with what happened with this order. I hope others will learn from my experience and not shop at Walmart.",0,1

None of this is really their fault either its all walmarts fault for having poor policies to handle customer refunds for items canceled by WALMART, for having a website that says something is in stock and then letting the order go through and charging the person money only to email that person four hours later saying sorry we don't actually have that item but your money will be refunded automatically only to let them find out that automatically actually means 3 to 5 buisness days. And I get that mistakes happen every once in awhile and it would be all fine but out of the 5 online orders I have placed for instore pickup in the last month 4 of them were canceled thats a 20% success rate, good job walmart. And on top of that one of the itmes I ordered that was canceled because it was out of stock was not actually out of stock there was about 25 them sitting on the shelf when I went in 20 minutes after I got the cancelation email and when I asked customer service about it they called the person up that goes and picks that stuff up and they said oh yeah that item is out of stock I went and looked my self (while I am holding said item in my hand in their store) then.when I said you have like 25 of them sitting back there he said oh well sorry must have missed them.

Well after I went back to find there were no more and I checked every time I was there for 3 months and when they finally came in I brought to customer service and they could not find the book but found my receipt with the purchase and REFUSED to replace the bottles, and as I do go shopping for my work (not after this incident) it was hard to watch the 1 employee who knows I spend $400 a week for a treatment center not help or think that I am trying to scam Walmart out of $4.00. After employee refused to replace I called customer service who advised I had to call the store manager and of course I could not get a response just the run around. What really is hard for me is now is I will always go elsewhere however it comes at a more expensive cost but it’s probably for the better as there are less people and better quality food at the other markets. Thanks for reading and do not forget no matter how small of a purchase or incident do not let a person or company blow you off when you know you have done right.",0,1

The person who answered told me the item wasn't in (no problem) but when I asked if they knew when they would be getting more in, I was met with a rude tone and told to check online. Guess what, Walmart currently isn't showing that item online in their inventory nation wide, so it's a bit hard to check on line for something they don't have listed. *EDIT* I've been going to the store for the last few days in order to have a chance to get the item I want. I take time out of my day, I show up before the store opens and wait in line to see if they have restocked. This morning I get there, wait, walk in at open, only to find that the employees have been allowed to wait inside before the general public, and were sold the item first. Guess what, they ran out once they got to me. That means out of the available supply on hand only ONE was sold to the general public (I was 2nd in line of people waiting outside), the rest were sold to the staff, who did not have to wait outside, and had the unfair advantage of not only being let in early to get the item, but probably knew it was going to be there before hand. Worst ran store I have ever come across. The customer is treated like a bother, when all they want is some kind of reasonable answer to a question, and they obviously don't put customers first.",0,1

The order not cancelled was the second order placed and from the same computer with the same information. Today, shows a pending release of money from my bank account. How is that possible? If the IP watchdogs cancel the first order minutes after sending the other order. No, clear answers! No, email to let me know it is the ""IP's fault"" ! So, I cancelled the other order. I cannot have one child's package arrive and not the other. I hope my cancellation goes through, I am not looking forward to attempting to get a refund.

Over the last month I contacted Walmart.com multiple times and was ASSURED that the items would be fulfilled at some point and not to cancel. So I did not.

I called walmart.com (no US reps by the way) who was unable to offer an explanation why they were cancelled. I am furious.

Walmart,When I think of Walmart....,"When I think of Walmart, I usually think of decent prices and more choices than I can imagine so why is their website (Walmart.com) the EXACT opposite? For example- My husband is working through the pandemic and is able to do a little shopping after work and brought me home the cutes snow man mug with spoon that was only $4.99+tax so I wanted to get him a cute Christmas mug in return. But since I watch our children 24/7 and am not about to take them out in a pandemic I thought looking on the website for one and some Christmas shopping would be a good idea. I was dead Wrong. Why is it that in stores they have the cutes mugs for $5 but online they have THE UGLIEST, worst selection of disgusting looking mugs for $14.00 and up!? And this is just an example of ALL pricing and items on ""Walmart"".com. Looking through this and seeing how this can possibly work in their favor, I've come to the conclusion that walmart.com is NOT Walmart and does not carry what's in stores (unless you're shopping in produce), or store prices because their website is to limit and up-sale items that wouldn't do well to sell in stores. So they only put select, less appealing items on the site to make it seem like these are your only options and then they up the prices because they know since you think this is all that is available, you'll buy it at outrageous prices without thinking twice about it.

Walmart,Kannapolis Walmart Issues with Customer Service,"My wife and I visit this store at least 2 times a week. We have had issues in the past but nothing like today. Was in the store going through the self check out. After I rang in all my products I realized the register was for card only. I wanted to use cash. I usually use card but this time I had a lot of cash I need to get out of my hands. So I called the store rep that was working that area over. She was so rude. So I asked what I needed to do. She said I will cancel your order and she did. Then I asked her what I needed to do. She yelled at the top of her voice ""I dont know"". Then turned and walked away. I got a manager who over and explained to her what happened. She put me on another register that accepted cash. I asked what she was going to do with the employee. Had another customer come over and confirmed his family seen the whole event and she did exactly what I said she did. The manager went to speak with her. I was literally standing within hearing distance of the conversation. They thought it was a big joke. So I asked for another manager. She never got one for me. So I went to customer service and they called another manager up. I explained it to her. She shrugged it off like it was no big deal. I explained to her if I decide to come back to that store and I see that employee at that store then nobody in my family would ever shop there again. And she stated that the employee would not be fired. She was just talk to her. So the employee screamed at the top of her lungs in front of everybody in the store and she will not be fired? And why was she even working that area when she had no idea how to answer a simple question? And I am going to post this incident online and through all social media. Again, I am telling you if I see her there again nobody in my family will ever shop Walmart again. And I am certain I heard in the conversation she was having with the manager some racist terms toward me. But who cares? I guess I will let the viewers of my feedbacks determined if they care. The manager stated the employees name was Briana. But I am certain she was covering and gave me a false name. The name on the receipt shows Phebe. The incident happened at the Kannapolis location store Number 02005 on 12/7/2020 at approx 3pm. It happened at the self checkout left side of store as you are walking in. I still have the receipt if you need anymore information. I am going to copy this conversation and post it for others to review as well. I never want to see anyone fired.

Order was placed on the 25th of November and it was scheduled to be delivered on the 3rd of Dec. The 3rd of December arrived and... nothing showed up. USPS (their chosen delivery method) marked the item as 'delayed'. I waited (hoping) until the 7th of Dec to make an phone inquiry on the ETA/condition of my item. During the phone call, the Walmart Customer Service employee told me the watch had been lost during transit. The employee refunded my account, but mentioned she couldn't/wouldn't replace the item -- and couldn't/wouldn't give me the 'Black Friday' special discount I received when I originally placed an order. This was one and only time I've ever ordered this kind of item through Walmart during a 'special' event. I won't be doing so again; I don't care what kind of 'deal' they are running.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart.com will never be Amazon,Walmart.com will never be Amazon. First time ordering from.Walmart.com and will be my last. I'll pay a little more to have customer service and fast shipping from.Amazon. it doesn't take almost 2 and half weeks to get an item from Amazon. WALMART uses pony express and takes 2 weeks to a month. They need to give it up it will never get big like Amazon with no customer service or horrible rude employees when you try to find out where your product is. 0 stars would be better than 1 star.

Walmart,Was in Walmart 3037 on Upper James in…,"Was in Walmart 3037 on Upper James in Hamilton i checked out at 9:06am. So lets say it was less than busy. As i waited in line for their one employee to do a COVID screening on everyone i then had to turn around to get a buggy as they are ""no longer allowed"" to have them in the store. I entered the store to get verbally accosted by an emplyee for not doing the screening. Then within minutes was accosted again by another employee cause of arrows on the floor. Then proceeded to hear them say they are fed up witb this ""s**t"". Then as I enter the cashier line the cashier was wearing a ""black lives matter "" facemask. I feel therre is no place in walmart for peoples policital views as a woman assaulted by a black mater I found this mask offensive. Then waited on the phone when I got home for 30 minutes to have someone pick it up I was told yeah yeah yeah. The Manager didnt care about the complaints and was told wearing an offensive mask is ok as long as they wear a mask. Absolutely disgusting customer service as they just dont care about the consumers.",0,1

This was my first and only time that I have did online shopping period and I will never do it again especially to Walmart. I was given a 15.00 e gift card but I feel that I should of been offered a lot more. I also made a mistake with my email address with ONE letter and I was told there was no way it could be fixed, so if I did get a email sent I would never know. This is very bad business for a billion dollar company. My nine year olds birthday was on the first of December it was to arrive, I had to cancel and redo my order it was told to me that it’s the holiday by some or COVID-19 by others it was supposed to arrive on the 4 th still no laptop.

Walmart,Third party sellers using walmart…,Third party sellers using walmart online. Walmart has a cancel tool. When you use it the seller sees this and marks it shipped. Making it difficult to not receive an item you want cancelled. It is not appropriate for a seller to claim shipped and use the carriers names when the carrier is not in possession. Walmart has mostly third party sellers. Be very careful when purchasing with walmart these days. Only buy walmart fufillment items as not have problems and tie up your funds. Third party sellers are the worst. They are out of country and use places like new york. Allentown pa. And others as a shipping out point. It isnt true. They have to come into the country first. You can be waiting for extended amounts of time for your purchase. With the holidays coming it is quite risky to tie up your money with these third party sellers that walmart is representing. Shop elsewhere if you can during these times.,0,1

It was a couple christmas presents. So now I have to wait for the money to go back to my account? The web said they had 7 left! Now I'm out that money til it goes back in my account!

The associate I dealt with said he could do nothing. He said I had to call. So I called customer service and after an hour, I was told they were sorry but there was nothing they could do. The product was still online, but for double the price. They refused to price match. Such bad service. No customer service at all. I talked to a supervisor who said there was nothing she would do other than apologize. She said it was a third party item, and and the third party had cancelled the order to raise the price.",0,1

Of course not available It fake advertising and apparently they call center employees dont know that. Lisa if that's her real name finally answer the phone and I had to tell her that she should look at the item before talking to customers so she would have an idea what to said since she kept telling things that was not in the add.long story short Walmart I love you guys but your employees should have more knowledge and less sarcasm I have the record of the conversation and she couldn't be more sassyI understand that add sometimes have mistakes and all but if the store employees give sarcasm doesnt help the company. She really doesnt know how how to handle a call.",0,1
Walmart,Self checkout is a set up,"On Friday night, my 12 years old son and I went to Walmart on Liberia Ave in Manassas, VA, to purchase a few items for our new apartment. I directed him to get into a line while I grab some Hawaiian bread. Moments later, I found him at self-checkout. I did not want him at self-checkout because our few items turned into many. However, he was checking out, and I joined him. My total was over $110. As we proceeded to exit the store. A woman with her badge name in hand stopped my son as if he was a grown man to ask him to come inside a room with him. I quickly interjected, asking what in the world was going on. The initial lady and her partner tried to coax us to go behind a closed door with them, I refused. My reasoning, 1) we have COVID running rampant, and 2). They were in plainclothes (how am I to assume they worked at the store). They proceeded to tell me that they needed to search my items; however, they needed to do it behind closed doors. I absolutely refused. Again, at this part, I had no idea why we are being stopped for a search. Begrudgingly, they searched my items in the opened space between the two main doors. I demanded to know why my items were being searched. They finally told me that the things I purchased did not match the items in the cart. I allowed them to continue their search. In the end, we did not scan two 1.99 drinks. My son, being 12 he forgot to scan these items. Although it was not enough to file charges, the head employee stated that she needed to write down my son's name. I told her absolutely not. I gave her an option to write mine, but she would not get the name of my black son who unintentionally placed items in the cart. Needless to say, I walked away without given his name for $4 worth of drinks.Additionally, I vowed never to step foot in that Walmart (within walking distance of my home). Parents and customers beware of Wal-Mart self-checkout lines. Miss scanning an item can lead to serious allegations. When you have too many things to handle at self-checkout, go to a cashier. Although the wait may be long, it is worth leaving with a peach of mind.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart online customer service are a bunch of liars,We ordered a TV off walmart.com and when we received it it had a line down the center. We called our Walmart and said that we wanted a new TV because of the line and they said that there was not in stock that they would put us on a list and let us know period after 3 months at gone by we had not heard anything so we wanted a refund they said that they couldn't do a refund in store that we had to do it online which was a lie. so we went through the online service which they sent an expedited truck to pick up the TV and then three months later we were still waiting on our refund which when we called several times they said that it was lost our package hasn't been received yet our refund was on the way they lost the refund they gave us so many excuses it was ridiculous after a while finally we got our refund but it took way too long and way too many times of waiting online for an hour for someone to tell us a big lie I hate walmart.com and it's a joke.,0,1

Walmart,"Account was hacked, and that was just the first of a string of bad experiences.","Walmart.com and grocery.walmart.com is run and overseen by the most monumentally incompetent people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. So terrible that I wrote this, my only review for trustpilot, which I didn't even know existed until I searched for some way to leave a review.Where to begin.First off, Walmart.com was where I experienced my first and only attempted account hack. This was several years ago now, but I remember looking at my phone as my credit card company sought to verify that I was truly attempting to buy several iPads and have them arranged for pickup in another state. I got to say ""No"" and head that off at the pass, but that was strike one.To put this in perspective: I'm a programmer. I not only code for a living, but I code login systems. I know about account security. I had a unique, randomly generated password (thank God) for the site for the single time I made a purchase on it. But Walmart apparently stored credit card information on their servers, and when THEY got hacked, it meant people were able to circumvent normal credit card protections and order things. So, I had to get a new credit card because of their incompetence.Okay, whatever. I just never went back to the site.Recently, I decided to try the Walmart Grocery delivery service, for convenience. So I sign up for a free 30 day trial. Bad enough that the first order is plagued by issues because their ""security"" is making you fill out a captcha every 5 minutes that passes. Note: this is even if you're active on their site, not just if you logout, or even if you go idle. So right away, bad website.Whatever. I deal with it, get in my order. I schedule the delivery for 2-3pm, three days later. This is a grocery delivery. I figure, 3 days, plenty of time to get it together. 3pm? Well, my apartment locks its doors at 5pm. 2-3pm? I don't have to be there, they can leave it at the door as instructed.So, the delivery day rolls around. At 2pm I get notifications they need to replace 2 items with near equivalents. That's fine! I don't mind. 3:30pm, the order is still stuck at 'preparing'. Well, that's fine, I just need it there before 5pm.Around 4pm, still stuck, I get worried. There was no notice, no update. I contact customer service and tell them what's up. They, via web chat, tell me 'They'll priotize my order' and instantly cut me off.4:45pm rolls around, no update. I contact again. They use a form response to apologize, but tell me the order should be there soon. I explain: yeah, if it arrives after 5pm, the door is locked and it can't be delivered. They say, well, we can cancel and reschedule delivery if you like. I say, cancel it completely, I don't even want it anymore.Then they inform me that they actually can't cancel the order because 'it has already been loaded into the car'. I explain: that won't mean a damn thing, because the door to the complex locks at 5pm, so you can't even reach my door. They say they're sorry but maybe after the delivery I can attempt to cancel.Sure enough, 5:15pm I get harangued by calls by some number which I don't take because I don't want the order and I'm not there to open any doors. Email updates with 'Your item is on its way!' Tracking the item says it's arrived.Which it hasn't, because it can't, because *the doors are locked and I'm not there*.This is one of the biggest companies in the world and they can't even meet half the quality of an interaction with Amazon, their nearest competitor, who I have faith will completely destroy them one day, even if that means the entire damn world is run by Jeff Bezos.Do not use this service, or if you do, be warned: you're dealing with ludicrous incompetence, at all levels.Edit: There's more.At 8:15pm I received an email notifying me that my order was delivered and that a photo of the delivery was available. It was NOT delivered, and the photo was just a broken jpeg link. I contacted customer service and they refunded me, and I will receive credit in up to 5 days.Great.And on top of this, on top of all this: on their email there's a link to leave them a review. I decide to do that. I enter yet another captcha, then I write up my experiences and press submit.Immediately I get told: Sorry, our site is experiencing technical difficulties but they'll be back soon!But there's a ""Retry"" button. I click that... and I get the same form, with what I entered now cleared.I give up.",0,1

Walmart,Never EVER buy anything from Walmart.com!!!,"I would just like to say, for the benefit of everyone's sanity, never (and I do mean ever!) buy anything through Walmart.com! A month ago I ordered a TV from Walmart.com because they allow financing through Affirm. I was told that I should expect a call from the shipping company by Friday Nov. 13th to schedule an appointment for delivery. Friday, 2 weeks from my order date, finally arrives and no call. I try to call them and end up on hold for 3 hours for them to tell me ""we were denied access to the order by Walmart and it was never picked up."" After which I called Walmart who said that they had a signature showing it was picked up. I called back the shipper, another 3 hours on hold (with a replaying message stating just 10 minutes more) and they say ""well our computer shows it was never picked up"" and I told them what Walmart's representative told me to which they replied ""hmm. Weird. Well, nothing I can do for you, you need to sort it out with Walmart."" I call Walmart back and they tell me that they will call the shipper and sort it out. I stay on hold while they do this and they told me that the shipper said they found the order and that I should expect a message in the next 48 hours to schedule the delivery. I am very annoyed at this, but stuff happens, so I wait. It was a friday, so I waited another 2 days just in case they meant business days. Still nothing. I call the shipper (another 2-3 hours on hold) and they say they never even heard from Walmart. I call Walmart and they tell me I should just assume the TV was lost in shipping and they will get me a new one. They said to expect another 2 weeks of shipping, I asked if they would go through another company and they told me they don't have control over that. Luckily (or so I thought) They did end up shipping through somebody else. This time I didn't wait, I was told to wait until the 1st for them to contact me for an appointment, but when they didn't call by the 29th I took the liberty to schedule an appointment online through the email they sent me. I got a confirmation saying that the TV would arrive on the 2nd sometime between 10 am and 2pm. I had my brother come over so that he could help me bring it in (they don't provide that service) and we waited until 3pm only for me to find an email 'confirming your appointment' in which the fine print said the appointment was for the next day, I had never been contacted for this change and nothing in the title of the email suggested a change in time for the appointment. Furthermore, I still had the email stating the appointment for the original day. I called them to straighten this out and they basically told me there was nothing they could do. Whatever, at least I had a delivery date. That brings us to today. I waited all day, and no surprise they were late. A 4 hour delivery window and they still managed to show up 30 minutes late. To their credit, the driver actually did help me bring in the TV. I had to wait a few hours to open it so that my wife would be home and so I would be out of class (I have online classes for nursing school). When we finally did open the box we found that the entire front of the TV was destroyed. Walmart made this entire process as excruciating as they possibly could have, and now I need to take this broken POS to a store to return it so that I can get my refund and buy a new TV from ANYWHERE EXCEPT FREAKING WALMART. I repeat, never, and I do mean ever, buy anything from Walmart.com (unless your into pulling your hair out and having to pull teeth to get any updates about what you ordered.)I know it's cliche, but I really wish I could give this 0 stars, or just a large warning that reads TURN BACK NOW, BUYER BEWARE!!!!",0,1

Walmart,Dangerous Walmart Pickup for Online Orders,"On 11/29/20 we ordered three items online, Two were shipped properly to our home but one of the items had to be for pickup at the store. We drove 3 days later to the Walmart on Cattleman in Sarasota FL. The idea of online ordering is to avoid going inside while covid is a risk. The Pickup was in the far back of the store in the area of bathrooms. That defeats the purpose of safety. We were the first people in line. No one was there to help and ringing the bell did nothing. We waited 10 minutes. In that time 2 other people came for pickup. One refused to bring up her mask which was on her neck. More bell ringing but no one came. Finally a supervisor showed up but was unable to locate our item even though we had the complete printout of our order 6052066-876512. In addition, people were using the bathrooms. It became a traffic area. So we left. What the heck is the matter with you Walmart? Why locate Pickup at the far back of the store forcing people who want too avoid contact to travel the whole store? Why don't clerks answer the bell? Why can't you locate our final item when we had the printout? Why have Pickup with the bathrooms which guarantees high people traffic?

Upon completion of my order, I saw that it was going to take almost a month before I would receive it. It finally came 3 weeks after ordering it, but they didn't send me 2 x 1 kilo spools. They sent me 2 x 200 gram spools. I called Walmart and tried to use the extension for customer service but nobody answered after trying 4 times. I tried other extensions like electronics, housewares and 2 other extensions, but nodody wants to answer. I finally got through by using the pharmacy extension. They put me through to customer service. Finally, I think I'm getting somewhere. Nope. They tell me that because my item is ordered through a third party, they they will email them and the third party will get back to me in 1 day and that I can't return my package to the store, it has to be sent back to the third party. The third party is in China. Wish me luck. I'm going to need a lot of it.",0,1

Walmart,BUYER BEWARE,"BUYER BEWARE! This is the second time in 2 months this has happened to me, so obviously it's a common practice with WalMart. I WANT TO WARN OTHERS SO THEY DON'T FALL FOR THIS SAME WALMART SCAM. WalMart will advertise a product at a great price so you'll buy it online. They take your money, you'll receive a confirmation email of the order, and a couple of days later you'll receive an email telling you your item has shipped. SURPRISE - the only thing they've done is create a label and sent the label information to FedEx. Your item has NEVER BEEN SHIPPED. After spending an hour speaking to Offshore Reps who can barely speak English and have NO CONCEPT of the difference between creating a label and actually shipping an item, they'll apologize, lie to you about when it will actually get shipped, and tell you to just give it more time. WEEKS after taking your money, after NEVER shipping your order, they'll finally issue you a refund. SCAM SCAM SCAM.",0,1

Called WALMART WHERE WE LIVE IN ZEPHYRHILLS FLORIDA. The lady I spoke with was named Linda. She said we will have them ready for me and can come in on the 28th of November, at 8am. When I got there that morning and they told me they only had one tire available that matched my other tires. I said why? The nice gentleman said he doesn't know why. He then said he can call his manager and I can ask him what happened. The car managers name is George. I asked him why don't I have both tires available for me. I told him I made an appointment approximately 12 days earlier. He said that he has been very busy and Goodyear did not send all of the tires he ordered. I told him that it seemed to me that when I spoke with Linda that they should have been marked with my name on them. He then got very ugly with his tone and said he will cancel my job now or I can put the one tire on now, since I want to continue to argue with him.While waiting, I decided to go into Walmart and ask for the store manager. He's name is Alex. He was very accommodating and apologetic and said he will make sure I have my other tire put on Monday morning at 8am. The tires are finally complete. But, rather than bore you with more complaints I have more that I would like to tell you about George. If you would like to call me and then I can explain more in detail. My cell number is 813-440-9688. Please call me. Thank you, Emeel Shunnarah",1,1

For the next 4 days I went back and forth with Walmart's Chat and email and no one could find this order. Finally, the order was found ""Cancelled"" because the tire was out of stock. Then I was told that I would have to wait 5-10 business days to get my money back. That's really really bad customer service and bad for business! Im sticking to Amazon.",0,1

This has probably ruined me buying things from walmart.com it was just an overall bad experience the package came a week late as well.

Walmart,Walmart Marketplace Online Experience is JUNK,"As Walmart opens it's Marketplace experience to any crappy ""outfit"" their quality is going down the tubes. You USED to have quality products - but unless you select ""Walmart"" as the reseller specifically (and it isn't always offered) - there is no guarantee of quality anymore ordering online. Walmart worked really hard for over 40 years to build their reputation - - whoever is qualifying their online retail partners is obviously more money based than customer based. I don't order from Amazon as its hours of weeding through junk trying to find something simple.

Just because we already paid , it doesn’t mean business is over . ITis not over until our packages are safe at our hands. We buy everything from you even online grocery we do it with you.

It took nearly two hours in total to find this out, even though the local store representatives agreed the proof offered was adequate. There are multiple problems here that need correction at the WalMart organizational level. (1) Poor and incorrect information flow between stores and WalMart,com occurred as different people provided different information, and (2) inadequate or no mechanism to reimburse improperly-collected taxes from tax-exempt organization personnel. Why should we do business with WalMart? This problem needs to be fixed before more federal employees choose to make purchases elsewhere.",0,1

Meanwhile, managers seem to avoid eye contact with customers, silently radiating the message that they can't be bothered to help with anything. I saw one manager at the Woodruff Rd Walmart with her required mask down around her chin and doing no one any good, and she did not put it in its proper place even when she passed within two feet of customers.

In the meantime there’re auto withdrawals being made from our chkg acct for both the original purchase AND the second Unrequested tv. Called cust serv again. Was now told that Walmart hired fedex to pick up the second time, but they wouldn’t pickup because the item was too large.

Was told.. again.. to wait 5 more bus. days and yet ANOTHER frt co would call to schedule a pickup time. We are now over a month into this. I asked to speak to the Walmart cust serv manager’s supervisor ( which is of course at a contracted call ctr in India) , so this could be made right. He told me he was the highest point of contact and that he IS making things right! I told him I’d return the tv to a local Walmart at my expense so I could be refunded. I was told that since it was an online purchase, there was no guarantee of a refund. I would have to wait until a frt co picked it up and scanned it before they would refund the money they took from our chkg acct.

Walmart,Worst company ever,"Worst company ever, Pokémon champions path elite trainer box released, the local store had implemented no social distancing, let some scum cut in front of the line of people who had been waiting there for 7 hours, the girl caused a scene slapping boxes out of my hand after she had already grabbed 3 boxes. The store managers earlier accused me of “harassing” the card stocker who works for a merchandising company. The funny part was that my gf had said to the gentleman “hey, when will you be stocking the shelves, we’ve been waiting for 4 hours and there’s an 80 year old man in a wheelchair that has been waiting since 7 am here” that’s a true story I even filed for a foil of the video. The guys said he would stock the cards in 30 minutes, 2 hours went by still no cards. I approached the gentleman and said “hey man you told us you would have these release day items stocked in 30 minutes, it’s been 2 hours” he said “ I’m busy I’ll do them when I’m done” I then got approached by an associate and a manager, dumb and dumber who said “why are you harassing the merchandiser, he doesn’t even work for Walmart, he feels threatened” I said “ I wasn’t harassing him, we’ve been waiting almost 7 hours for an item that should have been stocked with priority because it’s a release day item” the guys went on to lie and say something and that’s when I made them start stuttering. I said “when the female asked how much longer until he stocked the shelves you didn’t approach her and say stop harassing the merchandiser, but when I ask him hours later now he feels “threatened and harassed because I’m a male” I also followed with “if I have done anything wrong you are more than in the right to tell me to leave the store” they were speechless, they were caught on their bullsh*t. I also said ( and here’s where it gets interesting) I’m going to need that guys employers name and phone number so I can call up and let them know that instead of putting up a priority item, he made 5 customers and an 80 year old man wait 7 hours before he decided to stock the shelves because he was in the back having a good ole time with the Walmart associates. NO JOKE this merchandiser dropped what he was doing in the back and filled the shelves within 5 minutes of me saying that. He knew he was messed up for making everyone wait, he may have even been trying to take it himself.",0,1

Walmart,Ordering online can create headaches,"Ordering online can create headaches. Beware of their third-party sellers, it will be harder to get the right support from them. Some times they don't even ship items properly or pack it well, and it would arrive damaged. I don't believe they should allow other sellers on their website, I feel it degrades their reputation and service towards us. Also, using carriers like Canpar or Purolator for expensive items especially is a drag, because we would have to wait all day long just to make sure they won't leave it by our porch unattended, and not give us notice of their arrival. This happens too often. Got a few of our packages stolen this way. Too bad we can't select which carrier we would like, would make life easier. Either way, it's always best to do your shopping directly in the stores instead of online. More products are available online though, and Walmart always had my back when something didn't go right.

I did not care if they were shipped next day or two day or two weeks. Some items did not qualify for shipping such as brown sugar which is odd because it is a dry good, not a liquid. Some items were next day shipping and some were two day shpping. Instead of being able to place one order for all of the items, I had to 'save' the two day shipping items, then place the order for only items that were next day. then go back in and place an order for only items that were two days. Seriously? If I order from Amazon or Barnes and Noble, I place one order regardless of the length of time to ship. So, in splitting the order, 1) it was a sheer hassle, 2) I did not qualify for free shipping on the second order 3) my credit card company thought it was a fraud.

Very unhelpful!She kept saying I wonder how I can make this up to you! And yet she never did!Knowing how shots are given I knew something the Pharmacist failed to do was going to cause problems and it has. The manager didn't know the process and to defend her pharmacist she resulted in lying.She mentioned that they have an option of needle sizes, the flu shot is only in your arm and they do not have to squeeze your shoulder unless they choose to. Everyone sane and families know that the flu shots are in your shoulder, the should do have to be squeezed and the size of the needle depends on the size of the person. Example: Needles used for adults are never the same for babies.Unfortunately, I had to go to another Pharmacy-only this time at Target and exactly what I thought, this Pharmacist said the same thing.Since FLU Shots are normally given in the shoulder and since this Pharmacist failed to squeeze my shoulder, the needle may have gone in too far and hit the bone!I received a call from the Store Manager and he didn't do anything either.He also never contacted me back after speaking to someone in Wellness. I AM NOW SURE THAT I WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER FLU SHOT AND IF I EVER BECOME THAT DUMB AGAIN, MY SHOT WILL NOT COME FROM WALMART!

Later I found out it was because they did not want to protect against bots buying hundreds of PS5s because walmart is more intent on making a profit than making their customers happy (it is simple to prevent this, and they even use tools to prevent that when you try to write a review for a product).

Walmart,WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD,"WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE! I accidentally ordered 3 of the same thing online on 11.13.20, well, I was able to get to the first one on time and push ""refund"" so that it wouldnt go through but the second one, I didnt get to in time. The second one showed ""pending return"" and then gave me a barcode to give to a Walmart Associate (as it said); so what do i do, I go to Walmart and show them my Walmart App and that it says to give this ""barcode"" to them. I saw the barcode thing on 11.14.20 but I didnt end up going to Walmart till yesterday (11.19.20), as this was the day I got my order delivered and I had to go to Walmart anyways. So, when I was at Walmart on 11.19.20, I ended up having 3 people help me because they had no idea what is was that was going on with the ""pending return"". So, the Walmart associate stated a Chat with Walmart on my phone app and was talking with a Sham (Chat # 20119-82664-2008-0000 / 5:14PM on 11.19.20) and he didnt help at all. All he kept talking about was the one that got delivered to me. Which she told him, yes, i got one delivered but they charged me twice on my account (which i noticed that morning, so i thought the going to walmart because of the ""pending return"" would refund that money but that wasnt the case at all). So, we finally get him to talk about the pending return and he states, I need to return the item and then I will get a refund. This is when i started to get angry because I didnt have that second item delivered in the first place. This is when he states that the item is actually being delivered. At this point, I was sure this guy had no idea what he was talking about. The Walmart associate then stated on the chat that it only said the pending return, there was no, delivered, pending delivery, processing or tracking number or anything like that. So we asked him for the tracking number, as I was not going to end the chat without one, I needed proof that this item was actually coming my way since I paid for it. He then sent it to me and then ended the chat without us saying anything much after that; the Walmart associate was shocked when he did that (seemed sketchy). We looked at the tracking number, it was the exact same as the one i already got delivered to me. Then we noticed that on the app, it didnt say ""pending return"" anymore, it stated ""DELIVERED"". Like whaaaaaat!!!! Its like they charged me for two items but put everything on one order. At this point, I was pissed. By the way, its the next day and I still havent received this supposedly delivered 2nd item. Hmmmmm.....So the walmart associate had me call 1-800-WALMART. This guy was amazing along with the Walmart Associate that helped me at the sore. I wish i remembered her name but Jose was the guy on the phone. He sent me a refund. This morning, i noticed I was charged again; I was charged now, 3 times for 1 item. I will never order online again. I did get get a refund for that extra charge but I had to beg and cry for it. Never ordering online again!! First and last time.",0,1

It’s just not worth the headache! On October 9th I ordered a bed frame and a mattress. I received the bed frame, no problem. When it came to my mattress, they sent me a baby crib instead. I have no children. I have no need for a crib. Now I’ve spoken to about 10 different people all of whom had different accents most of which I could not understand. All of the customer service agents tell you everything that you want to hear but do nothing to actually help the situation. Although they make you think it is all taken care of until it’s been over a month of frustration. I finally canceled my order and now I’m fighting to get my refund. I’ve spoken to 3 “higher ups” non of which are helpful in getting my refund. Because instead of refunding the item that I never got they refunded me the item I did receive, probably because it was less expensive. So now I’m waiting to hear back from someone in billing accounts. I swear I HATE THIS COMPANY AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Greed has taken over our society and has put humanitarianism as a last resort. I will never shop at their stores nor will I ever buy any product from their on line store. This should not be that difficult. It doesn’t help that everyone is a third party someone and no one knows what’s going on.

They said no and that somehow the consoles in stock were mainly for online orders. The online orders were not a option if you were paying attention. They basically blew me off and were not being understanding. I dont care if it was management corporate or whatever, why even bother telling me theyre in stock, when they are already reserved.

They did good. 4 star could be warranted since the trouble I went through however with the ending treatment from the management i believe a 5 star is warranted considering black friday does make it super busy and mistakes can be made. 5 star earned since they proved why walmart has earned its right to be on top in the industry.",0,5

I received several canceled emails, because of limitations on the item (even though the Playstation 5 page said nothing about limitation per customer...support just told me it did). I have the page saved, and NO where does it say limit 1 per customer. Anyways, I called my credit card company, and they said all but 1 were canceled by Wal-Mart, which was cool. I really just wanted 1 or 2 (an extra for a friend of Christmas present for my nephew). In the mean time, my girlfriend that lives in the same house as me (a separate customer) was able to get one on her own debit card, and Wal-Mart called her and emailed her to see if it was legit, and of course she said it was. I wasn't able to see if they've canceled her order or not, but I'm receive ZERO Playstation 5's when I did absolutely nothing wrong, and I received confirmation emails, and they went far enough through to reach my credit card. Support said they can't do anything to help me, and I won't be home on Black Friday to try and get one then, so I'm out of luck. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the first support rep I spoke to tonight flat out hung up on me, because he wouldn't let me tell him my side of the story, and he thought he was the only one that should be allowed to talk. Anyways, be careful if you use the 'saved for later' option when checking out, as you may be flagged for fraudulent activity, receive no call or email, and you will NOT receive the item you are ordering. I still don't understand how my girlfriend receives a phone call to see if her order was legit or not, but I receive nothing. I will be leaving a review on BBB, as well.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart can substitute a different iPhone in place of the one you ordered,"I ordered an IPHONE 12 PRO MAX SILVER 256GB on the first day of the PreOrder (11/6). Order # 5822058-373752.Looks like Walmart distribution center ran out of that version, so they decided to send a comparable replacement:IPHONE 12 PRO MAX PACIFIC BLUE 128GBThat is NOT a good comparable replacement!! This is ridiculous.I talked with a customer service rep and they said there is nothing they can do. They acted a bit annoyed that I wasn't satisfied with what I got, because it was on backorder and some people can't even get the PACIFIC BLUE 128GB version.I argued that the 128GB is not even the same price as the 256GB and the rep said the only thing they can do on their end is to let me send it back and I would get a refund in 4 to 6 days after they received the phone back, as long as it's in unused, unopened condition and then I can reorder another one, but that currently there is a three to four week wait on the MAX SILVER 256GB.Outraged I told the rep that I ordered it on the first day of the PreOrder so that I would have it on launch day, not have to wait until 5 to 6 weeks after the launch date. I asked to speak with a manager, they left and came back after a few minutes and said that they don't have a manager available to talk to me right now. I insisted and asked them to try again. They tried again and returned after a few minutes and said that a manager would call me back within two hours.It's been long past two hours and no one has called me back. I have been buying the iPhone for everyone in my family since the iPhone 3GS. Walmart has given the worst purchase experience ever, by far in ordering an iPhone. Nightmare service.

Walmart,Is it possible to get 1 order right? Just 1,"EVERYTHING about walmart.com his horrendous. We live in a small town that has no other stores to shop at. Walmart is the only store we can get presents for our kids during holidays. EVERY time I order something goes wrong. I have orders I never received, orders that were supposed to be next day that came 2 weeks later, I even had an order last Christmas that never made it to me. When I called Walmart they told me they could not give me information because it was someone elses order. I paid for it, it was on my account, but for some reason the warehouse sent it to someone else and never sent another package to me because it was not my order. Now I have started my kids Christmas shopping so I can break it up over 2 months, and my order is flagged so the fraud department can verify it. They didn't call me to verify, didn't ask me to verify it was me who ordered it, just flagged it. SO now I am told if I want it, I have to cancel it and wait 5-10 business days to get the money back and order again. SERIOUSLY? Can you get 1 order right? Just 1 order thats all I am asking for. I spend close to $200 a day at the store and this is how we are treated? I may need to think about going into town to shop, I really don't want to give a company all this money when they cannot help out when things go wrong.",0,1

Walmart,This review is of the Walmart Chat Feature,"I have used the Walmart Chat feature in connection with a couple bad experiences with the Grocery Delivery-Pick up. In each instance, the person in the Chat was friendly and professional. It is easy to select which is the order of concern so they can look up all the information on that order. In both cases, I received refunds right at that time. One instance was an order that was never delivered and I had to pick up on my own the next day. They refunded the delivery fee to me.The other instance, was an Express Order, for which you pay extra. There must have been some glitch in the app, because just a few minutes after placing the order, I received a notice that it was on its way, but the location was a different state. I then looked at my order status and that was correct, so I ignored the first. Then I received a notice that my order had been delivered, but it had not been left at my door. I had been waiting for it, so I would have known if they had come and I also have a Ring Doorbell, so I would have seen or recorded anyone coming to the front door.The delivery was supposedly at 7:53 pm. I called the store and was told that the grocery folks leave at 8:00 pm, so no one was answering when I was transferred to them. If they are going to have deliveries into the evening, they should not close until they know deliveries were made. I was told to wait until the morning to call back.I decided to try the chat feature again. I had to wait a bit, but the agent was able to identify the driver and said the photo take was not helpful. I basically think someone just decided to keep my order as the photo really wasn't even an attempt to take a picture of items on a step or porch. It was mostly black with a vague object in it. I was refunded for my entire order during this chat. Their Chat feature works well.",0,4

The email received instructs go to the to pickup area click a link via the App or the Text message received. Nothing worked. I land at the pick up area where I was told to go inside to pick up. I go inside to pick up where the people who got items on the BF day deals are standing waiting for someone to show up. About 10 minutes later someone shows up and scans are email barcodes, and informs drive to the outdoor department area. I drive over only to find that Walmart cornered off turn so to get into the BF parking slots one has to exit Walmart onto the main road then U-Turn and enter from the car service department entrance. Why not just state this in the email for the select store so 45 minutes of my life is not wasted. Sadly, the good Black Friday deals scored get ruined by the pick up process.",0,2

Walmart,Absolutely horrible experience,"Absolutely horrible experience. Ordered a $379 laptop and was given a $250 laptop by the store i picked it up from. When I noticed this they couldn't process a refund right away due to computer issues and I had to come back the next day. I was credited for the lower priced laptop and the associate had to spend about 20 mins on the phone with other staff to hopefully credit me the remaining amount, which i have yet to receive a confirmation on such as an email. Besides that, I did not get the item I wanted to buy and it is no longer in stock. One store associate tried to make it right by offering me a giftcard and I appreciate that, but my time is more valuable than $20 and I would appreciate it more if they could get the order right the first time.

She goes to the layaway department to get her money back but comes back to me with tears in her eyes. They had only gave her $2 back of the $50 she had on the tablet. Turns out there's been some changes to the fine print of Walmart layaway which allows them to keep most of your money in the event you choose to terminate it.

I spoke to a manager there to try to find a way to feed my family for a week since Walmart wasn’t able to fill my order and is holding my money.

I am a frequent customer for online ordering and expected to be treated with more understanding and respect. I have worked in customer service for nearly 10 years and I have never seen/received such poor service, management, and helplessness, especially from such a large corporation.

I was asked to come up to the register. I gave my name and birthdate and asked for a prescription that was texted in and received a message it was ready to be picked up. The cashier asked me to go to the drop off window. I did there wasn't anyone else working there. The cashier then left to go out in the aisles to help a woman find baby oil , then she used her phone. I went and asked her if other people were ahead of me. She stated that she was done at 6 , and that there was people ahead of me. She then told me my prescriptions was not ready and I would have to come back. I told her that I needed it then and would wait. She said loudly that she would have to put it in as a emergency and asked me if I would like that. I told her I needed it. ( I do need it for my entire life). She then had it filled. I left feedback with Walmart of my experience. After that I received a call from the pharmacy about it. This made me very uncomfortable, and now it is very awkward to go there. My insurance pays thousands of dollars to Walmart for my needed prescriptions. I feel like I need to go to a different place now because of the awkwardness going there.

Walmart,"Walmart, yet again disappointing customers with foolish sales practices on PS5 and Xbox Series X.","Walmart and other retailers have dropped the ball on the Xbox Series X and Playstation 5 launch.Knowing that bots are making purchases before actual gamers and families trying to secure a device, they still continue to make these items online only. I'd like to know who is over the entire Walmart sales team because they are not that bright. i know of several locations that have stock on hand and they refuse to sell them stating that they are for their Black Friday sale only. That's a dumb decision, since the scalpers will be ready when those items go live. I realize that Walmart, other retailers, Sony and Microsoft do not care who purchases an item as long as it's purchased, but this shows no loyalty whatsoever to customers at all. I wish that we could stop shopping collectively at all of their locations for a few weeks to see how that would affect their bottom line. Let them see if scalpers would be willing to purchase all of their everyday items from Walmart to keep them afloat.

Huge bummer. Customer service was a huge headache. I was on the phone for over 40 minutes. I could barely understand the lady. Apparently they sold out of the bike we ordered so they put a different one that was the same price but not comparable at all. They want me to now drive to return it.

It was awful. Now I have to keep trying to get it for my grandson. What happened to just putting it on a shelf and people going to the store and waiting in line to get it. I know it's a pandemic but you can still wait in line 6 ft apart at least you know where you stand.",0,1

Walmart,BLACK FRIDAY SCAM FALSE ADVERTISING AND PHISHING,"I waited all year to buy a TV because I knew they would go on sale for black Friday. Iciar Walmart had their BLACK FRIDAY ad for a 55 "" Smart tv for $148.00 starting at 7 PM online only. I was online at 6:30 waiting until it was available to place in my cart and as soon as I placed it in my cart I immediately tried to pay for it and i received a message that said it was out of stock at 7:01. I tried the online chat with Walmart 2 no avail. I called corporate Walmart and they said that I should open an account with Walmart online. I explained to them that I did have an account online although it take several minutes of him talking over me for him to listen. Then he said I should have been faster than I was. I threatened him with a class action lawsuit and posting our conversation to Facebook and he hung up on me. At it kills me that they are still advertising these TV's that they do not have. So I rate them as zero as well.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart’s Black Friday “deals” are abysmal!,"I tried to purchase a TCL 55"" Roku Smart TV that went on sale at Walmart on 11/11/20 at 7:00pm. Although I attempted to make the purchase right when the sale started, I received an out of stock message. Looking through deal sites later that night I found out that for most people, the “deal” was gone in 60 seconds or less. I also found out, too late, that Walmart then “magically” found more stock of this TV at 7:30, 8:00, and 8:30 that evening. At 10:04 the next morning their website indicated that there were 94 available, but when I tried to add one to my cart I was told that it was out of stock. When I went back to the main page, it still said that there were 94 available. At 3:29 that afternoon the main page indicated that 83 were available, but the same thing happened. At 9:30 that night I was actually able to add it to my cart, but when I tried to check out, surprisingly it was out of stock. Immediately afterwards I was able to add it to my cart again, with the same result...rinse and repeat. At 10:31pm the website showed that the TV was available for pickup locally, but the “add to cart” was gone. Even though this TV is clearly unavailable, Walmart has the nerve to continue to prominently feature it on their “Black Friday Deals for Days” page (“Deals for Seconds” would be more accurate). This experience has really soured my opinion of Walmart. They obviously only obtained a token stock of this TV that they featured so prominently, and then distributed their miniscule stock in a staggered way that was very unfair to those who attempted to purchase the item when it was scheduled to go on sale. To then rub salt in the wound, their website has repeatedly indicated that the TV was available when it wasn’t. This is in stark contrast to the very positive Black Friday experiences I’ve had at Best Buy and Home Depot. Walmart offering deals that they have no intention of honoring is an awful way to treat their customers. I greatly resent Walmart’s sales practices, their poorly managed website, and the time I’ve wasted pursuing this rigged “deal”. From the many concerns I’ve seen expressed here and at other sites, my experience is not an isolated incident. I suggest that in the future, we direct our time and money elsewhere.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart.com Review,"I did an online order on November 3rd mmfor an item and they shipped it on the 9th of November. It has been sitting pretty in Houston since then. Here's the thing, I live less than 6 hours away and have not received the item yet AND its to be delivered on the 20th? This is the second time I have ordered something from them and it took forever to get here. I think next time, I will just order from Amazon. They guarantee 2 day delivery or within a weeks time. I have ordered stuff for my daughter who lives in a different state and she gets shipment quicker. Not pleased with Walmart.com",0,3
Walmart,Pay to ship. Pay to return.,"I ordered a chair for $27.00 from Walmart.com. The chair was not to my liking, so I started going through the process of returning the item, in-store. I could not because I checked out as a guest and the chair was purchased though a “market dealer”. This required me to go through a third party to return my item via mail. They said I could but I had to pay shipping. I paid $15 to ship the chair to me, they required me to pay another $15 to ship the damn thing back, all for me to get a refund of $27. There solution was giving me a 15% discount on the item I purchased and didn’t want. A billion dollar company can’t let me return an item in store, I have to pay for shipping to get the item and return the item, and I have to keep an item I don’t want. I literally just gave Walmart $44. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS.",0,1

Walmart,Black Friday TV deal Scams,"I agree with all the folks on here about how the Black Friday deals now for 2020 regarding the TV’s are a scam. You literally can’t buy them online. If you did purchase one you were one of the lucky few and I mean very few. Both TV’s sell out in under a minute. Even if you get it in your cart you can’t buy it. Super sad because I believe Walmart wants you to then buy something else since you’re there which I did not, although others may have. The reality is that they promised TV’s for two weeks and have lied (just read this in other reviews I can only vouch for this week). Now folks are going to be waiting in lines for hours on Black Friday risking their lives in the pandemic trying to grab one in store. Nope not me I never do the Walmart mob it’s time to go home to Target where I belong.",0,1

Walmart,WALMART DOESN'T CARE,This isn't the first time I've had issues with Walmart and ordering things. I didn't go to sleep last night camping out to get a Xbox series x only to be told in the morning that a person had decided to now get the last series x so i was out of luck.. But my wife ( who's pregnant) was kinda sad so she suggested i look into Walmart as they had been promoting they would have a launch at noon so i made a profile put my credit card info in and my friend did the same for a location in his state. As soon as 12 noon hit i hit purchase as soon as i could and by some stroke of luck ( i thought) i had gotten my order processed. I had beaten the bots.. My wife literally came and gave me a high five.. My friend had also had one available in North Carolina but since Walmart took my money and told me it was processed their was no reason to pursue it..i was so happy.. 2 hrs later while I'm day dreaming about my console i get a text saying your order has been cancelled by Walmart.. My stomach drops.. At this point there's no chance i can find the consoles that were available earlier..i check my bank account no refund yet. And just as i go to check my order on the Walmart app i get the text of my m reversal. So you took my money which didn't allow me to possibly shop elsewhere during a period where timing was crucial. Then after holding my money for hrs I'm the one on the short end of the stick.. i don't know if it's because i didn't get any sleep last night or what but this really stings.. Maybe I'm over reacting but I'm m beyond frustration and today's emotional roller coaster.. Worse part is I've tried twice now to get to a supervisor for Walmart.com first time they put me on hold for 20 min then transferred me to a random stores electronics.. i called back and asked for another supervisor and was told I'd get a call in 30 min.. It's now been 75 min. This is not how you do your customers Walmart or at least you shouldn't,0,1

Walmart,I had the WORST experience with Walmart…,I had the WORST experience with Walmart both In store and online. On Nov 4th I placed an order for a tv that was on sale for Black Friday. When I picked up my order today the tv was broken. I called Walmart.com customer service to see what could be done and they explained to me that I would need to go in store to exchange. When I got in store they told me that they could return it but it was an online order only and the only thing they can do is return the item and that I needed to call Walmart.com for a replacement. I called Walmart.com again waited 30 minutes on hold and was disconnected. I called again and after another 30 minutes I finally spoke to manager Hans who told me that this was considered a store order and that the replacement would need to come from the store shelves. I explained to the manager that the store told me that this comes from the Walmart.com warehouse and it was never on store shelves. He told me that I was”lied to” in store. This is absolutely unacceptable. There needs to be better communication between online and in store. It seems like no one knew what they were talking about. Long story short a replacement tv was never given after a 4 hour ordeal. I would not recommend ANYONE to use the Black Friday sales option online because if something is wrong with it there are no replacements.,0,1

As there was not another customer in sight I was not about to walk 200 yards just get on the other side of the tape so I could enter the store to spend my money so I ducked under it. Wow, a mistake. Immediately a Walmart employee and two off duty security cops blocked my way and told me that I could not do that - I must walk around! I asked them if they really thought I was stupid enough to walk 200 yards just so I, the customer,could spend my money when there was not another single customer in sight? Apparently they thought so so I left. I called the manager and she seemed pretty much clueless also. I then called corporate customer service and talked to a lady who seemed to have some common sense.

By the way, I bought diapers, dr. brown bottle nipples, dr. brown bottle handle and baby oil for my baby. Now, trying to get a replacement which is not possible, they offered refund, the problem is I used the gift card and threw away because once the payment method goes thorough the system, approved, I do not need the info again, well lesson learned, save the freaking card until you get your product otherwise yo are going to lose your money for companies like Walmart. I can't get a refund because I don't have the gift card anymore! $50 gone! no product! no money back! I truly will do everything possible not to buy anything from this company, we are cancelling our credit card (Walmart) and going to give and tell always a negative review about this company.

Boasting for days about the Black Friday and Pre-Black Friday online sale of 65"" Roku tvs and 42"", yet as soon as you log on at the appointed time, you receive a message, ""Out of Stock."" How can you be out of stock online when the sale just started one second ago?! There is no way they had any intentions on selling these tvs at the price advertised. It was just a ploy to get you on their website to buy other products! I can't stand deceit!",0,1
Walmart,I tried to get the black friday sale on…,I tried to get the black friday sale on the 65inch tv onn . i had it in my cart it was not there. I looked up it again said it was not online nomore to get at store.

Walmart,Walmart Owners aren't concerned with Their Customer,"I waited 15 minutes in a line-up today. Walmart's customers spend huge amounts of money in their stores daily. Walmart could easily afford to have every cash register manned by two people during all of their opening hours and not lose money. It is inexcusable that Walmart customers spend anymore than a five minutes while waiting for a cash register.Walmart is solely concerned about their profit margins. They 'kicked out some cash' to install self-service terminals complete with cameras in their Langley, B.C. location. How thoughtful. So we as customers pay for the pleasure of doing the work of a cashier for Walmart. We unload the items, scan all our products through, bag our groceries, load them in the buggy and process the payment! We even get to pay for our own bags after all that work! Thankfully, Walmart knows enough about profit margins to realize that the self-service terminals are more cost effective and are cheaper than having an employee operating a cash register. Why pay a cashier when the customer will do it for free? The self check outs were not installed with the customer in mind ... simply installed because it was financially beneficial for them.I emphasize the term 'experience' here based on WHAT the ""Walmart"" owners and ""WALMART shareholders"" do to ensure that 'my customer service experience' is not exceptional.THEY DO Very little. I'm sure that Walmart will be quick to respond to my review with a predictable statement like, ""Our customers have been asking us to increase the 'self-check out options in our stores' and we were honouring their requests and customers by installing them"". Let's be honest here, self-check out is more cost effective than paying an employee minimum wage.Today, customers were primarily standing in line to check out with an under paid 'human being' manning a cash register. Canadians waiting in line for a cashier do so to support a fellow Canadian and keep them employed even if it is in a minimum wage job.Walmart makes unimaginable profit margins. Well done! Your profits will increase because of the self-service tills! I abhor Walnut's mantra and practice of running their staff as LEAN as they can with skeletal staffing.My experience as a customer today and many other times proves to me that they run their stores with leanest of staffing. Owners aren't concerned with how long I stand in a line-up, nor how much flack their UNDER PAID and UNDER VALUED employees receive from disgruntled customers because of the owner's antiquated and inept staffing decisions. It's all about the profits and numbers! It should be about valuing a customer. A customer who keeps your profit margins more than healthy. In the future, if I do shop at Walmart again, any wait time in excess of 3 minutes is inexcusable. My shopping cart with $300 worth of product in it will be left for one of their under paid employees to put away, or wait a minute maybe they could install a self service terminals to return the items ....",0,1

They have no moral conscience or business plan except to wealth. Who cares what we are going through as a country? Who cares about black lives? Or hungry children in America? GO AHEAD put those GUNS back on the shelf so you look like a proper political player. These are the very people running our country into the ground. Walmart is a pathetic dinosaur of a business model. Let them bleed like the Trump Klan when this struggle for fascist power is turned over to the people. This is our country America!

The next day go to track order and it said delayed. We waited till today to contact them and we were told that none of our items were even filled. They are claiming they have none of the items in stock. All they can do is refund our money they already took which takes 5 business day which means we might receive it next week. She than proceeds to tell us we are the 4th customer she has had to do this with. Sadly this is the second time they did this to us. The first time my bank account was in the negative and I had to pay for that. I will never again use walmart online. They are a joke.,0,1

Walmart,Buyer beware of Walmart.com return…,"Buyer beware of Walmart.com return policy:Purchased a phone for our dad, in his 70’s and the phone while fitting his budget was to small for him to read. Went to return the phone which is a third-party phone handled by Walmart.com. We were told at the Lapeer, Walmart to contact Walmart.com because they would have to issue a return shipping label to be picked up at any Walmart store. During the telephone conversation with a Walmart.com representative we were told that we could bring the phone to a Walmart store to return the phone although we would have to package it, and the store would print up the return label. This is not true. The commercial being run by Walmart is a lie. At best only certain items can be returned. After two unsuccessful trips to the Lapeer store, we were told that the order number could not be found and that we would have to return the phone ourselves. I suggest that you stay with a top company and shop Amazon or pay for the prime membership. With Amazon prime at least you will get what you pay for. NO more shopping for my wife and I on Walmart.com if it is a third party item and likely we will stay with a company we can count on, that being Amazon.",0,1

Then when a manger finally delivered our order, several items were listed as ""not available"" even though they were listed as ""in Stock"" when we ordered. We will never use this service again, and we are not wild about the idea of even shopping at Wal Mart again. This use to be a great store, but it has gone to complete garbage.",0,1
Walmart,Abysmal,"Wal-Mart's site is abysmal. Once a go-to for anything new, whether it was a game or a movie, or even a bit more expensive media, is now a wreck. Exclusive items are bought in seconds by Ebayers because they're allowed a 'minimum' of twelve. Wow, that's all? Just twelve? There is seemingly no more site to store. If my local store didn't have an item I wanted I could have it shipped to my local store. Maybe this feature is still available, but the last few items I've been interested in have not give me this option. Also, some items online are cheaper than the store, but there is a catch. Recently I wanted to buy Saints Row the 3rd: Remastered for the PS4. The site had it for 19.99, while my local store was sold out. I couldn't have it sent to the store minus shipping so it ultimately costs you almost ten dollars more anyway. I don't see why i couldn't have had it shipped to my store. When I called the rep tried to tell me this policy varies from state to state, which is utter nonsense. It's a company. There are no state by state regulations. Making excuses is one thing, but lying is quite another. The last straw was when I tried to cancel a pre-order because of these other issues. I just didn't want a dragged out mess in the event something came up. I tried cancelling and the pending authorization stayed on for over a week, as well as the pre-order, even though I'd cancelled it; as if they refused to cancel it or the system was being glitchy, who knows. I ended up just closing my online account and taking my business to Gamestop. When you get passed over for Gamestop you know you've screwed up. Not to mention a few of the reps being downright rude when asking about the simplest issues. They'll just leave the chat for whatever reason. Whatever happened to Wal-Mart is not good. They may not have been perfect but they've turned into a flea market for third-party sellers, Ebayers, and shady business practices. I can't be the only one these type incidents has happened to. get back to the basics. Oh, and stop using the PS5 and Series X in your Black Friday ads. You know damn well they won't be available (or discounted). Liars.",0,1

Big red flag but its Sunday and I need a tire. Then a few hours later i get a call from an assistant manager named Robert that I'm missing a lug nut. WAIT WHAT I know I'm not missing a lug nut because I pulled the hub cap off with the intent of just putting on the doughnut before deciding to just take it in. To add insult to injury he tells me that the post is stripped. So they loose one of my lugs strip the post trying to put some other nut on to replace it and the solution is to ask me to sign a waiver to hold them not liable if something happens. Never Never Never go to a Walmart Auto Center just don't. Pay extra and get it fixed at a tire shop.,0,1
Walmart,Walmart Does Not Pack Items Shipped Properly,"First of all, if I could rate Walmart online delivery service with a rating of zero or a negative number, I would do so. We have made four different orders with Walmart. On each order, without fail, some product or another burst open, spilling contents all over the inside of the shipping box and on the other items purchased. The items which burst were: Nestle's Quik, Cascade Dishwasher Detergent, Peter Pan Peanut Butter, and Hershey's Cocoa. Each time, there was no bubble wrap or other material surrounding the items inside. Thus, the items inside the shipping box banged around breaking the other items. Further, the shipping box, each time, was not sealed, because they do not place enough tape to seal the shipping box. My wife and I will not use Walmart shipping service again; we will not buy from Walmart. This is sad and ironic because we are Walmart shareholders.",0,1

Walmart,They ship the wrong item and make correction very difficult,"Ordered an 8' table. Received a laptop table. Called to get replacement. Was told order for replacement was placed and would arrive by Nov 12, 2.5 weeks. Told to take wrong item to store for return. Then received an email saying replacement can't be shipped until wrong product returned and return cannot be made at store. Shipping label attached to email was incomprehensible. Needed table for Thanksgiving and ordered on Oct 12 so plenty of time. Now I have no idea as to whether or not I will have the items by the time I need it and it is all their mistake.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart auto service,"Walmart auto service - When asked them to fix my tire with patch, they put me last in the queue.

Walmart,This online store sucks,I have tried to return a recliner now 6 times through the customer service and I have to say when u have someone on the phone they have to be the dumbest of divest people on there. They get in touch with the carrier they use for returns to pick up items and they tell u they will show between a certain time and it’s been over a week and I’m still waiting for this recliner to be picked up now it’s been over two weeks. This is RIDICULOUS....... a blind man in a wheelchair could’ve done my return faster than these guys. I will NEVER do an online order EVER AGAIN with Walmart anything I need I will go into the store or get an online order from AMAZON. THE WORST experience I’ve ever had with Walmart. Next time we call for a return just tell the customer I’m to stupid to help and I don’t know how to do anything. That will make things go a lot easier and smoother.,0,1

Went back with my receipt, and was told the only way to get the difference was to bring the battery in the store by manager. Battery was in the car I drove to the store. Called cooperate and was told it's at managers discretion. Ask what if it was a 55"" T.V. and was told the same thing would apply. That's what I call False Advertising. At other stores if a item goes on sale ,all you have to do is bring in your receipt. Good thing it wasn't tires. No more of my money going to WALMART.",0,1

Walmart,10/24/20,"10/24/20, 3-4ish pm. Store #00576 located at 207 S Memorial Dr, Tulsa, Ok...manager ""Seth"", store employee ""Josh"", a person that stands around at the entrances inside, talking to other employees & not paying any attention to customers entering the store, nor their needs. I just cant figure out what in the world his job might be other than, as previously said, talk, laugh with other employees at the inside entrances & totally ignore customers as they come in. What is the job of these individuals hanging around the inside entrances anyway?....well based on my experiences & observations...their jobs must be to catch up on the latest activities of each other & social media. There's one guy, his name is Josh, that hangs around the front doors that refuses to wear his mask properly. When I asked him why not, his answer was because he's not sick...& when discussed further about the rising numbers of people getting sick & dieing, he shrugged & said, oh well it's not his problem & he doesnt care. WHAT?!!!! In this day when Ok has almost $1,200 new CoVid-19 cases, PER DAY, we have this defiant, uncaring, inconsiderate person that doesnt care whether he might be spreading CoVid-19 to any of the customers that come through Walmart's doors. I was horrified & disgusted at the cavalier attitude...it's people like Josh that are helping to put so many people in the hospital & to those that may die. Yes, I asked to speak to the store manager...which was Seth that came to speak to me. I explained my concerns about Josh's defiant & uncaring attitude & about Walmart's laid back attitude on CoVid-19. Seth said he would talk to Josh. Within the next 30-40 minutes, in the course of my shopping, I went by the front door area several times, where Josh was working (& I use that word loosely) & I would see Josh still not wearing his mask properly. I talked to Seth, the manager, several times about Josh & he would tell me he hadn't talked to Josh yet...Why not? This is about public health! Instead Josh continued to hang out & talk to his fellow employees & the customers as a potential covid spreader. Walmart used to have simple & to the point signs around the outside entrances telling people to wear masks when shopping. In fact, they used to have someone standing outside the entrances stopping people that were not wearing masks & offering one to them. Now they do still have a few signs but they are very unassuming & wordy to the extent that no customer is going to stop from going in to try to find these essential signs, much less to take 5 minutes to stand there, look for them & to read them. I'm guessing the financial bottom line, became more important than public health. Really? Walmart is such a pillar of the community...they should be examples to those that shop there....to the community...to be leaders in our fight against CoVid-19. Come on Walmart!...stand up & be counted as one of the good guys! & enforce your mask policy (especially within your own ranks of employees) & if the employee blatantly refuses to care about representing Walmart properly or has such an uncaring attitude about customers, they need to move along & let someone else that really needs a job & will be a team Walmart player have a chance. I am extremely stressed & irritated at the thought of shopping at this store again!",0,1

Walmart,This week,"This week, I used Walmart Delivery for the 1st time and it will be my last. I was injured, so I'm unable to go to my local store. I rarely go there anyway, due to how poorly run it is and how the staff is too interested with what is on the phones, than maintaining the store, but that's an entirely different story. Anyway, I selected the items that I needed from that stores inventory. All items were in stock, so I added the 15 items to my cart, paid and got the delivery date ( Friday 10/23/20). All seemed pretty painless. Then I get an email, letting me know that my order was being sent to me in 3 different packages. Seemed odd, since the store was like 5 miles away and all the items were in stock, but whatever. I then received an email, stating that the delivery dates were going to be on 10/21/20, 10/22/20and 10/23/20. Ok, still nothing to get upset about. The package to be delivered on the 21st, was coming from the local store, the 2nd one was coming from a store about 40 minutes away and the 3rd from another state. I get an email on the morning of the 21st, letting me know that my local package was ""out for delivery"" and to expect it by ""end of day"". Well, the end of day came and went and the order status was changed to ""Delayed"". The end of day on the 22nd came and went...no status change....about 5pm on the 23rd, still no package and still just the ""Delayed"" status, so I contacted customer service, to see about an updated status for that local package. After a bit of a wait, she comes back to let me know that the package got lost in delivery ( yes, they somehow lost my package, in the 10 minute drive from the store to my house). Results: I had to cancel 1 package that contained over 1/2 my order( and now 2 of the items are ""out of stock"") and at the time of writing this, I'm still waiting on the other 2 packages. I tried to give it a shot, but I'm sticking with Amazon.",0,1

Walmart,Bad Customer Service and Money Theft,"I ordered a desk online at the beginning of September, but they weren't tracking inventory apparently and ran out. No big deal - I went to cancel it because I found one that would actually get to me elsewhere.I contacted customer support to cancel the order and was told they ""can't"" cancel it because it's ""processing"" and to wait 48-72 hours. I told them I'd been waiting about two months and they just kept repeating that before disconnecting with me. I followed this up with a phone call and the man I spoke to said he'd cancel the order... but he didn't.So now my cash is in limbo, my item STILL hasn't even SHIPPED yet (most places will cancel orders if they haven't been shipped) and they won't cancel the order OR give me information as to who the seller is so I can directly contact them. Basically, they stole $100 from me (:UPDATE: they took no action until I filed a complaint with BBB. It is November 8th and the item still hasn't shipped. I am talking to them about getting this resolved now. Regardless, their customer service needs to do better. It should've been resolved when I reached out the first time - the fact that I had to escalate this issue to even BEGIN to get assistance is ridiculous.",0,1

There were some items at the beginning of COVID that Walmart had that no other online order and delivery service offered.. These were some monthly items that were fulfilled quickly and accurately, at first. Then, somewhere in July or August the service fulfillment took a turn for the worse. Started with an Item that I specified the details about and they sent a similar item that I specified not to send as a replacement in case they were out. They sent the item I said not to replace with. I got onlinelchat, they apologized and sent a new one. I opened the box and presto, it was exactly the same incorrect item. I cancelled the order and went to the online service with the big 'A' and got what I wanted.The latest was my monthly order,that my e-mail said would be delivered the next day. It wasn't. I contaced support. They apologized as they are told to do and gave me a delivery time 48 hours later. They never said why it did not arrive. 48 hours later, the delivery never came. I contacted support, they apologized and told me the shipping label had been created but the shipment never loaded onto the deliver truck, They gave me 48 hours for it to arrive. 48 hours later it still did not arrive so I contacted support. They apologized. They told me that the shipment was 'LOST in TRANSPORT'. That's it. 'Lost in transport.' They tried to give me 48 hours delay. I said no, cancelled the order. I went to the online service with the big 'A' and found that they now had the product AND for $8 less and no minimum purchase for free shipping as I have a membership. So I have said farewell to Walmart and wonder if the shareholders and management are trying to lose business to that other mega Online company and wait until Walmart goes Belly up.

Walmart,NO MORE WASTING TIME,"I live in North Idaho, do not drive at night and especially in bad weather. The nearest Walmart is an hour away. I shop on line for this reason. One other reason is one of their pharmacy techs addressed me in front of a packed Walmart with threatening accusations. THIS particular store is going downhill. After this episode, I took a chance and placed an order on line to pick up due to the last interaction and Covid. After driving an hour to pickup my order, they had just a couple of the items in my order. Very disappointing to have wasted hours and not take home important necessities. I then ordered three items online on Sept 14th to have delivered to my home. Two items were cancelled without them contacting me. My last and final order was placed on September 19th, of course including the same unreceived items that were in my last request. After waiting for SO LONG, I receive an email on October 14th that said ALL ITEMS are delayed. I cancelled that order. I AM DONE. WALMARTS negative actions out weigh the good and being someone who has spent THOUSANDS of dollars in their store, they still insult and treat their customers like crap, like no bodies.

Walmart,"suggested wrong tire size, refused refund","I bought tires following walmart.com suggestion based on my car make and other specs. All walmart auto shops were closed for 4-5 months due to pandemic. So, I had to wait until they are reopen. When I brought tires to a shop, it turned out that the suggested tire size was wrong. I tried to apply for a refund/exchange by calling walmart.com customer service and initially got an approval for that with the instructions how to apply for a refund online and return tires in a local store. However, the walmart online service did not allow me to file return due to expiring 90 day policy. In store, they also refused to accept tires. I called walmart.com customer service 3 more times but they refused to accept wrong size tires. It looks like walmart does not respect their loyal customers, refusing to fix own faults, giving faulty recommendations to buy wrong goods. I was also surprised that all customer service representatives were not consistent of how the good can be returned giving faulty and confusing instructions. I had to waste $160, 5 hours of my time, 1 gallon of car gas, 40 min of my cellular call balance to understand that walmart would not fix its fault and let down.

Walmart,Who wins from so many Online ordered Damaged Goods?,"Actually I would rate a minus 0, but in order to write a review I had to give the lowest rating. I am absolutely frustrated with ordering online from Walmart and having FedEx deliver. And I would only be a fool, to ever do it again, especially for a larger appliance. I ordered an Avanti 7.4 ft.³ apartment size refrigerator, from Walmart online. Although it arrived in a timely matter within two weeks, it was crushed-in at the bottom next, to the motor and the tubing had paint flaking off. There are big signs on the back of the refrigerator, indicating not to use it if the tubing is damaged because the refrigerant is highly explosive and can be ignited with the spark from an outlet or even a cigarette. It was obvious the tubing could have been damaged, and therefore was too much of a risk to use it. I called Walmart to tell them I was going to return it and I had to strong-arm them because they kept trying to make a distinction between ordering from Walmart and ordering online from Walmart. I wasn’t taking any grief from them and demanded they give me a refund for a damaged product ordered online through Walmart. I took the refrigerator back they took it, and told me that they would refund me. I ordered another one online, like a fool, thinking that things would be different. And in another two weeks I get ANOTHER damaged refrigerator. Not the same damaged fridge, at least, but this time the motor inside the back of refrigerator, had one of its heavy metal brackets crushed, so now the motor was lopsided. The manual says if the refrigerator has vibration or noise it’s because the refrigerator motor is not level. And with this lopsided motor, I would never be able to make it level. Also the tubing coming out of the motor also had paint flaking off, indicating the tubing could have been compromised. Leaving me, the customer at risk of my refrigerator exploding in my house, if PG&E turned off the electricity and there was a spark igniting leaking refrigerant, that is highly flammable. I was ready to lambaste FedEx, but the reality was, there was no structural damage to the outside of the refrigerator, to indicate that this heavy metal motor bracket was damaged through transit. This looked like damage from the manufacture, so I I called Avanti and sent pictures in an email, of the damaged bracket They completely denied any responsibility, and said it was due to shipping. I had to contact Walmart to get a refund. Once again I had to return ANOTHER DAMAGED REFRIGERATOR to Walmart, and get a refund. It’s clear I have no guarantee whatsoever that ordering anything from Avanti, through Walmart online, and delivered by FedEx, will not be damaged again. It’s clear the customer, their time, and their effort, and the quality of the product you buy online, DOES NOT MATTER. This is the sad evolution, of products and service, and product accountability, in America, through Walmart online. The customer is the victim of damaged products without any responsibility- from the manufacturer like the “shady” Avanti, the online distributor like Walmart Online, and the deliverer like FedEx.I would like to see a conscientious lawyer do a ‘class action suit’ against Walmart Online, their shady manufacturers like Avanti, and Walmart’s FedEx deliveries. God knows, after reading all these reviews there is no lack of evidence, that the consumer is the victim. And customer service and product accountability IS DEAD. The other, really l sad consequence is it there is a lot of damaged goods and waste, from this agenda of ‘no accountability for products, or shipping’. Where do all these damaged goods go?? To the landfill?? Or are they resold again? In addition to the disregard for the customers time & effort, this chronic ‘damaged goods’ scenario, is a gross waste of the raw resources, used to make products, that are damaged on a ‘more than frequent’ basis. You have to ask yourself, “Who is really winning in this Damaged Goods syndrome?”",0,1
Walmart,I had been burned once by Walmart,"I had been burned by walmart.com once for a lousy $2.69. I ordered a package of "" Artificial Tears"" store pickup.Two minutes later they closed the picture and description of what I had just ordered It came back on later with no picture of the product only the description. The price was gone too. I called and they claimed they ran out of stock to wait until the next day. My sister was the designated pickup person. She had to go there for something else anyway so she took the online receipt and walked to the "" eye"" aisle. Sure enough,she found a dozen boxes on the shelf.So she picked up 2. One paid already online and the other one she would pay in person.The cashier charged her for 2!She said one was already paid for online. Cashier didn't care despite the receipt! She was told she had to go to the long line (as usual) to resolve the issue. She asked the cashier to forget it, she didn't want it. After all kinds of procedures and arguments, she got the entire order cancelled by the crabby cashier. Went to customer service and, surprisingly, the line only had 2 people so she waited her turn and put the already paid box in her purse and told to go to a cashier to pay for the one box. The paid one was already in her purse.The lines were so long she went back to customer service and threw the money on the counter and walked out.Security waves her by. Got in her car and left but I still wanted to complain about the treatment my sister went through. I called and was told we're out of stock"". I said it was in stock, "" my sister just picked 2 boxes off the shelf""Oh "" walk-in customers get first priority"". I had enough of their BS and hung up on her and it wasn't pretty. All over a $2.69 item! A few months later I needed 2 pairs of Wrangler Jeans 38x30 in stone blue. Not from a reseller but Walmart itself. Two days later they arrived in perfect condition, right color, right size, neatly folded. No ripped bag or damage at all.I lucked out that I took another risk with walmart.com. Don't buy from a third party reseller. Every item is clearly marked in blue with the resellers company name. No phone number or address either. But make sure you check who's selling it. If it says ""From Walmart"" that's where it will come from. A lot of resellers are scammers from Hong Kong, Vietnam, India.etc... they are knockoffs. In order to legally scam you the item is almost the same as the real ones but they are slightly off one way or another so they can't be charged with a counterfeit felony charge. And also, clothes or shoes cannot be returned. Wrong size? Too bad. I bought a Walmart reseller's 4 item charger for my phone, laptop, etc...it was way bigger than I wanted. I was looking for a pocket charger. I called to return them and get my card credited. ""What's the order number?"" They said it didn't match any order number they had and to call the reseller. They gave me the resellers phone number. They asked ""what's the order number?""""Walmart said you have it"" ""nope, call walmart"" ok. So I did, they blew me off and said the ""reseller is the company you need to contact"". I truly wanted to return it as it was a $40.00 item! They bounced me back and forth. Nobody had it.I had enough of this game and filed a dispute with my CC company. They put the money back into my account ""temporarily"" until the matter was resolved. They had 90 days to respond or my temporary hold is returned back to "" permanent"".90 days go by and neither ever responded to my CC dispute. I won and the money released on my card.A month or so later, the reseller emails me. And this time they had the order. number listed. I wrote back ""You had your chance and never responded to my CC letter!"" ""Too late, I'm keeping it"". They never responded to my CC company and I called them several times for an order number and they never responded to me either. I am now the proud owner of a $40.00, 4 device charger. Free! I never heard from them again. In fact, they just emailed me a brochure for the exact same thing! I laughed!So ordering online from walmart.com is a 50% risk. Read the fine print because they sure as heck know it. Do not buy from a reseller. You'll probably never get a refund. Calling corporate does nothing. Mr. Walter owns the largest retail store in the world and his aids read their mail and crumbles it to the wastepaper basket.By the way, customer service does not care and the minimum wage earners working there don't seem like they want to be there. Customers can be just as bad. They want everything now and some are basically stupid. I love my in-store Walmart. I'm nice to them and they will even take me to the item I'm looking for. Practically holding my hand! And the store is super clean with no merchandise on the floor that had fallen off the shelf or pulled down by customers. Most of the time there are enough cashier's and a short wait to cash out. They are quick and pleasant.",0,5

I received an email saying that my item was out for shipment and should be on my doorstep by April... It never arrived. I found out by actively tracking my order that my item was re-routed and was never shipped back to me ever again. No email from Walmart or from the third-party seller to notify me of this. Sent in several inquiries for my order or a refund with no response from Walmart or the third-party seller. I finally was allowed to connect with an online chat agent in October (7 months later after the initial order and several requests to either reship me my order or provide me a refund), and I was informed that Walmart simply can't do anything about it because I quote ""it was an market place product your refund will be transfered from the vendor that's why it's taking a bit long because seller is not that quick response."" ""But the seller is not responding that's the reason you are waiting for so long."" (verbatim what the agent told me). I was also accused by the agent for not contacting the seller, even though I have the email records to prove otherwise, and I was yelled at in caps lock by the agent. I have never received such terrible and unprofessional customer service anywhere else.Walmart is a LARGE company and yet they can't provide something as simple as a guarantee and protection for its customers. From such a large company, you would assume that they have vetted their third-party sellers and made sure they are reputable, or at the very least willing to provide their customers with refunds when their own third-party seller disappears off the face of this planet.

Walmart,Walmart & Fed Ex are a match made in Hell.,"Walmart Online and Fed Ex are a match made in hell. Anytime I order from Walmart, something goes horribly wrong. Wrong items, missing items, items that grow mold because Fed Ex refuses to deliver them until the box has been destroyed and the items inside are damaged. Next Day Delivery is a joke, at least in my area. Fed Ex refuses to deliver, claims they can't access the area. They never even drive by. Walmart offers hollow apologies and the promise it will arrive tomorrow. It doesn't. This goes on for several days before a package is deemed lost or damaged and returned to Walmart. What does Walmart do for me? Nothing. More hollow apologies and customer service reps that ask you the same things 3-4 times. Walmart also has the tendency to cram everything you order in 1 box, regardless of how bulky or weighty some items may be. Their packaging department lacks any shred of common sense. Drunk monkeys with missing arms would package items better than the imbeciles at Walmart. I have told them several times, you can't cram all that in one box no matter how big the box is. Walmart always apologizes and says they'll forward the feedback to the appropriate department. That feedback must have been sent via FedEx because nothing has changed in the several months I've been telling them this.A big, heavy, monster of a box means Fed Ex won't want to lift the box, and instead drives around with it for days on end, manhandles it, and takes it back to Walmart. How are either of these companies getting away with this? How is Walmart not losing millions a year with such irresponsible practices? How is FedEx still in business? It doesn't matter how good the prices are when they use a carrier that won't deliver. It doesn't matter what you order with free shipping because unless it's a single item, they will package it so it gets destroyed. And if it's a single item in a small box or envelope, the wrong FedEx driver will seemingly forget about it for days on end. There is no winning with these two. What good is free shipping when they'd rather pack the items in a damaging way than use another box or two? Using one box will NOT speed up your shipping if you live in a place where FedEx lies and refuses to deliver. Walmart Online has been a frustrating failure in 90% of my experiences, many of which were before Covid, so don't use that to defend them. The fact they think they can compete with Amazon Prime with their new ""Walmart Plus"" service is a joke. Unless the ""Plus"" is they'll use more than 1 box to ship your stuff and they'll use UPS (even USPS is better) than I predict it will be no less frustrating than the standard Walmart online shopping experience. I love saving money, but I'd rather pay more at Target or Amazon and actually recieve my items in a fair time frame than go through the frustration of ordering online at Walmart ever again. What good is saving money on things they can't actually deliver? They've lost loyal family of customers this year.",0,1

Walmart,AWFUL SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE,"AWFUL SERVICE AND EXPERIENCEI picked up a fridge purchased online at the Penguin Warehouse Pick-up location at 629 Eastern Avenue, Toronto, ON. When I brought it home in my SUV and opened the box, I was shocked to find it very badly damaged. Imagine my shock given this was the first time I had ever purchased anything online from Walmart. In addition to being damaged, the online delivery timer was consistently incorrect and gave extremely misleading information (as late as the afternoon after I picked it up, hours after I already had the item in hand, it was still shown to be in-processing at some warehouse and not yet even READY for pick-up). A customer service representative from Walmart that I spoke to earlier that day informed me that the item was indeed NOT ready for pick-up, that they would be communicating with Penguin by email, and that the item would only be ready several days from then (while it was ALREADY sitting there waiting to be picked up). Sceptical, I called Penguin to verify and, lo and behold, they informed me that the item had been delivered DAYS prior and was waiting for me since the original delivery date of Saturday, August 1, in spite of what was posted online and told to me DIRECTLY by Walmart personnel.Now, not only had I been repeatedly misled by the Walmart staff, website, and online tracking services, but I was stuck with an unacceptably damaged item. Walmart SAID they would be dispatching Canada Post to pick up the damaged item, and I was told to send them an email confirming my contact & address details.FOR OVER A WEEK NOTHING HAPPENS - NO PICK-UP, NO CALLBACK, NOTHING!I called four times on the the 1-800 number they provided (1-800-328-0402), and after being on hold for a very very long time each time, I finally got through to a clerk. By this time, I was understandably frustrated. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was informed the only ones available were monolingual Quebecois located in Quebec, and that I would be REQUIRED to speak French if I were to get through to them. This is absolutely ludicrous, unacceptable, and borderline unconstitutional. Since when did Walmart become a french or anglo-exclusionary company? How is this at all legal? So far as I know, this it is not - you cannot force me to speak French to a supervisor when receiving service in Toronto (much the same that a Francophone cannot be denied service in French if requested, and be forced to speak English). I was told to send the initial email and that Walmart would respond within a ""couple of days"". They did not. I emailed again (after over a week), still nothing.After being told it would be picked up from my house, but never receiving a phone call or email or any kind of correspondence confirming or scheduling this, the damaged fridge was still sitting in my living room weeks after I was told it would be picked up. Doubting this would happen at all - I took matters into my own hands. Keep in mind, every correspondence of mine to Walmart was met with a boilerplate auto-response lie that they would respond ""within 3-4 business days"". Until THIS WEEK, they never responded back with either a phone-call or email.After jumping through all that rigamarole and BS, I had to go, by myself, lifting this fridge, and bringing it directly to Canada Post so that they could pack it up and send it back. To add insult to injury, Walmart not only ignored my communication with them, but despite acknowledging my claim and offering a refund, none was ever received. It took me contacting my credit card company to dispute the matter so that the charges associated with the fridge would be voided and a refund finally given to me. This was over TWO MONTHS after Walmart told me they would refund the charges, sending an email confirming this, but never doing so or communicating back at all. All this for a product that arrived in an unacceptably damaged condition.The only correspondence I ever got back from Walmart after August 13th, despite repeated attempts at contacting them for either clarification on the pick-up or refund, was THIS PAST WEEK on September 24th, when they acknowledged the complaint from my CREDIT CARD COMPANY (acknowledging NONE of their failures in communication or customer service as outlined above)Needless to say, I will not be shopping with Walmart, either in person or online, ever again.

She didn't use a pager or anything but just looking around then finally she called a lady supervisor who was passing by who told me the same thing then I told her It's 24 something then she said to come with her to check the price which I did, bringing my daughter with me to the fridge again. The cashier told the CS manager to suspend the transaction so she can take customers then when we were at the fridge I told her I got it there where the 24 something price.

She took a picture of it and check the price/confirmed it but instead of her telling the cashier herself, she got a call from the radio, told me to go back and tell the pricemyself.... Of course that is not the end of the inconvenience, the cashier can't ring it up.. She needs the ""freaking"" barcode. I told her I don't know why she has to tell me to tell the cashier and yet she can't help me...Then they called another Indian/Fijian supervisor and instead of resolving the issue, she was lecturing me about their protocol that they cannot sell the cans of beer because it's not in their system but yet they had it on the floor for sale not just one but so many of them. What kind of store who will place the items and not check their products to make sure they are in their system for sale. The managers excuse she doesn't work there, she can have it remove from the fridge but not sell the products and they can get in trouble for selling and not in their system where in fact the other supervisor had the barcode and took a picture/confirmed the price but fail to tell her cashier, had to do it myself!!! Then that lady who took the barcode came back too late to show the other supervisor but still that supervisor doesn't want me to have it because I was already giving them attitude...WHO WOULDN'T COMING BACK AND FORTH AND STILL UNRESOLVED. I tried to leave the store but then again I want to complain about the quality of service how the issue was handled and still I was not able to get the cans of beer. They called another manager who didn't do anything instead of resolving my issue. She asked her manager instead of me? Don't you think she should talk to the customer instead of her co-employees??? This filipino manager didn't even ring up the item, not even resolved the issue as well.. Said the samething even though they already have the barcode!!!I Didn't even try to resolve a customer's issue... It was a waste of time to call another superior because she was not helpful either. Honestly, I don't drink beer and I'm just getting this formy husband and since I need supplies for my older daughter that I had to get it at the same time thinking that I will be able to get these items without traveling from store to store due to Covid19. The motto ""live better Walmart"" yes because of the price is cheaper than others but the quality of service is poor...and being a long time customer at this store... I am very disappointed and will never ever go back.....",0,1

Walmart,Worst service ever,"I'm writing this review to keep my promise to the customer service supervisor that I was going to share the absolute worst service ever from an online retailer. To start the items ordered were an outdoor patio set, 4 chairs with cushions,and a large patio table, the chairs arrived in a reasonable time frame but I was waiting for the table to arrive to begin assembly,the chairs are about 250 parts n pieces 2 weeks went by as I assembled about 2.5 chairs,.. still no table after an hour on the phone I find out they are no longer able to finish delivery of the table because they don't have it! So they tell me they will send a truck for pickup,..2 weeks pass and no pick up. Then a week after they try to charge me.. again for a table not received,.. another operator on the phone for an hour to explain.. again this time they assured me again someone will pickup,.. another 2 weeks passes no pickup, this time the following week I received a letter saying they have turned me in to a collection agency, I immediately called again another hour on the phone to explain the problem for the third time to a person, only this time I get an 8 hour window for the scheduled pickup where someone is supposed to be at the residence,..they didn't show up!! Now I'm extremely pissed! Another hour on the phone to explain for the fourth time this time an extra half hour on the phone to explain to a second person,( a supervisor) that this problem isn't getting solved in any way by talking to anyone and all of a sudden a new pickup date is arranged but no one has to be here this time for pickup, absolutely ridiculous customer service the worst ever!! This order was placed back in late May chairs have been in my garage taking up space for so long that mice chewed half the cushions, it's now September and still haven't been picked up, supposed to be Monday we'll see if they make good on the pickup but I ain't holding my breath.. never again from me an online Wal Mart order hands down worst service ever 👎👎. .. UPDATE 10/3/20After another hour on the phone with a customer service supervisor, they've finally agreed to drop all charges,and I will be keeping the chairs,.( They've made good on the refund and stopped collections) ... finally",0,1

Walmart,Shady advertising and worse customer service,"I order an IPad from Walmart.com on 9/23/20 because they said it would arrive on 9/25/20. I only did this because of the promised arrival date. I could have driven to Best Buy and had it sooner, but Walmart said it would be here and it was earlier than the date I needed to have it by so I did it. My order went into ""preparing order, Tracking number available soon"" within an hour. When the status hadn't updated by the midday on the 24th I contacted customer service for the first time. I was told that he couldn't tell me anything and my order status should update within 24 hours. I waited until bedtime and again contacted customer service. This time I was told that there was no status update yet and no future guidance yet, my best bet was to wait and see. The morning of the 25th came and no update so again I contacted customer service. I was told that my order hadn't shipped yet and because of high demand they were delaying shipping them. What? I checked the website and they were still offering next day delivery if I ordered within the next hour! I decided to wait and see if it would update and at least be delivered soon as I needed it asap at this point. Three hours later I got an email saying that the IPad was backordered an my order would be updated or canceled when they knew something. I checked and they were still offering delivery next though. I still decided to wait and see. Later that day I decided to cancel and drive and pick one up. I canceled my order online only to be told that it would take 48 hours to process my cancelation even though they missed the delivery date and didn't have what they advertised as having in stock. It took three more attempts and an getting transfered to a manager to get a cancelation processed the same day. I can't begin to tell you how maddening this all was after dealing with great customer service and on time deliveries from competitors for years. I will never deal with Walmart again. I totally understand high demand and supply, but don't falsely advertise you can deliver something that you can't and then treat your customers like garbage when you do it.",0,1

I cringe every time I have to go in that store which is less and less. I'd rather go some place else and pay extra to avoid that place. They definitely do not have their act together. The managers stand around talking instead of shortening the time you have to wait in line. During this pandemic, we want to get out of the store as quickly as possible and that never happens. The store is filthy, the restrooms are disgusting. Even the smell when you walk into the store makes you want to throw up. The managers in that store need to go managerial school because the way they manage a store is pathetic. It took them years to replace the light over the greeting card section, where you need a light and they couldn't even do that right. Many customers are agree Get your act together!",0,1

Walmart,Walmart (SuperStore),"Walmart (SuperStore) - Rinehart Road, Sanford, FL To help improve service I wanted to give you feedback on my recent pickup experience for this order detailed below. Fast it was not, convenient I am also afraid not, and to top it off despite waiting over 30mins when the order was presented it was wrong. To give some further details, when I arrived, I called the number I was requested to do. It took the Walmart associated (Alyssa) almost 20mins to respond and when she did it was the wrong order. She was not apologetic in any form for either her tardy responsiveness or the fact that the order was wrong. So, fast it was not. The associate went back inside without any communication of the purpose and did not return. I called the number a second time in order to receive the goods I ordered and paid of. The associated eventually return but this time only provided me with 1 item of the 4 I ordered. So in reality I only received 25% or the order and requesting formally a refund for the other 75% or for the order to be fulfilled as originally requested. Convenient, not even close, hassle would be closer to the actual experience. For your information one of their direct competitors, Target, I have done curbside picked numerous times in the last 6 months. They make curbside pick-up extremely convenient, the staff are pleasant, highly responsive, and arrive at the car almost as soon as you get there (highly organized and efficient). Orders are completed in full almost 100% of the time and when they can’t, for whatever reason, they are prompt with their action, communication, and refund to remediate.

Walmart,Pick Up Service A Big Miss,I typically order from Walmart and have it delivered to my house. The prices are better in many cases compared to Amazon and faster delivery. The challenge began this week when I accidentally selected pick up at the store versus having the products delivered to my house. I decided that I would just go pick up the items and get a few other things while I was at the store. The cashier did not know where to pick up the items and when I went to the tower for pick up of material there were people already waiting and indicated they been waiting there for more than 15 minutes. I was able to locate a store manager after talking to a number of employees that did not seem to know how to operate the kiosk or were able to facilitate with order pick ups. After another 15 minutes we were able to get some help by an employee who started to distribute material to those waiting for pick up. The couple that have been there on my arrival received a curtain rod that was bent and was told just to go pick another one out of the store and the second customer was told that the Ramen noodles on or whatever weren’t there because they were stocked out; I explained I had just seen an entire aisle of the same product. Clearly There is a disconnect between the online delivery to house versus pick up services. The stores are not equipped to support the pick up model. Walmart needs to either drop this service or amp it up to people and or exceed the director home shipping experience.,0,1

Walmart,triple bad and ignorant service,"I was at walmart earlier and received some ver bad service there was a woman in front of me and we all were doing the social distance mess. There wa stwo women in front of the woman in front of me. As the second woman was paying for her stuff the employee let the woman in front of me start putting here items on the belt. Ok once her items which were few had moved up to where the clerk was and there was still 6 to 7 feet between us, I started putting my few items on the counter, oh the clerk informed me quick to stay back and not put my items on the counter yet. The woman in front of me was paying for her stuff while the clerk bagged the items, so I stepped to the counter again still 6 ft way and mroe, and the damn clerk told me again to step back, by this time the woman in front of me had paid for her stuff and got the bags and she was on the other end of the aisle where the round table is, I then stepped for ward a third time and the clerk told me again to step back. This was ignorant insanity to the limit. I turned around and went to the self check out area and was in and gone in under 5 minutes. I will never try to support the the few employees again by going to the manned isles and will instead use from here on out the self checkout line.",0,1
Walmart,I have had very good experiences…,"I have had very good experiences shopping with WalMart online. Occasionally I have items sent directly to friends and family as gifts. Sometimes I have items delivered to my home. Most often, I place an order online and pick it up at our local WalMart store. I have learned to carefully read the details about who is selling the item on WalMart.com. Many times it is a third party seller and an item is not eligible for return or exchange through WalMart. I have found several excellent bargains online (over WalMart's regular in-store low prices.)",0,5

Walmart,"Follow your own rules, ok?!","For the most part, I like Walmart. I like that you can go and get just about anything from hardware to underwear and then do your grocery shopping in one trip. I am an at risk senior so I also like that they've set aside an hour in the morning one day a week for me to shop with less customers in the store. That said, I wish they would follow their own rules. They have arrows marking the directions you should go up and down the aisle to eliminate cross traffic. But I see the Walmart shoppers misusing this all the time. Also, masks are required, but I see Walmart employees either not wearing them or wearing them incorrectly. Last Tuesday one was wearing a silk super thin one layer scarf/kerchief thing and it was just draped up over her face sort of but the sides were open. Like why bother? Not a mask in any way, shape or form. And even at that, she would pull it down to talk to another employee not standing even close to 6 feet apart. I have also seen outside vendors abusing the mask policy, too. And lastly, seems like the senior shopping hour is getting a bit lax, too. The outside single line barriers are all but down. I see people who are either not seniors, or who have very good plastic surgeons or botox or something. And it's not just me or just my store. My daughter-in-law shops at a different Walmart on the other side of town and she's noticed the same abuse of policy. It's one thing to see customers not following the rules, but when it's your own employees, the effort to tout yourselves as an organization who cares and wants to keep everyone safe turns into just more of the same hype.",0,2

Walmart,Walmart Doesn’t Care,"Multiple signs out front including a huge one clearly state that masks are required. They even have someone stationed inside the door for the ostensible purpose of enforcing the rule. When I complained about the 1/3 of customers and roughly 20% of employees not following the rule, I was told by the guard that she had been instructed to not enforce the company’s rule. When I told her to take the signage down, she told me that decision rested elsewhere. In other words, the store manager is too ignorant or too lazy to look at any of the dozens of cameras in their store to see what is happening or they have the authority to overrule company policy with impunity. Walmart does not care if customers and employees that are too stupid or belligerent to understand that masks are not for their benefit but they are intended for the life safety of those they encounter in the store. Walmart - enforce your policies or take the signs down. Based on this experience, I do not feel safe in this store and would advise anyone with any concern about COVID to stay out of this place.",0,1

We went to check out and they would not honor the sale price off of their own app. Sale guy kept making excuses after excuses. Even used their own store scanner, his own Walmart app off of his phone (which still come up with the same sale price off of the barcode) but Walmart REFUSES to honor it! Spoke to his so call manager three time. After wasting about 20 minutes of our time to to come up with lame excuses as to why they can’t honor it. At last, he said he would call the same manager that spoke to 3 time, when she came up to him, he had to take anther 5 minutes to explain it to her again. She came to making excuses that it’s sales price is thru online only on Walmart app, another excuses is the barcode is not correct off of their own Walmart app. If so, what the use of the scan in your app?? For a manager to try to make lame excuses like that when you are working for the store is Sad. Poor customer service and they lie about their low prices!

Walmart,Bad walmart.com....bad,"I placed an order that was supposed to be a 2 day delivery. I didn't receive my order. I noticed the order was still sitting in Carrollton, Ga and had not budged even on the delivery day. I wasn't contacted by walmart and gave them a couple extra days for this 2 day delivery. When I finally initiated contact, I kept getting told our system is messing up. I couldn't help but wonder why it didn't mess up on taking my money but messed up on shipping my item. Well fast forward 1 week, I have talked to several people and chatted with several as well. I get the point how sorry they are about this order went and how their system won't allow them to do anything except escalate the complaint. I get the point of how they will refund my money and I'll have it in another week, all while I ordered this tent to go to the mountains with my family next week. The tent was supposed to have been here by 9/6 and today is the 11th and by it being a 2 day delivery that I needed on the 14th, something is terribly amiss here. Customer service even went so far as to tell me they couldn't GIVE me a $179 tent. I didn't ask them to give me anything, I paid for it and the least that could have happened was they accidentally ship it. But to have the audacity to tell me they couldn't GIVE me the thing, well let's say that took some nerve (balls really). I only asked that the item be replaced since they did tell me they lost it. Again, that was too hard. Some genius took it upon themselves and wanted to cancel the order (no I wasn't told) and supposedly refund my money. One person said the refund is complete and one said it's still processing so they couldn't do anything since their system was messed up. I asked since the refund was processing, could they not stop it and replace the item. I was told no, their system was messed up and there was nothing they could do. So here I sit with no tent, no money from them to reorder the tent and now their website says they are low in stock. I am not a happy camper here. They told me their system was updated recently and so not sure why they had to fix what wasn't broken. I have ordered quite a few items from them in the past and received them with no problem prior to the update but now the only items I can get from walmart.com, are the ones that come from third party sellers. Lesson learned, don't fix what isn't broken since each person I have talked to (about 8) have all blamed the updated system as the reason they can't do anything to help me.

I called customer service on August 28th and was told I would receive a response by email within 48 hours. Today is September 6th. I was not contacted and had to call customer service again. At this time I was notified that I had received a credit for this item. It has yet to appear on my account. I am very frustrated with walmart's customer service experience. Why procure items from 3rd party vendors when they don't arrive and when you expect individuals to be contacting vendors on their own? On August 28th the associate was even resistant to contact the seller on my behalf. The ""customer service"" team was adamant about having me do all the work on my own. Terrible service.",0,1

I called their customer service which was very difficult to deal with and I have to call them back to find out what happened because third-party sellers are selling through walmart.com and are not living up to what they advertised as what descriptions of the items they are selling. Walmart.com is not living up to its standards of being reliable with its third-party sellers. I recommend not using it and go through Amazon.com instead,0,1

Walmart,No Refund for Undelivered/late Purchased Online Items,"This review is in regards to to latest Walmart online Order #5092005-442589 placed through Walmart.com on August 25, 2020. The order was for the purchase of a TCL 50"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV 4 Series 50S425, for a total cost of $269.99 as advertised on the Walmart.com website. Although the order for this item, originally showed that it was shipped out to me via FedEx, for delivery to me on 8/28/ 2020, subsequently I found out it was never actually shipped out by Walmart.com. Since the Walmart merchandise was never shipped to me, I have requested on 4-four separate occasions that Walmart.com immediately refund the $298.26 (includes tax & fees) to me that they took out of my bank account for this item on 8/26/2020. Refunding my money for the undelivered item is my primary purpose for this complaint. In addition, my secondary purpose for this complaint is to make Walmart management aware of an apparent worsening problem encountered by me and my family with ordering and the lack of timely delivery of items purchased through Walmart.com. We first noticed this ordering and the lack of timely delivery in December 2019, which has got worse with every item we have purchased via Walmart.com throughout 2020, The final straw for us was in regards to our last order placed through Walmart.com on August 25, 2020 (Order #5092005-442589). Since around August 26th, when you click on the link given for the FedEx tracking shown on Walmart.com for this order it shows that the item was shipped from Chino, CA for delivery to me on August 28th, However, when August 28th, came the item was not actually delivered. I contacted Walmart via online chat and I was told the shipment was delayed and the item would actually arrive on August 29th. I waited until after 9 pm on the 29th and the item did not arrive so I contacted Walmart.com online and asked them to call me on the telephone. When Walmart called me, I explained the latest problem with the timely delivery of the item purchased through Walmart.com. the customer service rep I was talking to said the item was never shipped and would possibly arrive on Monday or Tuesday of the following week, but they were not sure. When I heard this uncertainty regarding the item that I had purchased, I asked the customer service to cancel the order and refund my money. The Walmart.com customer service rep that I was speaking told me that they would immediately cancel the order for the undelivered item and that I would be receiving email confirmation of this cancelation via email within 30 minutes. During the period August 29-September 1st I made my request for the cancellation of Order #5092005-442589 and the refund of my money in four separate communications with Walmart.com, each of these communications has resulted in the Walmart.com customer service rep promising to send email confirmation of this cancelation. As well as the initiation of the Walmart.com refund process, via email within 30 minutes. To this date “no order cancelation” or refund process initiation, has never actually happened as promised by Walmart.com, “NO email confirmation has ever been sent by Walmart.com to me via email either. In addition, please investigate and fix the problems with Walmart.com. Until Walmart fixes the issues that I pointed out, it will be impossible for me and my family to continue buying stuff from Walmart.com",0,1

Walmart,3 strikes....WALMART - YOU'RE OUT!!!,"Walmart took away the savings catcher which even the local store employees I know are very unhappy about. Maybe the CEO found out that he wasn't scraping in every possible penny from the customer and put a stop to that real quick...I know I could be completely wrong, but someone's GREED usually plays a role in these types of decisions, especially when it has to do with a huge, very successful company like WM. The other issue is they took away the ability to view and print out a normal looking receipt when you place an online order for curbside pickup. They used to have those in their app...why in the world would you take such a feature AWAY when it's already there?? So now I have a rebate for 2 items I purchased, but the company who's offering the rebate wants a normal looking receipt. Walmart just told me they were sorry but that ""went away with the changes"". Finally, they also don't accept coupons with their online orders either. 3 strikes....WALMART - YOU'RE OUT!!!",0,1

When I initially received the item, it arrived in a box which was not packaged properly (seemed like someone had opened the monitor already and returned it) and the item was TOTALLY INCORRECT! They sent me a different model which was less than half the cost of the one my gift giver purchased (the one on the actual registry). I had to call the gift giver who had to contact walmart and sort the issue which was super inconvenient. After processing a refund and a new order, I waited 3 weeks only to receive an email stating the order has been CANCELLED with NO explanation given. I had to call customer service again, wait 30 mins on hold only to find out that they are out of stock of the actual model we ordered! And the site STILL SAYS IN STOCK! I am so frustrated.

Consumers don't realize that their package is not coming directly from Walmart, IT LITERALLY GOES THROUGH SEVERAL SHIPPING PROCESSES, in warehouses, on trucks, etc. So a lot can happen between Walmart shipping out your items and once it reaches your residence.Walmart has ALWAYS helped replace the item or refund my money and sometimes even let me keep the item that was damaged so that I don't have to bother with returning it to the store. They also give the option of returning it to the store in person or through mail, they'll send you a shipping label.Walmart grocery is the best I've ever used! For items that are out of stock, my substitutions are almost always something I'd choose, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes (always less than) at pick up to get my groceries, the employees are always nice and knowledgeable, and my groceries are usually ready before my scheduled time slot!I recommend Walmart website to all my friends and family because I have had many more positive experiences than negative!

It will say transit and that it is in your city, but then for me it got delayed TWICE after it said it was in transit in my city. If I could give a negative star, I would. Walmart provides essentially no feedback as to time of arrival, as they seem to just delay as they please, without any explanation why. This delaying process should not be able to occur FOUR times.

Walmart customer service was always friendly and reassuring when I spent hours on the phone with them, but essentially they did nothing. I am still on the phone trying to recover the restocking fee.

Every time I tried to get clarification, she would interrupt me and would not let me speak, talking down to me like I was a child or something.

Walmart,Ripped off by Walmart,Seven months ago I bought a small refrigerator. A week and a half after it was supposed to be delayed I called. They told me that they canceled the order and reordered with a 30% discount. When that one was delivered it was all dented and I returned it. They credited me for the discount price and I bought one somewhere else. 2 months ago the charge was on my card again. I called and was told that they hadn't charged me. I contacted the credit card company and they held the money until investigated. Then released it back to my account. Now they billed me for it again and when I called told me the first one ordered was delivered and I would have to pay or contract the credit card company to dispute it. The credit card company has told me that Walmart has to remove the charge. So now I have to give $243.47 to Walmart in order to keep a bad mark against my credit off of my record. DO NOT TRUST WALMART.,0,1
Walmart,What can I say about the late great…,"What can I say about the late great WalMart? Well, I guess first off I would like to give a shout out to Sam, the founder..Sam, although we all know by now ...that you have probably spent the most part of your passing, rolling in your grave...I just want you to know we DO NOT Blame you in any way shape or form for the abuses it's overseas manufacturing plant workers in China, who are forced to live on $3.00/day and forced to work 7 days a week under human rights violations. Nor, Sam can we disparage you for the fact of the low wages, understaffed, forced to go on welfare employees in the U.S.Nor would anyone accuse you of environmental violations here in the U.S. and far more likely as well around the world. And of course could we Blame you for all the female discrimination that is more than very likely still going on, especially probably still here in the states, and..., And, well...The list so far is only the tip of Mount Everest, so I'm sorry Sam, but there's a recent visit to one of the WalMart stores built years later after our mourning of your passing. And it went a little bit like this... Before I could step on the front outside walkway, I instantly became a wanted suspected criminal as suddenly I was facing a barrage of embarrassing barking orders that I could not enter that particular store w/o a mask even as I had my mask in my hand covering my face as I attempted to secure the mask stringage around both ears. So, Still not sure why I was betrayed for some kind of crime I guess this particular store employee thought she saw before her to bark, I MEAN BARK AT ME AS IF ""I WAS A DOG!?"" SO... Anyway , I walk into the store and I see another employee ring highly rude to an elderly lady at the self checkouts and I try to ignore this, for fear at being now either barked at or treated in a similar rude manner as the poor old lady was regretfully being talked down to .Anyway ..I realize right away I really have already seen enough to shorten my shopping list. Considerably from 17 items to just one item. So I go to get that one item and... Drumroll, that item is not on the shelf, so I needed to reassure myself that I did not waste time by driving a few miles to get at the store in the first place by choosing the next just as important item off the shelf... Only to find no shelf. The shelf was missing along with the item., Soooooo, I decided on the next important item to find it was the very last item ...and still sitting on the shelf even though clearly it was broken with broken pieces of glass surrounding it.3X would not be the charm over the fruitless effort I initiated to shop, buy, and bring home with me. So, upon hearing and then witnessing a sudden scuffle between an employee and a customer, with the employee trying his damnest to bring this customer down WWE, THATS when I high-tailed it outta that department nearly running for the exit doors!!! WalMart is as I quickly summized, some twisted parody paradox of it's former self....(what WalMart once was when Sam was alive). From A company that really had a solid grasp of reality when it came to treating not only their employees with respect and dignity, Sam's Way... To some kind of loathing experience shared by customers and employees alike!!!! I mean, come on WalMart!!! What ever happened to you after Sam's passing, huh? Why the ongoing abuse and immoral judgements and unfounded actions you now cling tightly to!?!?!? Where and why did all this have to come about, other than the clear fact it's being run into the ground by some would relate to greedy psychotic behaviors that show case what happens when a once great company comes under seige by bottom lines not to it's employees or customers benefit, but clearly instead to the rich shareholders and the ilk that for now dominate over the corporate offices. Seriously WalMart, what will the future bring you, what will history end up saying about you? Do you want to be on the right side of history? Stay on the same last two decades track of lies and deceit? Seriously?",0,1

Walmart’s answer was, “sorry they must’ve gotten lost.” So I said, “ok, now what?” They said, “Well, we can refund you, but we cant replace them because we no longer have them.” After 3 months of waiting, this is the only thing Walmart can say.

For clothes like tee shirts and Pjs the material is awful and the size is not really what it says. Usually runs small. On the website it will tell you that you can return All on line purchases to the store if needed but then when you bring it back to the store you have to end up packing it up with a label and ship it back to wherever it came from, which isn’t Walmart! I like to buy products From stores that offer a return to the actual store and not have to ship it back. Maybe Walmart finds these products to be a convenience for customers to have a more diverse shopping experience, but if i wanted products from another store or place, i would have done so. Walmart is of course, a place to shop for things that are less expensive but its true - you get what you pay for.

And they actually keep track of who buys it!!! What gives them the right to dictate what meds people can and can't have??? Prescribed or otherwise?? There's 30 days to a month!!! What do they expect you to do? Suffer the other 15 days??? You can go to Walgreens or CVS and buy 2 boxes at once to last the month and I'll suggests to anyone that you do just that!!!,0,1
Walmart,Walmart in New Richmond WI on…,"I was at Walmart in New Richmond WI on August 21, 2020. I have had way too many wrong rings in the past that I now scan everything on there app before I put it in my cart. I had a cart load of items and found a blemish kit for $1.82. I scan and it rings up $7.97. I look at the upc and it matches. Mind you, the UPC strip is above the tags, which are above the item. The UPC strip is one that goes across the shelf so items are put in the correct spot. The corresponding tags are then put directly below, but above the product. I finish my shopping and go to the checkout. When the cashier rings up the item for the higher price I inform her that the tag stated $1.82. I show her the picture I took of the item and she agreed it should be $1.82. She then couldn't find her override key so she called a CSM over. CSM is a Customer Service Manager. CSM Kristen then came over, did a price check and removed all the product in that spot. She told me the price was $7.97 and the product was in the wrong spot. I told her the product is not in the wrong spot because of the UPC strip. (The UPC strip is about 4 feet long, meaning the item is in the correct spot) CSM Kristen then said that the tag was in the wrong spot and that someone must have moved it. I then told her it wasn't me and I want it for the listed price of $1.82. Also if she didn't believe me to pull the tapes of me in the isle. CMS Kristen said she wasn't doing that and the price was $7.97. I then asked her if she wanted to lose a sale of approximately $200 over $5. CSM Kristen said to do whatever I wanted. So I left.

Walmart,The City With No God,"The usual scent greets me as I pass through the security pylons. I pass hordes of faceless people and tired associates shuffling into the morning shift. The endless beams of bright fluorescent lighting and uncountable price tags stretches on and on, as if the end was not meant to be discovered. The high ceiling is low enough to remove any sense of beauty or meaning or awe, but high enough to make you feel worthless. It seems to scream, ""There is no sky, there is no other universe, there is no God."" The air conditioning makes it cool, maybe even chilly, but just hot enough to be uncomfortably warm at a brisk shoppers pace.I hear 'Don't You Want Me Baby' playing on the com. It has played everyday for the past 40 years. Or is it 50? I can't remember how long I've been here. The shelves are empty of everything I need. I would ask an employee if they have more in the back, but they won't know anyway. After all, they've only been here for about two weeks, and no one really bothered to train them properly. Heck, out of the ten store managers I've seen around, only one is normally at the store. The customers, lit up only by interaction with another, as if just to please an arbitrary social cue, and scrambling desperately to get the best stuff, the most stuff, for the lowest price, erupt in wild frenzy, ripping apart shelves until they are satisfied or the banquet is over.I stumble through the disorienting rollbacks, clearance, and endcaps; so many voices speaking to me but not one answer. The prices aren't really exceptional, neither is the selection. It seems like they never get anything new. The store lines are crammed with pallets of new stock and cardboard at this time of evening. After a long trip to the top of one pallet, I have a better view of the sales floor: A writhing labyrinth of both utility and greed, life and death, push and pull. These humans that were once people, devouring the wares with green paper, and robotic associates wiring themselves to the registers, pumping it into their bodies, depleting their very substance of life, time, in hopes of joining the feast that their kings are consuming, heads bowed down to the customer as they count cash, scan storage, and stock shelves; they are only gears in a massive machine that indeed to some elongate and to others reinforce the human bonds between producer and consumer.Impassionate faces float past me, as clouds in the sky vanishing to an unknown horizon, as night sets in. I try to speak to one, but he passes right through me, as if I don't exist. I try again, but to no avail. I pail in astronomical brightness to the boxes on the shelves. After all, they're not here for me. Once again, they pass through, joining the impenetrable sea of mystery that is the collective consumer. Depressed, I sneak into the backroom, settle down into the baler, and start the press. There is no good, no evil.Goodbye cruel world.In summary: meh",0,3

After a few days we decided that the t.v was no longer needed. 8 days later I went back to Walmart on Conley Road to return the t.v. Upon arriving to return the t,v. I was informed by an Anna that they had no record of the purchase. I did not have the receipt at the time. It had been submitted to our business office. Another guy who appeared to be over Anna tried to go into the back office to try and find the receipt. They both asked me the date of purchase, which I did not know at the time. He looked up a couple of dates in the back supposebly and came back and said we cannot find the receipt based on your credit card numbers. I stood holding the credit card and he said all I need is the last four numbers of the card. They did not use my card otherwise to track the t.v. I was then informed that I would have to go back to my company and get the receipt because they could not verify the purchase otherwise. While standing at the front counter another employee walked up to ask a question who got in my 6 inch space. I moved out of the way so he could stand at the counter and talk with a co-worker. As I was walking out the door I was asked for a receipt by a security person who walked by a heard the conversation about me not having a receipt. When I asked for a manager a lady name, ""Tammy"" came to talk with me who said, she would follow up to see what happened about get back with me.She took down no information. She did say sorry that I felt discriminated against. She was very unconcerned with what I was saying to her as well! I have never been refused service for not having a receipt especially when a credit card was used. I know they think ALL black people steal. However, I work at a shelter and I watch people come in with gear from Walmart who do not work. They have shared how one person steals and another person takes it back. I will never pre-correct them again. My words will be get them from now on. Horrible experience all the way around!! I have never felt discriminated against like I felt on Wednesday.",0,1

Walmart,Do not order fragile items from Walmart online,"I've ordered many things online from many places but I've never had fragile stuff busted to pieces until I ordered from Walmart.com.

Unlike other places I've ordered from, they don't wrap or pad the glass items. They just throw a couple of air pillows in the side of the box.

Walmart,Worst Online Customer Service I've Had,"My credit card was lost or stolen and they had not processed my payment yet, so I knew that it would not process and wanted to change the payment method. I requested to be emailed and was supposed to be emailed within 48 minutes per their estimate -- they didn't respond for over 24 hours so I could not wait that long. After 2 hours, I called and was told that the change of payment would not be possible. I was then hung up on with no call back. I got on customer service chat and was supposed to be transferred to billing / accounting, but no one ever responded. I cancelled my order and have been looking elsewhere for the product. When they eventually responded to my email request after over 24 hours, I informed them of how disappointed I was -- no response to my complaints. I furthermore responded to emails asking about how my experience was on both my customer service requests and the specific transaction. I left detailed comments on my dissatisfaction. It's been half a month, and no one has reached out. This was one of the worst online shopping customer service experiences I've ever had.

I walked out of there pretty sad because it just felt like I was being scolded and attacked for no reason. Once again this was at the Deptford Walmart in New Jersey and the workers name was cancella.

Walmart,I will never order from Walmart online…,"I will never order from Walmart online ever again. I ordered online for an in-store pick up and all it has done is cost me time. I went to pick up my online order at my local Walmart, Thinking it would be quick and easy and 45 minutes later I walked out without the items I ordered. This is your only brought out one item from my order and I asked him where my other item was and he was clueless. He told me to hold on and he went and got a general manager and they couldn’t figure out if the item was in the store, being shipped to the store, or is out of stock completely. They asked me to go about my day and they would have the manager call me. The manager never called me I had to call her. After I spoke with her and she had no idea where the item was I had to call The one 800 number. The gentleman from a one 800 number told me it would be two weeks for the item to be delivered. I asked for a refund because I ordered the item I anticipated that it was available for in-store pick up. He told me no problem and he would refund me. Several weeks go by and I check my Discover card and I have not received my $50 refund. So I have to call again to the 1-800 Number, go through all the prompts and wait on hold to hopefully get a refund. So all this time and energy and phone calls and trip to Walmart for an item I never got.... but I got charged for, and a refund I was supposed to get but I’m still waiting on.

Still no delivery, after waiting for any form of contact for over an hour I call and cancel, explaining the frustration with the situation. 15 minutes later get a phone call wondering if I was going to pick up my order!!! First of all-it was a delivery which had been cancelled because y'all couldn't get your stuff together.

Your embarrassing yourselves and making things more complicated than need be!",0,1
Walmart,"Unreliable delivery, poor tracking, waste of time","I ordered three times from Walmart this month. Not once did they deliver on time (when THEY said they would). The first of the three times they canceled after a day, stating the product was out of stock. Why did it take a day for them to determine that after I spent an hour searching and asserting they had a good price? I had to find the product at another vendor and order it again.The second of the three times they promised to deliver a product in two days. That was essential b/c I needed it for a trip I was taking in three days. The product was not delivered before I left 2.75 days later. When I got home from my trip the package was on my porch. I had to return the package unopened as it was no longer needed. That is when I learned about the return shipping policy. They use US Postal Service, and the system is not as convenient or reliable as Amazon returns, in my experience. For example, there is no links provided to arrange the return. They do provide a return label, but you have to arrange the return separately with the USPS, which has its own reliability issues (I arrange for them to retrieve the package on a certain day, but they did not come, so I had to arrange it a second time).The third time I ordered from Walmart this month was two days ago. The package was supposed to arrive ""by the end of the day"" yesterday. It did not arrive, which is why I'm writing this review. Their delivery provides a tracking number. But unlike other package tracking services, this provides minimal information that is hardly useful. It only indicates the time the package was shipped and the deadline for meeting their shipping agreement. The arrival deadline is provided when the product was ordered, so that is not helpful. Importantly, there are no updates when the package is late, so if you need something, you are in a bind. So their tracking system is essentially useless.The only reason to buy from Walmart is sometimes their prices are lower than Amazon or other online vendors. But the time I have wasted just this month suggests the few bucks I would have saved is not close to the value of the time I wasted dealing with them. I will avoid them in the future.",0,1

It does not take much to increase the buying pars of product that sells out quickly. The majority of cashiers never smile, never look up or thank the customer when cashing out. There are a maybe 4 or 5 employees who are customer friendly. Even the employees on the floor do not know there product. Every time I ask one for a certain product, I usually get the same response. "" we are out"" then as I search the store, I find what I was looking for and it was not ""out"". On days of the month when business is busy, they have limited cashiers and these are in the lanes with limited 20 items or less. The city of Yelm is small and Walmart knows they have the monopoly of being the only department store in town and they act like it too.

Walmart,Bad info and lack of service,"I wanted to pick up a few items the next day that would be used in my office so I went online found the Walmart that was closest to my office and selected a couple items. I only selected this Wal-Mart because it said curbside pickup. I even verified it was pick up when I checked out. Needless to say I got to the store and not only did I have to go inside to get my stuff, pick up was way in the back far corner of the store. Since I have a problem wearing a mask I have been using curbside pickup when available. So not only did I have to put on a mask to go into the store, I had to go all the way through the entire store to the back corner and ask multiple people where the pickup was before I could find it. Then because there are no carts in the back at pickup, I had to carry my box of merchandise all the way out of the store, no one offered to help, and then to my truck. Needless to say I am very upset with Walmart, number one, the website was wrong, but number two, I can't believe that this is one of the only Walmarts around that I could find that doesn't do curbside pickup. When I inquired inside I was told, oh we'll have curbside pickup in October. Okay is this the only Walmart that is this far behind because the Walmart I normally go to has had curbside pickup for quite a while. Also disappointed that not 1 employee offered to help me carry the box or find me a cart. I will never return to this store and I will be sure everyone I know hears about this lack of clear, courteous service.",0,1

Walmart,Lack of stock and diversity with My Life As Dolls,"I have to say the Walmart store in Monroeville, Al has such a tiny My Life As section. The selection of their line of 18"" dolls is even tinier. As someone who's in the toy community I find their selection and lack of diversity appalling. More often than not this store seems to get shipments of one style of doll over the others. I know I can't be the only one aware of the channel ""My World"" on Youtube run by Melissa Hunter, who was sponsored by Walmart to do a video to promote their products. She was sent to a Walmart store which had quite a diverse variety of their doll line as well as pretty much every option of doll that came out in 2019. She is also sent many My Life As dolls for free to review on her channel, in all varieties I might add. (The newest being all three variations of the new Hello Kitty doll, also not available at my local store) I find it sad. Who is really at fault here?

Trade who denied my claim stating it wasn't covered. An ice maker machine leaking water is not covered and we had the machine less than a year!!

She remained silent for over 20 seconds. I asked her more than once why it was rejected. Very nasty attitude. When I told her I was very frustrated and annoyed and I feel like I would not shop with them again after spending thousands of dollars with walmart over the years, she asked me if there is anything else I needed or if that was it.

Walmart,Walmart double charges credit hold amount,"I'm specifically reviewing the grocery order/pickup service. I've used it for probably a couple of years, twice a month. My most recent order was a disaster. Typically, and understandably, they put a hold on the card used to pay for the order, with the final total charged when the order is picked up. No problem. Until this order when they did a double hold that they were not able (supposedly) to correct. I was able to remove one hold by canceling the order, but the other one remains on my account. My bank says they can't remove it without authorization from Walmart and Walmart says they can't request it to be removed because it's not showing in their system. They admitted that this is an intermittent problem that they've not been able to fix in their system. One of the customer service reps I contacted said that calls that day had been ""trending"" with this same problem.So be aware that this huge corporation won't hire programmers capable of fixing this known problem which can mean that customers don't have access to their own funds for DAYS, until this drops off the account due to age. Consider if they do this at an average of $150 per customer victim, times a few thousand or more customers, how much money they are causing to be held /frozen.In my case, that is grocery budget money that I can't use. It's caused me to have to make a second trip for what I couldn't buy on my regular shopping trip due to not being able to spend my own money. I've only been going out twice a month due to covid19 with my husband being a high risk, so we try to keep exposure as low as possible. But of course Walmart doesn't care at all.As soon as this gets cleared up (we're on day 3 now,) I'll be removing my card info from Walmart.com and will cease doing business with them. They won't care, but at least I'll never have to deal with this aggravation again.",0,1

Walmart,This is the worst Walmart in the effing…,This is the worst Walmart in the effing world. The one in Exton is so much better & they hire people THAT AREN'T ASS holes.These people at the Walmart in oaks WOULD NOT LET ME LEAVE THE STORE. They held me against my will inside when Even if I was stealing They’re not allowed to hold me in their store without knowing for sure that I walked out of the store with stealing products. So what I did was I said there’s no way in hell I’m giving these rude ass people my money so I turned around when they wouldn’t let me leave the store to go put everything back that I did not scan. The big huge guy that’s literally has no life and lives there was extremely rude to me after I told him countless times what the situation was and I am a white women & my boyfriend is black and unfortunately this mixture Tends to create attention when that’s not fair. Thinking back on it I wish I called the cops on these people for not letting me leave the store and put the back that I picked out that I refuse to pay for it because of how I was treated as well as my boyfriend so you people at the Walmart in Oaks on trooper Road can go screw your selfs. There was ONE LADY THERE THAT WORKED THERE THAT STOOD UP FOR ME. She saw me crying over the situation bc I have had SUCH A BAD week that I was not At all in the mood to be harassed by the lady that was scanning twice that I already scanned of the stuff I picked out in the self check out and this is standing behind me on my shoulder scanning for me that I already scanned and these people deserve to be arrested so I may still call the cops. I was harassed and you guys can go somewhere with your Dirty ass non showering people. The fact that I saw a sign at Walmart forcing people to wear deodorant before they walk in I mean what the Walmart has no right to be in any of their customers lives that way. The ONE nice lady made it a priority to say “god bless you” Mostly because she works with these people and she knows how they treat their own employees let alone someone that spends $300 at Walmart weekly!!! And this is how they do me. Go yourselves @walmartOnTrooperROAD. Calling the police department to see what I can do. Not to mention their racist as hell towards white people . Jealous ass coming up behind my shoulders? It’s different when someone is just generally stealing but it’s another thing when the employee is staring you down and coming up behind you to scan things another time for you she scanned three things that I already had scanned she took them out of my bag and scan them again and I told her not to multiple times because I already paid for it and she kept doing it anyway so I definitely got to make sure she gets hers for thatthe lady was sneaking up behind my shoulder and taking my stuff out of the bags and re-scanning them claiming that I didn't scan them and they were already scanned and I proved it to her and she never apologized NOT ONCE. So I took the items That I had picked out so that I would not give them any more of my money and I ran to put everything back and they stopped me and wouldn’t let me do it and it’s my right to do what the hell I want with what I decided to buy and what I want to go put back I don’t want any of your not asked help seriously these people are disgusting and I hope someone learns to take a shower soon that works there.

Walmart,Why order online when you have to pick up orders at the store.,"Why Walmart won’t get my delivery service again. When you order online some items can only be picked up at the store. You get a message saying item is ready. You have to walk in and scan your item. Sometimes the irem is delivered to you through the machine. Sometimes in a locker bear the kiosk and sometimes they have to have someone deliver it to you. Today, mine was delivered to me by a person. After 10 minutes and no person arriving I scanned again. Waited 10 more minutes and called the store to see what the hold up was. Had I not ordered online, I could have picked it up, paid and been out the door. My time is more valuable than waiting for someone to do work that I could have done faster myself. Online ordering does not save customers time.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart managers don't like there customers,"I received an email today saying someone went on the Walmart Online and tried to use my Walmart credit card to make a purchase. Luckily I didn't have enough in my account for it to go through so the email stated ""purchase decline for insufficient funds"" so I called the number on the back of the card and took care of having Capitol One cancel the card and then went on the Walmart.com and changed my password. I call Walmart customer service to see if I can find out what they tried to purchase and if anything where they were making that purchase from. So after having to listen to a long drawn out automated voice for a good 5 minutes I finally get a human. I explained why I was calling and the steps I have already taken. She asked for the credit card number so I gave it to her, three times because it was obvious she couldn't understand me and couldn't understand what I was inquiring about. So I asked for a supervisor. Another 10 minutes gone by and I get Paula. I again explained the situation and she asked for my credit card number. After the second time she says that maybe I need to speak to Walmart Grocery to see if any denied transactions showed up there. Here's what I learned. Walmart is not prepared to handle fraud actions. When calling customer service there is no option of ""disputing a transaction"" or even a ""if you believe someone was using your card with no authorization"". No you get a bunch of babble from the automated voice when you first call then more babble by the reps and supervisor. After being told by the supervisor that she could not access the ""grocery"" side of Walmart I explained how ridiculous that is that a manager doesn't have access to all the customers info and transaction regardless of what department. So I said go ahead and transfer me to grocery and then I was hung up on. I never raised my voice, or used foul language. Just hung up on by a Walmart manager. I think Walmart and I are done doing business.",0,1

One thing I am not is a thief and they have the nerve to sop me or anyone else and treat them like they are stealing something. It is so embarrassing them going through your things. They have no right nor the authority to go through anyone’s things. Plus being followed through the store because your dirty from working all day and just because of the way a person looks they will follow you to see if you’re stealing.

I informed him that I can't wear a mask due to the laws on concealed carry and I had my pistol on me,I was then told he didn't care about the laws on guns and to take my kids and leave.. it is unacceptable to be treated that way and it needs to be fixed now. I had my kids asking if it was because we are white and he was Mexican and I told my kids I hope that's not why he treated is like that but I don't know. Not everyone is able to wear a face covering due to health or religion and it's wrong to force a customer to leave not knowing or caring to know the situation. I believe if someone can't have a face covering then they must do self checkout, not thrown out of a store with their kids. People need to open their eyes and see this is the work of the devil and me and my household will follow God and his word,God says ""help one another"" not kick them out with their kids. This one a manager who needs more training and respect. He could have asked what we needed to get and could've helped us get it so we wouldn't be inside long but instead he made the choice to get in my face in front of my kids and talk to me like a nobody and I thought Walmart had better customer service than that? Very very disappointed in Walmart right now and won't go back till I get an apology and able to get the things me and my kids needed.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart does NOTHING to help customers…,"Walmart did nothing to help customers during March April and May with the pandemic. Useless.

It said several local stores had the item in stock but I still called. I was told stores cannot check to see if an item is actually in stock - had to go in. I drove the distance and went into a not all that clean store and of course they didn’t have the item. I called 800# customer service and was told they couldn’t do anything. Not one thing. I asked a supervisor if if she could call the next store which supposedly had the item in stock. It was a 45 minute drive away. She refused saying it’s “not part of the process.” So I drove and couldn’t find the item. I waited at the customer service area for over 5 minutes while nobody else was in line but the 2 guys behind the counter were talking and laughing and had no interest in helping me. I stayed patient. Finally they stopped talking and I was called up to the counter and yet again the store didn’t have the item. 4 calls to customer service resulted in no help whatsoever. I had a list of items to get at Walmart along with what I went for - something I promised my granddaughter I’d get - their website says stores have it.

Walmart,Do Not Buy From Wal-Mart’s Third Party Vendors,"Buying online from Wal-Mart was a terrible experience, and I do not recommend you buy anything from their 3rd party vendors online.I ordered what was described as a “9x13 stainless steel cake pan”. When the cake pan arrived, it was larger than 9x13 and was indented on the bottom, so it will not work for making my decorated cakes. It looks like a large roasting pan.I tried to return the pan to Wal-Mart in person, only to be told, the pan was from a 3rd party, so I would have to contact the third party to return it. I didn’t know Wal-Mart used third parties on their website. I looked on my receipt, and the company name of the 3rd party is written in very tiny print, with nothing to indicate Wal-Mart does not accept returns from third party vendors. Buyer beware!The company that supplied the cake pan has been a nightmare to work with. First they told me I had to go to the post office to get a quote for returning the pan. I live in a very small town. I told them I’m handicapped, and that the street in front of the post office is under construction. They still insisted I get a quote or they wouldn’t take the pan back. Needless to say, I couldn’t use my walker on the rough terrain, and I took a bad fall in front of the post office.After getting a quote, they asked me to return the pan and told me they would pay for shipping. I mailed the pan back, and have been fighting for over 2 months trying to get my refund. I’ve emailed them 11 times trying to get the price of the pan and shipping refunded. The price of the pan was $95.37, and shipping was $20.64. They finally refunded $83.18 for a pan that I paid $95.37 for. I’ve been trying to get shipping refunded and they’ve asked me for my PayPal password in order to refund it. I contacted PayPal, and because the shipping wasn’t paid for through PayPal, they can’t help me. They told me that I should never give my password to anyone, and that the company is trying to scam me.I also tried to contact Wal-Mart, to ask for help getting the rest of my money refunded. It was very difficult finding their customer service information, but PayPal provided me with their email and phone number. I emailed and asked Wal-Mart for help, but they haven’t replied. I called customer service and was told, it’s between the third party vender and me and that they don’t stand behind their third party venders, unlike Amazon that guarantee all of their items. Buyer Beware! MANY items on Wal-Mart’s website are not sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart will not assist you if you have a problem with their vendors. I just got scammed out of $32.83 and the third party vendor tried to get my PayPal confidential information. Wal-Mart will not help me get the rest of my money returned, and they will not remove the company from their website. It’s been 4 months since I contacted Wal-Mart, but the 3rd party vendor is still selling the pan on their website, and it’s still described incorrectly as a 9x13 cake pan.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart's delivery service kind of sucks,I've used Walmart's delivery service three times now. The first time was for a fairly large grocery order. The thing that bugged me most about it was they they charge you for the order at the time you submit it even if the items may not be available. then as they fill your order making substitutions they make adjustments to your debit or credit card for the amounts individually. The charges to my card kept going up and down and changing. It took me a week watching my bank account to make sure that they got it all right. Ultimately they did and the only complaint I had left on the first order was one non grocery item was not what I ordered. so I had to go to the store anyway and return that item for a refund because they couldn't actually point me to the correct item on the shelf anywhere.In filling my second order they substituted like five items. Three of the five weren't even substitutions. they were totally different items. The other two items were so common I swear to God it was just laziness. I decided that I would check the box for no substitutions the next time I order just to avoid getting things that I had no use for that weren't even close to the item I actually ordered. My third order just arrived. Duda no substitutions I got exactly what I ordered.there were two items unavailable which is comical because when was a deli item sliced ham for sandwich meat. But okay at least I didn't get no sliced turkey as a substitution. But this I order was missing two items. So I went into the app follow the directions found the item check the box explained what was wrong and was told that I couldn't get a refund online I had to wait on hold on the telephone. only to speak to a barely English-speaking person who told me that it would take three to five days to get my $5 back instead of telling me they were going to ship me the two items that were missing. I found a comical that it would take three to five days because they debited and credited my card like five times on my first order making adjustments. So in short if you have very little time and Zen control of your temper this isn't a bad service. But it's inconsistent and frustrating and it seems to me so far that you're never going to be exactly happy with the outcome each time,0,2

Walmart,Why did I open a product to see if it fit?,"I bought a foam topper to go on top of my mattress in March 2020. There were no signs saying this item was not returnable or I would never have bought it. I brought it home and opened the package. It was one of those packages that is tightly packed into a piece of plastic that is about the size of a large pillow. However; when you open it--it springs open and is a very large, unwieldy item. I have a queen size mattress so of course I bought a queen size foam topper. The topper was at best a double. I immediately tried to refold the foam and had to put it in a large garbage bag because it does not fold into anything small. I took it back to the store and was told that because I had opened it--I can't return it. They keep telling me that I shouldn't have opened it. I keep saying that there is no possible way I could have known the product was the wrong size unless I opened it. I have also pointed out it is not my fault their product was incorrectly tagged as queen when it was not. I have been driving around this piece of foam in my car trunk since March now and I am really tired of it. I don't have room to store it in my place. I also still need a piece of foam for my bed because that is why I bought one in the first place. I won't buy another one because I don't trust it would be the right size. I understand that these are Covid times, but I think it is ridiculous that I should have to do this and not even be able to get an exchange. Wal-Mart can afford to take the loss more than I can, and they were the ones selling a defective product in the first place. I phoned the customer service centre and got the automated message, so I pressed 0 to talk to a representative. No one ever answered. I tried all of their departments and no one answered. I phoned another Wal-Mart and the same thing happened. I phoned a third one who did answer and then said I shouldn't have opened the product. Insanity. I would give them zero stars if I could.",0,1

Walmart emailed me a confirmation that it was delivered and charged my credit card for it but I never received the item. When I called Customer Service about this, all they could say was “Call your bank to refute the charges”. I’ve called 4 times with issues in the last month. The customer service reps are also rude and completely useless, why is Walmart wasting their money paying them to sit there and be unhelpful?Do NOT use their service and if you do track the charges. I’m switching over to Fortinos for my groceries now, they are more expensive and their Pick Up has a minimal charge but it’s worth it to avoid getting charged hundreds of dollars over your actual amount.

Walmart,"Poor Customer Service Standards, No more 3 Meter Rule","There are many reasons which prompted me to write this review. Out of many bad experiences encountered, there were two incidences at Walmart Store 3162, 80 Buchanan Drive, PE, unfortunately, the second one just after the first.I am a regular customer at the said store and my normal monthly spending exceeding CAD 1500. I was appalled by the way the checkout staffs' treatment directed at certain customers. It seems that they have been instructed to apply the ""Walmart 3 meter rule"", only for certain customers. I was saddened to see that the caucasian person in front of me greeted and just frowned at when I reached for check out. Me being a visible minority found this disturbing and racist. I believe this is not what Canada and Walmart stand for. I did once confront an agent she said and I quote, ""I am having a bad day"". Well, it seems to be funny she just started to have her bad day after I reached there. Then she was mocking me by repeated saying Good morning! How are you?. Then yesterday was a similar incident despite being the first to greet the staff with a friendly "" Good morning"" the person didn't even bother to reply back. It is they who should be greeting the customers first. Unfortunately, I don't have the receipt for the incident the week earlier but I have the TC# 0712 0162 2720 4521 8142 for yesterday.I find this behavior to be common among the new recruits from the same visible minority.Either it is the recruitment of staff by people unqualified or Walmart has decided to do away with their customer-friendly 3-meter rule.",0,1

They gave me a 50 GC (a total joke) after many calls and still made me feel as if I was trying to profit out of them, when they forgot all they had put me through and my ruptured relationship with my client was all their fault and their negligence to make things right for a customer.",0,1

The security guard doesn't wear his properly, wasn't he instructed in the proper way to wear one frim management? He has it barely covering his mouth, as his nostrils are flaring when he yaps with customers! He should be setting the example of the proper way to cover your face, instead he thanked me for my comments and continued to yap with customers while exposing us all to possible droplets coming out of his nose! Half of employees still have their masks drooped around their chins, as well as some shoppers, but dont ask them to wear it properly, you will become the bad guy who should mind his or her own business! When other customers tell me that I reply, I hope you enjoy your Covid19 Hospital stay!",0,1

Walmart,Worst customer service anywhere!,Worst customer service anywhere.I bought a lawnmower battery. It won't keep a charge even when it's out of the mower. I accessed the receipt on the iPhone app and started a return and bring it to customer service. They scan it and tell me it's a battery and I need to bring it to auto. Brought it to auto and they don't know how to scan it in. Wait 15 minutes for a supervisor who can't help either. I call customer service and explain this and the transfer me to Store Customer relations. They can't help with an app problem and transfer me back to customer service. They try to call the store with me on the line and after 18 rings they hang up on me. Walmart hires incompetent people who can't process a simple return for a defective product. Shop at your own risk. They just stole $44.95 from me an refused to help. Thank God it wasn't a television!,0,1
Walmart,Lousy customer service and order delivery,"Placed an order for next day delivery, received confirmations it was to be delivered, but never arrived. Called to inquire, was given the run-around and told it would be here tomorrow (3rd day). I needed the order yesterday as promised when I ordered. They shipped via FedEx -(terrible mistake) I called them first and was given the run-around, then called WalMart. First CSR advised he would have to look into it and then bumped it up to a higher level, 2nd CSR said they were not responsible for shipper default then put me back to first CSR who told me he would be glad to discuss my options with me. Rather than try to engage in conversation with someone I could barely understand, I told him I didn't care what he did and that I was calling AmEx, refusing the charge and Walmart could find the shipment and do whatever the heck they had to get their merchandise returned to them. This is supposed to be a service for the customer but it is anything but. This is a one and done for me.",0,1

Walmart,The Commerce City Colorado  Walmart on 5990…,"The Commerce City Walmart on 5990 Dahlia Drive has the worst customer service of any Walmart in the Denver area. I called three times to speak to the manager, Edward, and each time no one picked up, and there was no voicemail to leave a message with. Edward doesnt seem to care about how his store employees treat customers or how badly his store reflects on Walmart.Today, for the 3rd day in a row, the self checkout machines are not accepting cash. NONE OF THEM. This is leading to incredibly long lines at the 2 staffed checkout stations that take cash.There was only one staff member at the self checkout stations when I was there today, Saturday, July 11th, at 12:32 pm. She was incredibly angry and rude. I understand that walmart workers are stressed out because of the covid pandemic, but guess what? I'm unemployed, so I'm stressed out too! This is not a walmart problem. This is a Commerce City Walmart problem. The store on 7101 E 128th Avenue, Brighton, CO 80652 provides a completely different experience. The staff there are polite, and respectful, and patient given the situation we are all facing. ""Edward"" the manager at the Commerce City Walmart doesnt seem to care about how this stores customer service problems or how it reflects on walmart as an organization.It's sad I have to drive 15 miles and 25 minutes out of my way instead of the Walmart in Commerce City just 2 miles from my house.

Walmart,As people say,"As people say, everyone has there own opinion. I feel it is absolutely ridiculous that walmarts are not accepting returns on clothing with the orginial tags on them. Along with not allowing the people to try them on, since the fitting rooms are CLOSED! Customers are coming in and touching everything in site with our bodies, our fingers touch everything in site. It is totally ridiculous. I have contacted the corporate offices in this matter, but of course it not the person fault who answers the phone .

I haven't always had a successful order/delivery but I have always had very good customer service. I dont' think it's been Walmart's fault when there have been issues; it's usually been linked to delivery to one of their suppliers so as far as I'm concerned, Walmart is great, they do their job, they do it expediently and they have great customer service.

Walmart,1st I must ask:,"1st I must ask: IS ANYONE OUT THERE? DOES ANYONE REALLY CARE? Walmart makes it easy to shop, but next to impossible to comment or complain. I have shopped Walmart for over 40 years. I have been more than satisfied for 34 to 35 of those year; however, over the last 5 or 6 years I have built greater and greater bad feelings. They boil up and boil up but remain unsatisfied. I know that over time prices must raise. While this is frustrating, that's life. Over the last 5 or 6 years I have seen items removed from the shelves that were staples to my shopping. I wrote it off as, ""It's not on the shelves because it's not selling."" Of course the adage, ""It's not selling because it's not on the shelves,"" comes to mind. When items I wanted disappear, I talk to local Walmart employees. I always get polite answers but no satisfaction. Mostly, it's ""I don't know, That's not my department, or I'll look into that."" Then, they vanish. I have filed my concerns on the internet but like Walmart employees they seem to vanish also. There are other issues I have with Walmart but they have nothing to do with your products or service. They concern social issues and lawlessness. I agree that Black Lives Matter. I even affirm that All Lives Matter. However, it is my belief that your corporation is suffering from moral cowardice. Like other companies Walmart is giving into fear of the mob. Walmart may think that it is taking the moral high ground, but I suspect their stance has more to do with trying to stave off damage to their stores from mob violence than any sense of justice. I believe that they are an appeaser pleaser with no courage to take an ethical stand. In the end appeasement is more dangerous than a serial killer or any foreign army Appeasement will kill what's right with this country faster than any war.",0,2

It is great when you can feel the empathy on the other side of the phone. People like that are needed in this world to make this a better place.

We aren't allowed to visit because of Covid19. We tried to exchange them at our local Walmart for a smaller size. The tags were still on them. The customer service rep said no. We explained the situation and no luck. I said I will retrieve my mastercard copy as proof because the shirts were the only item purchased it is the correct total. She said no we could have bought something else for the same amount and then said loudly you could have stolen them. First the greeter who was counting people saw us enter with the bag and walk directly to customer service. Second the shirts are 3 times the size of my husband who was with me, why steal shirts too big and then let us leave with the""stolen goods"". This isn't the first incidence of accusations of stealing. A month ago in a Niagara Falls Walmart my husband walked our cart towards a display at the front of the store to get the item and an employee ran up yelling you can't take that stuff. I complained to head office and got an auto response that they would reply within 24 hours. It is now 3 days later and no response. The good thing is the Walmart in Hamilton on Rymal was appalled at our treatment, used the mastercard receipt to look up the purchase because we had already replaced the shirts I got a refund.

I purchased a roku for 26$ on 07/01 then I get it home to find out the remote doesn't work so I assumed it was the batteries and used my other roku remote then quickly realized this was a roku that was previously returned as it had Netflix profiles still on it. I retured it on 07/02 and the roku I exchanged it for was exactly the same but they were charging me 29.88 for it. I asked why should i have to pay the difference. The manager at Syracuse walmart said our prices change all the time it's only a few dollars, really!!! A few dollars wow. So not only in a pandemic where people are already struggling your going to expect me to pay more for a product you clearly put back on the shelf after it was already returned but I always do grocery pick up. So now I'm risking myself with covid having a high risk family member by having to go into the store and exchange this roku. There was no apology for the item that had been returned they were rude about it and acted like I was wrong for being upset. I'm starting to think this is Walmart's policy because it's not the first time I have bought something that been returned. Your not only wasting my time but your wasting other people's time that have to stand in line behind me or anyone else that has a item that was already returned and defective. I'm very disappointed and upset about the way I was treated. These employees need a retraining on how to treat customers with better customer service when it is their mistake.",0,1
Walmart,Wal-Mart Shipping Is A Joke,"Wal-Mart shipping is a joke! I just received a package in the mail, and Wal-Mart quite literally threw all of my items, which are quite heavy, all on top of one another, in a huge pile! They also threw many heavy items on top of one another, on top of a box of wheat crackers, which is of course at the very bottom of the box. Wal-Mart literally made zero effort to package my items, a child would know better. It almost looks as if a disgruntled employee was mad at the company and took it out on my order. I did not pay good money to receive a beat up roasting pan, a beat up box of crackers, and a smashed pack of tuna. I have not opened the box of crackers, though as they were at the very bottom, I am sure quite a few of them are smashed to bits. I shook the box a bit and I can definitely tell several of the crackers are in pieces. A few of the other boxes of tuna look rough also. To top it all off, FedEx delivered my package to the wrong address, and then initially tried to blame Wal-Mart. So, I had to go through a lot to even track down my order. Though when ordering from other companies, FedEx has not given me this sort of trouble. Wal-Mart sure is going down hill..I will never purchase another order from Wal-Mart again. I do not believe I can post pictures of the order on this website, otherwise I would. I have taken several pictures of the order.

I called to see what was going on and the customer service rep stated the delivery company only delivers Mon-Fri. I was NOT happy because that's not what the website stated. Had I knew that, I would've NEVER ordered from you. At that point there was nothing more I could do, but wait. Monday rolls around, I get an email stating my package was delivered. It was odd because it required a signature and I know I didn't sign for it. I had my daughter go out to check the porch and there was no TV in sight. I called Walmart, they transferred me to FedEX and what would you know, my package was delivered to the wrong house!! Someone signed for my package that I never even heard of.

Walmart,Grocery update issues,"If four kids so we use their grocery delivery service constantly several times a month especially during the pandemic. Two weeks ago (because that's how long it took to sort out) for some reason our order paused at the preparing section even though we were fully charged and the order was delivered which meant that we never got the substitution or at a stock list now this order was for just under $500 I had to go through and systematically check to see everything that was missing and it came to be about $125. I called they told me that the system would update and the next day it would be accurate and it would see delivered and we would get the refund for the stuff that they did not have in stock that didn't happen, this went on for 4 days. every single time I called I was repeatedly told that either I wasn't allowed to talk to a supervisor because there are there were none or they weren't allowed to take customer calls because they were too busy with calls to which point I asked well who were they talking to if they're not allowed to talk to customers and then I was told they don't know because right now they're working from home and have no idea who's doing what. I spoke to several different people and was told multiple times that my argument was being escalated I was given to them storm manager at the physical store several times who repeatedly asked me to give her the list of every single item and what it cost to which every time I started when she realized that this was so much stuff she would stop me and tell me that someone else would call me back and hang up on me repeatedly. The third time this happened the manager for some reason kept asking me if I wanted to speak Spanish instead I don't know why she kept doing this I kept saying no I don't speak Spanish I don't understand why you're asking me this, at which point she eventually gave me to a Spanish person seeking person who after a minute was very confused when I kept insisting that no I don't speak Spanish nor do I want to try to do that. eventually I finally got to a customer service person who ultimately did an incredibly illegal refund The amount of stuff we were missing was mostly non-food In fact I think the food total came to maybe $14 the rest was predominantly cleaning supplies and baby stuff The food stuff had been paid with food stamps but the rest was off my debit card they proceeded to do the refund based off a previous order and put all of it into food stamps so they ended up illegally putting a crap ton of money on food stamps and I still have yet to have anyone fix this.

I had to go back in their system to get the order number for her, it's the only time I ordered that item that I told her what it was. she finally got someone else who told me they could not send me a label, the first person couldn't do that much, They would give me a refund without sending it back, forget returning it.

Walmart,Looks like Walmart decided to pick a…,"Looks like Walmart decided to pick a side. This made me sick to read. Copied and pasted from a private group on FB.My husband is a good man. My husband is not perfect. My husband makes mistakes. My husband is the type of person that would help anyone at any time. My husband is a police officer. Today I watched the light in my husband and my son's eyes leave. Today I had to defend one of the bravest men I have ever met. Let's back up a bit. Today is Sunday, June 14th, 2020. Our family went to church as we do every Sunday. After church, we ran to Walmart in Grove Oklahoma. This is not unusual for our family, in fact, this is almost always a weekly trip. Someone has forgotten something and we zip over to Walmart and pick up what we need.Today changed that for our family. We will never return to Grove Walmart or any other Walmart. While in the store a message repeatedly played over the loudspeaker. This message stated that Walmart understands white privilege exist and supports Black lives matter. It went on to say how they support the black community and acknowledge the injustices committed by the law enforcement agencies. I watched my nine-year-old son whip his head around and the light goes out in my husband's eyes. We decided to leave the store. My husband was just going to leave and not say anything to anyone. But I had to show my son that his father was a good man and that sometimes we have to stand up for what is right. I asked our check out person if she would please get a manager for us. She said why maybe I can help. I said no please just call a manager. She refused. She looked at my husband and asked him to tell her why I wanted a manager. My husband replied that the message on the speaker is directly against his line of work and that it was not friendly towards the police department. She responded with I am no longer comfortable speaking with you. He said that is fine but you asked what was wrong so I told you. She said I did ask but I no longer want to know. I said that it is fine could you please call the manager my husband and I would like to speak with the manager. He is a police officer and would like to address this issue. At this time she said that she would not serve us at all because he was a police officer and she just walked away. She left us with half of our order rang up. I looked at the lady behind me with tears in my eyes and she told my husband thank you for your service. Some other checkers came and finished the purchase. A few minutes later two male employees came up. The manager asked what happened. When we told him he said that she had the right to not serve anyone. My husband agreed with that. My husband told the manager that he didn't expect Walmart to back Blue lives but he did think of the very least for impartiality. The manager proceeded to tell us that corporate feel like there are more black people than law enforcement and that money is more important to the corporation than law enforcement and their families. He said this was Walmart's corporate policy. I asked the man so Walmart is not going to support law enforcement officers at all? His response was no not as long as they were making more money from the people in this movement. So this tells me that they only care about money. The manager said that people at corporate make the decisions and they have to play the message. Another officer came up and showed his badge asked about the broadcast and we told him about how we were treated and that Walmart corporation feels that law enforcement can be refused service just for being police officers his face registered utter shock. My son was devastated. We were treated like criminals. My husband was devastated. This is what These black lives matter and defund the police is causing. This is not okay. I am a proud LEO wife, I am proud of my husband. My husband may save that lady someday but still, she will hate him.",0,1

Walmart,Awesome customer service!,"I bought an inflatable paddleboard in February from a third party seller on Walmart.com. Since it's cold in February and the beaches closed in March and April due to the global pandemic, we did not use the paddleboard until recently. The first time we tried it out in our pool and it worked great. The directions on releasing the air were very unclear but we thought we did it correctly. The second time we tried using it was at the beach last weekend. The valve appeared to be broken and the paddleboard would not maintain the correct PSI of air. I contacted the seller who informed me that it was made out of the country, the warranty had expired, and there was nothing they could do to help me. I contacted Walmart .com's customer service and asked if they stood behind the products sold through third party sellers and was there nothing they could do for me? The rep was sooo friendly and helpful. He assured me that they could help me and put me on hold. After being on hold for about 8 minutes, the rep came back and told me that they were issuing a full refund! THANK YOU, Walmart, for supporting your customers!!!",0,5
Walmart,Failed Miserably,"I had to use a delivery service for my groceries due to my health and the pandemic so I chose Wal-Mart as I know what they have at their stores. I created my cart, the delivery fee was attached and I placed my order. It was to arrive between 6-7pm and they stated that I would be notified when it arrived. I was very happy, until 6-7pm came and passed. Iwent to the front of my building, no one was there, no groceries so I called the help on the site of my Wal-Mart confirmation email. The lady told me that my order had been cancelled because something went wrong on their end and she said they sent me an email stating that. I returned to my email account, while with her on the phone, and...No...there was only my confirmation email. I asked why would they Not call me, text me or send that email...once again, she said they sent me an email and Once Again I told her No.. They Didn't. She apologized and asked if she could help me re-order my groceries.. You know, they Failed Miserably... so No...I will take my business else where...probably to Target and Food Lion.",0,1

Since the fitting rooms are closed because of the viral pandemic, I couldn't try it on at the store, so I just bought the shirt to try at home, thinking I could return the item easily. The shirt didn't fit well at all, so I tried to return it the next couple of days, but the associate tending the custoner service counter said they are not accepting returns indefinitely. Walmart should have made an advisory about this no return policy while fitting rooms are not usable, so buyers won't be tricked into buying an apparel they could not return if it won't fit.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart treats employees unfairly,"I was a relatively new hard working Walmart associate. I found out about their biased/poor treatment of employees but was focused on doing my job well. When the pandemic hit, I decided to take the leave that was offered. I am black, over 55, have underlying health conditions, live in a ""hot spot"" and learned that a coworker had contracted the virus. I was not willing to take a chance with my life or those that I love... my grandchildren and elderly mother whom I care for on occasion.I extended my leave until June 15, when the governor lifted the stay at home order. Upon my return to work I phoned in to check my work schedule and was informed that I had been terminated weeks ago. It was obvious that the manager was mad when I told her I had extended my leave to June 15, by her sharp tone and the slamming of the phone receiver before I was even finished. No notice, no reason given, fired during the pandemic. Walmart uses unfair, biased and predjudiced practices in the treatment of their employees.

CS came up in the loud speaker saying customer needs assistance in the vacuum department. He returned, saying someone would be there shortly. After about 15 mins waiting there, I walked to CS and explained the situation. An employee called for someone from that department to come to customer service and again no one showed up. She went to talked to her supervisor and the supervisor asked her to get my name and phone number and they would contact me back because they don’t have the key. 🤦🏾‍♂️ no one likes people wasting their time.

I called the store and offered to pick it up, was told ""no, we already ordered the driver is there anything else""? Her tone was so nasty and Im so disgusted with this experience. Also several of the gluten free items were substituted with reg items, which is a waste. I will just have to go back to shopping at several stores.",0,1

Walmart says their computer system prevents the return and only through the contract company can one expect the right package.A bait and switch is obvious, give your possible unsuspecting customer something you had for a while as they won't know. But, often we do.Compare this store with A... and C..., any number of others too numerous to name. Buy elsewhere, receive what you ordered and get customer service rather than customer no service, receipt or not.This company online dept doesn't even deserve a 1.So, customers, buyer be ware.",0,1

Walmart,I'll try to be succinct,"I'll try to be succinct. This has happened several times. I will never order from Walmart again. I used to get their groceries and last time they canceled my order without notifying me first and without explanation. Recently I ordered curtains as I'm waiting and waiting I get an email today saying they canceled my order. I find this unacceptable. I told them so. I'm more than done with Walmart. They never even offer an incentive for me to shop there so I'm taking my business to Target and/or Meijer. (I've spent over $1,000 at Watmart the last few months). I just find this practice totally unacceptable.",0,1
Walmart,I have been with Wal-Mart pick up since…,"I have been with Wal-Mart pick up since it started. At first it was absolutely fabulous. But it has steadily declined. I will be told online that an item is not available, only to go into the store and find it available with a tag behind the price tag saying out of stock online. In the beginning they chose fabulous substitutes, ones that made sense, ones that put the customer first. Now their substitutions either don't make sense or clearly is putting the company ahead of its customers.Example, I ordered gluten free waffles and the substitute is regular waffles. Such a replacement is plain dumb. Just reject the substitute, you say? The little device they are trying to read from and tell you what substitution was usually doesn't give all the information or they can't even read it and they say something like, ""Replaced with another brand."". Example of putting the company first: I once ordered packs of Crayola paint, It was the middle-of-the-line brand. I could have ordered RoseArt, Crayola, or Prang. They replaced with the lower brand of RoseArt instead of going up a brand. In the beginning, they would have chosen the Prang, the upper brand.I could go on to infinity and beyond on such bad replacement choices and putting the company first replacement choices. Then I tried Wal-Mart delivery service, which requires a premium of $12.95 a month, plus asks for tips for the delivery person. I was fine with all of that if the service was good. It was terrible. I cancelled the service before my trial period ended.I left a note stating that the driver was to knock and put the groceries inside my house. I did not give permission to drop and leave. Drop and leave is what was done the first time. I had frozen items that could have been ruined had I not heard the rummaging of bags and the dogs barking. The second time he was going to drop and leave, but I caught him and told him to bring it inside, which he did. Both delivery times, there were substitutions that were made that were not stated on my order is ready receipt. I could not reject them, as the driver doesn't handle that. I could not return them due to Covid-19 policy changes. I would NOT recommend Wal-Mart delivery service at all. I would recommend Wal-Mart pickup service with some reservation. Always ask to see your substitutions and your produce. If you don't, you'll surely be sorry time and again.",0,2

Walmart,My daughter recently did a self check…,My daughter recently did a self check out with several items. She was leaving and they did the receipt check. They scanned every item in her bag. She missed one small item worth 2 dollars. When she realized it she was mortified and wanted to rectify it. They immediately took her in back and treated her like a criminal and banned her for 90 days. Might as well have made it forever because neither her or anyone in my family will go there now. I hope it was worth losing thousands of dollars of my business over a 2 dollar item. Shameful.,0,1
Walmart,Total runaround trying to find my lost order,"I did an on line order in March. It still hasn't arrived, I have phoned and e-mailed. I was told to call a wide variety of numbers, all long distance, who all gave me other numbers to call. Tried to talk to Walmart Mastercard, they won't do anything because it was longer than 30 days (it was going to take longer than 30 days to get the order), I was given a tracking number which says there is nothing to track and THEN one of the reps told me the item is coming from a 3rd party seller in China and I should call them! Still no sign of my order oh, but they want me to pay the bill. I am very disappointed and will not use this service again.",0,1

Walmart,"Part of order missing? Walmart says: sorry, try calling the manufacturer","Bought a window A/C unit from Walmart in the US, it came with parts missing, including the remote control. I immediately contacted Walmart, they said they were very sorry, and that there was nothing they could do about it other than give me the manufacturer's phone number (I contacted the manufacturer, which is based in Canada, they never responded.) My order was placed at Walmart.com, I paid Walmart directly, yet they simply pass the buck to some 3rd party company who's name the customer has never previously heard. Walmart could have opted to contact the manufacturer themselves to get the missing remote, but they apparently felt the effort was my responsibility. This Walmart practice of taking your money, and then accepting no responsibility for the fulfillment of your order, should be illegal...it is certainly unethical.",0,1
Walmart,Employees can't ever answer questions when ever asked where an item is,"Everytime I ask an employee a question, 99% of the time they are clueless. I wanted to re-up my TracFone and asked why they don't have $125 dollar plan. Given story they must not gualify for it. Went to Target and employee went online and got the plan I wanted .It didn't go through the first time and he went out of his way to resolve it. It makes me sick that the Walton family is wealthy by hiring under quailified people because they pay so badly and many part time to avoid benefits. The store in my area has 12 or more check outs and there is only 3 open no matter when you go. Self checkouts just cut overhead even more. When they first opened first few years had alot of cashiers but I'm glad to see people don't want be subjected to unlivable wages. Also posted complaint to Corporate Headquarters about sanitary conditions during Covid-19 outbreak and obviously a human does not even read it as response was sorry your order is delayed. I hope eventually the way they operate will be their undoing.",0,1
Walmart,Closing their TLE department for no…,"Closing their TLE department for no reason blaming it all on the pandemic. First excuse was they are waiting for the Florida Governor to send them permission to reopen TLE. I contacted the Governors office personally to find out that is a lie. Second excuse is that their waiting area is to small to practice social distancing. Really? Customers can either shop in the store or drop off the car. There is no reason why the waiting area cannot be roped off not allowing customers to sit in there. 90% of TLE customers shop while they wait. Another lame excuse. Walmart needs to get their act together and stop making excuses. They have already lost valued customers including myself. From now on I will take my automotive needs elsewhere. Every other car care center has been open during this pandemic, there is no reason Walmart should be any different.",0,1
Walmart,How is it that everytime I go here,How is it that everytime I go here. They are always out of sanitizing product for the carts and your hands. That is their job to provide sanitizing product to help protect everyone. They are more concerned on counting people in and out than sanitizing. Don't order online. In 2 months I have ordered 9 items and 9 times its been the wrong item. I'm tired of waiting my time to take it to the store to have them return it for me. Customer service quality is bad.

Walmart,Hours,What is with closing at 8:30 on Saturday in the middle of summer? All other stores are close to being being back to normal hours. I get you need to clean more.

Walmart,Never shop Walmart online they offer NO SUPPORT.,"The third party seller was still messing around with my return request and offering no resolution to the issue. I finally gave up trying to get my money back from them and opened the journal package. As soon as I opened the journal the spine separated from the pages making the journal useless. I have asked for a full refund on the journal which included a shipping charge since it's defective so we'll see how they respond to my request for a refund. I don't have high hopes that they will do the right thing though. Never shop Walmart online. They use third party sellers and if you don't like the product(s) they offer NO SUPPORT. I have a Better Business and Consumer complaint filed against them for failing to support me as a customer. I ordered a couple items that were no where near what was described and took a lot longer to arrive so wanted to return them. The third party seller was pretty much useless and honestly very insulting. They refused to allow me return and offered a whopping $2 refund instead (after charging me $5 to get the items shipped). When I reached out to Walmart all they said was deal with the third party seller, nice huh? Save your money and frustration level and shop with companies that protect their customers.",0,1

Bad quality ! Fake reviews!!!",0,1

It never showed up so I called Walmart so they could cancel the order and resend another one. I was promised and patronized By the representative who said multiple times please tell your daughter happy birthday she could care less what this woman thinks she wants her present. Here we are June 5 and it still has not been delivered the representative promised me it would come no later than June 3 because she was going to ship it two day delivery yet when I checked the tracking it was being shipped FedEx ground.

Then I asked for them to send the missing device. No Action. So then I file a complaint with the BBB and then they start responding but haven’t yet to refund my money nor picked the chair up. I called again about picking up chair and refund my money. No Action. Then they wanted to offer me $30 then $150 and I paid $381.00. So I file a fraud complaint with my bank. I will never order another anything from them never again. At this point I don’t want to shop there. I rather shop at Dollar General, Family Dollar or the Dollar Store from now on.

Walmart,No refund for a damaged dehumidifier received.,"I ordered a Costway Dehumidifier thru Walmart.com and the product arrived at my house damaged. I repacked the product and returned it to my local Walmart and they advised me they could not accept it for a refund, but advised I had to contact Costway, the vendor who sold the item, and get a refund from them. I contacted Costway and they first asked for photos of the damage. I sent photos then they advised they would refund me $40 and I could just use the dehumidifier as it is (damaged). I advised them that would not work so then they contacted me and stated they would refund me $150 and I could take the dehumidifier to somewhere local to get it repaired. I advised them I was not going to negotiate with them and I wanted a full refund. Now communications from their end have ceased so I called Walmart Customer Service and was placed on hold for 20 minutes. Then I spoke to a customer service rep for a few short moments and he advised me he needed to transfer my call to another department. I was then placed on hold for another 20 minutes and then the call went dead. I will now be working thru my credit card company to rectify this matter.An update to my review: I received an email from Costway stating that they have decided to issue a full refund to me for the damaged product if it was acceptable to me.

I feared the worse, and after 2 weeks UPS has stated that they dont seem to have ever gotten the package from AntOnline to ship.It is absolutely Walmarts responsibility to make sure that the suppliers that are selling on their site are reputable. Now I have to go through a massive hassle of getting a refund, and then figure out how to get a refund for the Walmart warranty that I ordered along with the Xbox. Horrible, horrible experience.

But if you buy wrong size they refuse return. They also refuse return on wrong size shoes. Covid19 doesn't stay on items such as clothing or shoes forever. According to latest research from infectious control on study published in the NEJM, it shows it lasts less than 24 hours.So put the returns in a bin and don't put back on shelves for 4 days.

Walmart,System update is a problem,"Now Walmart forced people to pay in advance before you can check out to reserve a time. The problem with that is for one...by time associates start to gather your order there is always something that Walmart ends up not having. The other issue is that the associates often get the wrong items. They want to enforce no contact and to just open your trunk, but when you get home and put your stuff away and notice the mistakes they made, you’re expected to go in store to return or exchange. Completely kills the purpose of curbside pick up. No compensation for an associates wrong doing. I really dislike this update with HAVING to paying before you go to pick up.",0,3

Walmart,Horrible Costumer Service,"I ordered a pool from Walmart last week for in-store pickup to be picked up by the end of store hours on Monday, June 1. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I could not get to the store before Monday to pick up the item. Prior to going to the store on Monday, I called numerous times that afternoon to make sure they were open and let them know I was coming to pick it up, but kept getting a message that their associates were all busy. My husband drove, half an hour each way, to pick up the pool only to find out that the store had closed early due to the protests going on in the neighborhood. My husband tried to get someone to help him out (or at least answer his questions) since there were numerous employees both inside and outside of the store, but they all refused to even listen to him. I chatted with a Walmart representative via online-chat yesterday and was assured that the store would hold onto the item for me for at least seven more days. Lo-and-behold, this morning, I get an email that my order has been cancelled and the money has been refunded. I have no interest in a refund since I cannot buy the pool anywhere now for less than $100 (I paid $25) and really need the pool for my kids. I tried to call the store this morning but again kept on getting a message saying that all representatives were busy, leading me to believe that they were closed. I called Walmart.com and was told that there was nothing they could do for me. I asked them to have a supervisor call me back to discuss this further and got a call from the supervisor about thirty minutes ago. That supervisor than proceeded to BLAME ME for waiting until the last day to pick up my item. He has told me that Walmart.com has NO WAY to reach out to the store to ask them to hold onto the item for me. He has suggested that I drive to Walmart again and again to look if they have posted a sign and see if they are open. When I again said that I didn't understand how they could have no way to reach out to the store, he said he would try them. When he called, he somehow got through and I found out that the store is open today and had put my item back on the shelf. He had me speak to the representative at the store who told me that if I wanted to know if the item is on the shelf I should drive back to the store and check for myself - half an hour each way. When I asked her to have an employee check for me, she said that wasn't possible. Then, magically, when I spoke to her supervisor thirty seconds later, she tells me they did check and it's not on the shelf. She proceeds to tell me that she cannot do anything for me - not for my lost time or item, not for the fact that you cannot buy this pool anywhere now for less than $100, not for all the headache this has caused... This is completely unacceptable and no one is taking any responsibility for their mistake!",0,1

So, I explain to her that I either needed my food to feed my kids or I needed my money to feed my kids. She placed me on another long hold and then got back on and said she still could not do anything for me. I then read the email that she just sent to me while we were on the phone and it said I would get a refund for $0.00. She said no, that's not what it says. I read the email out loud to her and she was quit and then said, I don't know what that is. Once we hung up, I immediately received another email saying, ""As per MY request, We (Walmart) are cancelling my order. "" I never cancelled my order! You lost my order!

I could get the 2 I needed for what Walmart was charging for 1. I go on and try to cancel the one item and it was like looking for a needle in a haystack to find the cancel this item button. I tried taking to customer service through chat about it. I had to wait an HOUR. Once I was on I spoke to the lady and half way through she takes about 5 min to answer so I walk in the next room and back only about a min and she disconnected our chat. I've never had this much difficulty anywhere else. It's a quick ok we'll cancel that and done immediately especially when it was right after I placed the order. I had to get on chat again this morning. So I put in every bit of information (order #, email, exactly what the item is, etc.) And she kept asking me what is the tracking number ,what is the item. It literally tells you to give the information before they connect you. Why do this if the representative is not going to read it? Really annoyed with the whole situation.

Instead of fixing the problem and sending the product once the system is efficient, the order was just cancelled.

Walmart,This company is a scam,Avoid using Walmart at all costs. Their return policy is how they are making up for loss from covid-19. They are not doing exchanges or returns until the unforeseeable future. So they will hold onto your money and build the interest in their accounts for the next 3 to 6 months. Holding the money of millions of customers that are already struggling just to make more profit is downright scumbag and dirty of Walmart. They are knowingly selling defective food products and Walmart is not willing to correct the issue in any way.,0,1

Product has not arrived and countless emails have gone unanswered and what is worse Walmart customer service reps were ignorant and uninformed.

The package she was referring to was still at customs in Vancouver and she would have not known that at that time.In short, Walmart has hired lying buffoons to help their loyal customers.

Walmart,BOYCOTTING WALMART,"In the midst of COVID Walmart had this cycle for $98.99. I called & after being put on hold for 47 minutes they said it was on clearance & ""out of stock"". It wasn't returning therefore, I couldn't be put on backorder lists. They adviced to try my local stores. I spent a long weekend calling & going to all my local stores in a 40 mile radius. Zilch! Nothing! The VERY next day, MONDAY, a friend called saying It was BACK on their website! I said what? I went online & sure enough miracles of miracles there it is! Except now 24 HOURS later it's for $199.99! I ordered it but the more I thought on it I felt conned! I called Walmart for an explanation. They said ""it just arrived"" & that it sold online ONLY. So why was I directed to the stores? No answer. Only ""Sorry"". After all the rigamarules I went through I feel walmart yanked it off their website only to jack up the price. That as a ""3rd party"" sold this they were unable to honor the 24 hours previous price. Adding insult to injury they offered a 10% off my next order. UNBELIEVABLE! I'm refusing delivery of this & will no longer shop Walmart. (And trust me when I tell you. I shopped A LOT at walmart) I'm going back to Target & Amazon. At least they honor their prices. This kind of horrid service shall become walmarts down fall. As a loyal customer I am seriously so very disappointed in Walmart.",0,1

The same week I ordered from them - my debit card was compromised And 900.00 was taken out. I had to cancel my debit card. I had to return the duplicate items and because my debit card had been cancelled they could not return the money to my card and said because I ordered through Wal-Mart.com I could not receive a cash refund and would have to get my refund in WalmartGift cards. Additionally, half my order couldn’t be returned and I had to send it back to the 3rd party ... the 3rd party emailed me 1 time and sent me two return labels and I could only print one. They didn’t send a label for the last item. I have been trying to reach Hayneedle, the third party, for days and no response and I have only a couple more weeks before I can no longer return these items. Additionally, I will have to dispute with my bank to try and get a response. This is absolutely unacceptable for a mistake Wal-Mart.com made.

Here it is Thursday May 28, 2020, and still they will not take my return. They are blaming it on the virus. The customer service area has protective shields in place, the employees have face masks on, there are social distancing markers on the floor. There are no customers in line. The employees have nothing to do. This is $84.00 of my Stimulus money being held hostage. The longer they hold on to it, the more interest it acrues for them. I have contacted the Louisiana state Attorney General's office. I demand something be done about this. Walmart should have roped off the clothing area if they knew that they were not going to be accepting returns. Now I can't get the correct sizes, I have nothing to wear. Target is not doing this to it's customers. Target will be getting my business from now on. Very unhappy, very unsatisfied. You lost a loyal customer.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart USED to be like Disney-Happiness Place on Earth for me lol,"I think back 10 years or more and Walmart was the place to go, what felt like the best place in the world. I wanted to be there literally everyday! Fast forward to today and I DESPISE going there. It is never an enjoyable experience and honestly for me it has been because of the employees. I live in LA, and I have been to multiple Walmarts and the experience has been the same-no one greets you, they are huddling around talking about personal stories ex.- ""how they didn't get a stimulus check because someone owed taxes,"" complaining about benefits, how much they are paid, hours, ect. I understand if you are unhappy, but if you are choosing to stay then you should be professional and not have discussions like that around customers. I have asked for help and someone just shakes their head no, and the last straw for me was being in Walmart and asking for something from the case-I asked 2 employees that were working in that area ""I don't have the key,"" ok so who has the key? ""Manager up at customer service""-ok, can you go ask for me to get in the case? ""Oh, I would have to walk all the way up there and back because I don't have a radio.!"" WAIT, WHAT! Now come on man, and to beat it all I went to customer service and then the manager tells me to go back and ask the pharmacy because they have the key. I was appalled and honestly I have been dealing with that kind of environment long enough and that was the last straw. I would rather pay more money and go to a classier store where you are treated with respect, people are friendly, employees aren't miserable and displaying it to customers AFTER I have even heard them in the huddle meetings yelling ""Walmart, Walmart, Walmart."" Don't be fake Walmart. I know I am only one person, but I am 100% certain that others have experienced the same situations and they are tired of it to.",0,1

Walmart,Avoid At All Costs.....You Will Regret Shopping On Walmart.com!!!,"So Walmart.com decided to deactivate my account and told me I violated their policies concerning returns. They have some nerve. I had previously told them that I would not be placing anymore online orders anyway because I am tired of getting scammed and being sent counterfeit products or products that are damaged or spoiled. I have had NUMEROUS problems with placing orders on Walmart.com. Most times I do not get my order, the order shows up days or weeks late, it's damaged, or I am being sent a fake product. Over the last few weeks since COVID-19, I have had to deal with incorrect orders, money being taken from my account unauthorized, damaged smelly products, and the list goes on and on and on. I have complained several times about scam sellers and Walmart does nothing but blame me and think I am wrong, which couldn't be further from the truth. One Walmart.com seller even sent me two shoes of different sizes where someone wrote over the size 9 and put the number 7!!!. Unbelievable!!! I wear a size 7 in shoes, so how in the holy hell did they think I could wear a size 9 flat shoe and the other shoe being a size 7?! The f&*k??? Actually, this is a relief. I have had issues with Walmart for years when it came to placing online orders for store pickup or delivery. Walmart.com is a complete scam full of criminals, and when you complain, they do nothing and their nasty attitude miserable employees don't give a royal f$%k! I hope to not even have to shop in their stores, but that is sometimes hard to do because they often have lower prices than other local stores. So I can breathe easier now and just spend my money online elsewhere from more reliable retailers. To be honest, most major retailers are problematic at some point, but I have found that Walmart and Amazon are the absolute worst. And most, if not all, retailers seem to give customers a hard time when it comes to returning items and wanting a refund. I do not want to shop with any store that tries to control me; I'm not anyone's inmate. If I have a legitimate concern, then I have a right to complain or request a refund however many times I want. That's why when I hear about Walmart or Amazon being scammed by customers, I rejoice because they deserve it. No one with active brain cells likes Walmart, people only shop there because it is cheaper when you live on a budget. So f%$k you Walmart, I do NOT need anymore stress and I'm much happier not having to deal with Walmart.com!!! Goodbye!",0,1

They will NOT allow returns on any clothing until they say ""maybe sometime in June"". So keep it/store it until then and maybe they will take it back. But they have a 30 day return policy? They say that the signs are posted. Yeah right, little index cards with small print in obscure places and they have a current sale on clothing now to boot. As far as I'm concerned, the clothing can sit on the racks and rot because I will not purchase from Wally world ever again. Their whole attitude about it made me see red. At least when they sell fireworks, they post HUGE signs that say no returns. Why not about NOT returning clothing? Because it's a straight up rip off. Other stores are allowing returns on clothing and I will stick with them moving forward.",0,1

Walmart,This is a formal complaint,"This is a formal complaint Yesterday, I visited the Dallas Ga healthcare center yesterday for a scheduled dental appointment at 10am. There were 3 people with appointments including me. They asked each of us the same questions: have you been tested for covid19 and do you have a fever. The Caucasian female and make answered no to covid19 test and I said I had been tested and it was negative. Then all three of us said we didn’t have a fever.They proceeded to take them back to the dentist however continued to question me. They asked why did I get the test and I said because it was recommended that we all recommended to get tested by healthcare workers and by our elected officials. Then they took my temperature and said it was 99.1 and they refused to treat me although I was in excruciating pain and needed dental care. I insisted they take the temperature again and they took it under the arm and it was 98.1. They still said I had a fever so wouldn’t treat me. Then she asked if I had drank coffee and I said yes. I also drove a convertible so of course I was warm. They recommended I come back July 11 when fever is gone. I pleaded with them to let me see the dentist and they said No.In pain and upset and confused I drive directly to the Peachtree urgent care in Lithonia and my vitals were taken and the temperature was 95.5. They said I needed an oral surgeon immediately to correct the problem and made a referral.For the record either this behavior is medical incompetence or pure 21st century racism. First temperatures 98 and 99 it is not considered clinical fevers by basic healthcare standards and number two the real temperature did not warrant me being denied healthcare especially when I drove 51 miles because the treatment cost at that facility was economically.I will never refer anyone here because they have clearly shown their patient biases towards people of color. Second I will be asking for an internal review of all their patient procedures to ensure fairness is given to all in regards to treatment. It was humiliating and embarrassing and it cost me 122 miles on my car and it was wasted time and to add I was in extreme pain. Was told to come back July 11",0,1
Walmart,I'm a longtime customer,"I'm a longtime customer, and supposedly walmart says they want customers happy with their purchase, and guaranteed return if not satisfied. Well I put a layaway in March 3, 2020, it was a ring. I took layaway out May 5, 2020 for my mom birthday May 6, 2020. Never did they tell me that no return will be made due to coronavirus. Well my mom decide to return, to purchase something else, but even with receipt they said no. I don't understand if returns were not allowed then they should not sell the item, or notify customers that no return would be allowed. This looks like they only want to make business, and don't care about customers rights. Who wants this, this is not fair at all. If because of coronavirus then they shouldn't be selling anything that is not returnable. Then you call customers service and they have an attitude. We as customers have the right to return anything with receipt if not satisfied. Looks like Walmart is only interested in selling and making money.",0,1

Walmart,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered a bike on May 4, 2020 with a delivery date of May, 26, 2020. Today I checked on it and in my computer it was never shipped. Next step called Walmart customer service and spoke to Gary who informed me the item it out of stock and they have no idea when it may arrive. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold. Aprox.ten minutes later Gary picks up the phone and said the supervisor Bernadette could not speak to me because of equipment issues and the call could not be transferred. Gary further stated he communicated with her and she had my phone number and when asked why she just didn’t call me the reply was silence. Gary then said his supervisor told him to transfer me to the escalation department. Again I go on hold. After waiting Kenisha picks up the phone, listens to all that has taking place and offers to cancel the order. I never asked her to cancel the order but she told me that since I mentioned that Walmart had my money with no product she would do that. I informed her if that is what I wanted I could of done that forty minutes ago in stead of waiting on hold. I did ask her why I wasn’t notified of what had taken place and her response or better yet Walmart’s response was due to the pandemic the IT department is too busy to notify customers that they will not be getting their orders. I told her that the bike was available ten days ago in a store fifteen minutes from my house and if I had been updated I could have purchased the bike at a store and cancelled my order.My question is how many millions of dollars is Walmart holding onto that belong to customers and they feel it is not necessary to notify customers they wont be getting their items?",0,1

I made a complaint to Walmart Corp. but all I received back was to take a two question survey which had nothing to do with my complaint, remade complaint and have heard nothing back (4 days).

Walmart,Hello,"Hello! Yesterday I was shopping at the store in Ellicott City, MD. I payed at self checkout. The employee who was working there even didn't wait for me to finish with putting my purchases in the cart and started to clean and wipe the cash register very close to me, not keeping 6 foot distance. At the same time she did'n do the same after the customer before me at the same cash register .And she didn't clean the register across me when a customer was leaving at the same time as me. It looks like the employee was concerned only about that cash register which I was using. Maybe to show me how much am I suspicious.I think that we have to respect each others space especially at this time.",0,3

There was a manager near by and the young lady asked the manager Christina about the process and the manager stated to me ""We don't take Sams payments here"". I informed Christina that I have always paid my bill there. Christina threw her hands up very disrespectful and rudely and said go to the pay center. I then asked for a manager she got rude and said I am the only manager here, but didn't tell the truth. I call a cousin that works at that Walmart and asked if there is a supervisor on site and yes there was another supervisor on site.

They turn around slowly like they wanna punch you in the face for doing the job they get paid for. Crazy!

Walmart is too big a deal on our very lives, I feel they are bent on not ever returning back to normal again. Thank goodness for competition we can go elsewhere for food and clothing and other necessities which will help our businesses immensely to finally get their rightful place again since Walmart took over years ago and nearly wiped them out heartlessly by selling cheaper products mainly from China and didn't mind damaging smaller businesses across this country, they are still presently the largest importer of China goods.

We had a cart full which we walked around for an hr to purchase after getting off work. A young man by the name of Frank was staring at us in the self check out while my daughter was scanning our purchases. He proceeded towards her due to a couple of wine coolers I was purchasing in the cart. He said are you purchasing those she said no they are my mom’s he said if you scan them you can’t purchase them she said ok and moved out of my way to allow me to scan them. He comes over after I was done and stated that we can’t purchase those now. I stated she didn’t scan them I did he said she was scanning the groceries but she stopped when it got to the wine coolers he said to me as though I was a child I said you can’t purchase those. Then a security guard who wouldn’t give me his name came over and acted as though we were stealing and stood there. I told them I am not purchasing any of these items a manager came over and stated to me have a nice day without asking anything a short white man with classes who wouldn’t allow me see his name and didn’t introduce himself. I have never been so humiliated in my life and I will take a long drive to shop for other items and spend a little more not to be treated like that ever.

I used the Walmart website for the first time to order a printer, it was shipped by a third party. I truly had no issues with the process. However, more recently, I ordered an appliance. Over the span of 3 weeks I have not been able to reach the company, and it appears that Walmart has not been able to do so either. The number they list for this seller ""has a voicemail that has not been set up."" I am very disappointed with the ""hands off"" approach Walmart seems to be taking with this. If you are going to sell products from a third party via your website you would think they'd want to hold them to a higher standard, or at least facilitate cancelling your order in cases where it appears the item will truly not ship.",0,2

On 01 May 2020 I received shipping confirmation from Fremont CA with tracking number that it had shipped. It is now 16 May 2020 and I have not received it and the order delivery has not been updated. I sent a message to Walmart help line on 13 May and 15 May, each time Walmart robot responded email with a US AMPRIME Technology would respond within one business day and the US AMPRIME Technology has not responded. I blame Walmart on this as Walmart is who I placed this order with, they do not respond to me other than ROBO emails. Walmart's policy is once an item ships the order cannot be canceled. So technically my order has shipped even though it apparently only moved once on May 1st and never again since, Checking reviews online for US AMPRIME Technology finds a pattern of similar complaints, orders reported shipped to one location then not moving again. Again I ordered form Walmart, that was the website and reviews I read for the product, At this point I consider my money stolen by an online scheme that one of the worlds biggest companies is part of.

I guess the website on the phone duplicated the shipping address as my billing and even though my credit card okay'd it Walmart didn't. Okay, your web site on the iphone sucks. Let's move to the computer.Second time, used the computer, ensured the delivery and billing addresses were correct, submitted it, 5 minutes later same Walmart has canceled your order email. Lets try calling them to fix the order.Called the company, went for the call back 1 hour 45 minutes later (I get it, it's busy right now with everything going on). Got the call back, guy I talked to was nice but he couldn't help, said it was because I did not use that specific credit card at Walmart.com before... Escalated it to someone else who said they overrode the system and I had to order it again after 30 minutes and within an hour and it will absolutely go through.40 minutes later....Third time is a charm right...no way, submitted the order, correct addresses everything, 5 minutes later, Walmart has canceled my order. Needless to say, I am all set. If they couldn't get it right after 3 tries I am moving on. Target was no problem and price matched it - Done with Walmart Online and BUYER BEWARE.

Walmart,Walmart.com charges sales tax on clothing in NJ illegally.,"bought clothing from you online (I live in NJ)and there was sales tax charged. There is no sales tax on clothing in NJ. I figured this was an error and would be fixed when it shipped. When I shop online in any other site, Target, Etsy, eBay, I am ONLY charged sales tax on items that are taxed in NJ. It's not determined by where the item is SENT FROM, as many come from across seas where they have NO TAX...yet I am rightfully charged if it is a taxable item in NJ at NJ's tax rate. My request for a refund was denied as Walmart claims it can charge tax based on the merchant's state, not the point of sale. NO OTHER ONLINE SITE DOES THIS!Here is the review I am posting on every social media site I can and will be contacting the BBB and news media. People have a right to know how Walmart is basically stealing from people, and especially in these times, that is beyond reprehensible.BEWARE! When you buy clothing from here, Walmart charges you sales tax, even if your state doesn't tax clothing. They CLAIM it's because it is being shipped from a state that does have it! With people being as hard hit as we are now, this is another truly *** greedy robber baron move on the part of Walmart. When I buy clothes from ANY OTHER place I am not charged, as my state NJ, doesn't tax therm. The tax is to be collected at the POINT OF SALE and the state tax where it is being SHIPPED , not where it's shipped to. Please share this so people know what dirtbags this company is!I filed a dispute with paypal and was denied. Here is their response:I understand in New Jersey there is no sales tax on clothes. When you purchase online you may not be purchasing within the state of New Jersey. You have to pay whatever fees are associated with purchasing wherever the merchant may be located.PayPal would not be able to fight the legality of this dispute and that is why we denied the claim. You would need to take legal action to pursue this further.Please feel free to share this on any social media you use, I know I am!User's recommendation: DO NOT BUY CLOTHING HERE!WalMart Cons: Slimy ethics, Illegal charges, No response from company to complaints.",0,1

Walmart,"Very poor manager, store disgusting, and dirty","I was looking online for some speciality fabric. The only Walmarts that had it were 15 and 30+ miles. I figured I would order it for curbside pickup. The Chantilly VA Walmart was closest and as I went to order, it wouldnt let me. I tried on different computers and my phone. So I drove there the next day and while walking from my car, I see a United Alliance man who appeared to be a securty guard, walking to the door without a mask. I figured he would put it on once the doors opened. I went ahead in and didn't see him, so I went to the fabic department. It was a total mess and dirty looking. I did not see the fabric, rechecked on my phone where it was listed as in stock. I found an employee who said there is no one there, I showed her my phone, and she stated the associates do not know what is ordered or advertised. I just left and noticed one employee stacking produce boxes WITHOUT MASK, another straightening makeup WITHOUT MASK, another 2 were spotted with masks on their neck, as I approached the exit door here come 2 more employees, one with and one WITHOUT MASK, I stopped them and asked the women if she was indeed a Walmart Employee (had on the vest) she said yes, could she help me. I said yes, you need to wear your mask. She made a snarky comment about I have one, I said well please put it on. Then I went to Customer Service to talk hopefully to store mananger, waited 5 minutes because no one was there. Then I stepped in the doorway to the back room, a young employee was bringing out a cart and DID have on mask. I explained there were several Walmart employees without them on and the manager needed to speak to them. She said she would pass it along. I was disgusted and just left the store. There were also long lines of people, close together, no one mentioning anything, so annuncements. This store is disgusting and does not abide by its rules, nor honestly advertises.",0,1

When I asked for information at a closed by Walmart shop, the shop assistent laughed and said that delivery errors happens very often.

I checked on the status of my order today and, although it still says the grad announcements would be delivered tomorrow, I noticed that the order said in process with no tracking number. So, I called Walmart.com. The lady told me the order was stuck and I would have to cancel the order and reorder. Are you kidding? She also yelled at me and told me to ""stop yelling at her"" (I admit my voice was a little heated from frustration, but I wasn't yelling). I asked to talk to a manager and when she finally got on she told me ""it happens sometimes, and they would refund my money"". A lot of good that does me as it's now mid May and I have no graduation announcements. Luckily I was able to order from Walgreens (another 3 hours of designing invites) and can pick them up tomorrow. WORST lack of service EVER. No compassion at all and only a matter of fact ""it happens sometimes"". Goes to show large corporations could care less.

Walmart,Ordered a product on Walmart online,"Ordered a product on Walmart online. It was from a 3rd party seller.

After another week, same thing, and I put an email to the seller (via walmart.com) to cancel the order and issue a full refund. Walmart's online veribiage said I should hear from the seller in about 24 hours. Now, it's 3 weeks later and I haven't heard anything. So, the ONLY way to contact Walmart to help resolve the issue (cancel the order and process a refund) is either by phone or chat, both of which had about a 3 hour wait time. I decided to do the phone and waited 3 hours. Then, after 3 hours, Walmart's customer rep (customer resolutions) said the only thing they can do is send an email to the seller, wait another 24 hours for a reply, and then I would need to call back AGAIN (wait another 3 hours) in order for Walmart to process a refund. Ridiculous/!! Why can't Walmart at least handle some of these issues by email? I shouldn't have to wait 6 hours to process a simple refund.

I have never had someone just hang up on me so so called back and she told me YOU HAVE TO CALL AGAIN, which was 3 times already and Money gram saw no issues so money gram asked if rep could just call to see what error message they were getting, PAM refused said she don’t need to be calling anyone and for me to call again (4 times) and my sister HAD to go back after 3 times. Needless to say my sister will NEVER go back to the store again I was told she could go to CVS by the rep on the phone. I have used this service before without any issues. I wish you had CUSTOMER SERVICE without all the attitude, I wasn’t asking her for anything other that what the issue was but she raised her voice at us both and had the worst attitude.

As a customer service representative, I know how to treat a customer or just humans in general and I don’t appreciate someone raising their voice at me or giving me such nasty attitude, I never complain about anything but this was definitely a horrible experience for the both of us, spending the whole day (Mother’s Day) dealing with such drama.

I had already started scanning my items when they approached me. I was with another person and we had two separate orders, we just used the same cart. The cashier should have inquired about that instead of getting an attitude with us. I told them that was fine and took items out that went over 20 and told them they could be returned to the shelf. It wasn't my loss, just the stores. I told them that. One of the employees said ""no it's not our loss."" I had a face mask on due to COVID-19. The female employee said I called her a name, which never happened. I won't be back. Hopefully they will train their employees better. 3 employees approaching a customer and surrounding him for having 10 more items through self checkout is a bit extreme.

My credit card information on the site has the present address on it, and there’s NO PLACE on the app that shows address, change of address, ANYTHING that would give a person a clue that there’s a problem with the address. In horror,I called the ‘service’ number and waited well over 2 hours for a human to come on. He told me to go to my desktop and find a change of address there, which I did. WHY IS THIS NOT ON THE PHONE APP???!? I immediately cancelled the last item, as I know longer trust Walmart’s total incompetence. This happened last week. This morning I received an email telling me the last item—the one I cancelled last week—has been sent to MY OLD ADDRESS!!! I am in TEARS OF RAGE over this.

But the order has never arrived after two months. I called the customer service helpline, my phone was disconnected every single time after a long hold. I left my phone number for a call back, but nobody ever called me back. I emailed the customer service, they told me the following: the item is sold by a Third Party Seller and not by Walmart Canada. Please contact the Seller directly for all matters relating to your order. They sounded like they has nothing to do with my order and asked you to deal with the third party seller yourself. But the receipt and order details were all sent by Walmart. I have since emailed four times the Walmart Customers Service and five times to the third party sellers, but no refund was issued.The third party seller replied and provided the following answer: many our customers have encountered this situation. The tracking information stays on Mar 18, but in fact, many customers had received but have not updated the information on net.I have never received an email from Walmart to pick up my order. The third party seller didn't know whether i had received the order or not. Walmart didn't communicate with the third party as to whether the customers have picked up the order. This is ridiculous. Had I known that the products were sold by a third party and Walmart didn't even know whether the products's quality is up to par and when there were issues, they just ignore you, i wouldn't have ordered anything from Walmart website. This is a scam and please don't order anything from Walmart as there is no quality control and no after sale service, they want you to deal with a third party seller who you don't even know where the seller is.No property warnings were given before you pay for the products on check out.

I was given a ship date of May 1st by 6pm (Friday). On this day I placed a call to the online store because I was tracking this item, and it was showing me the item was in Texas. Well I live in Atlanta GA. When I placed the call to the online store the rep informed me that I may still get the item Intime. I did not but I did get it the following business day. (Monday) I was excited about this and couldn't wait to put this together and see he finish product. Now this was a bookshelf that weights 155lbs. After I fully assembled the item, I ran into an issue with the hardware door. I was not able to put the door on (Yes it has doors on this bookshelf). The very next day I called to Walmart.com and explained my issue. I was informed this item was from Better Holmes and Gardens, and I should call them they will correct this. Well this was never corrected walmart.com is asking me to return the item. I explained this weights 155lbs and its fully assembled with a nonfunctional door. I'm really disturbed about how this is handled. I've explained to Walmart.com that I as the customer did everything correct. I followed all the rules. I paid the full retail price of this item, and I’m getting the short end of the stick on this. I'm still working with them, But my advice to Walmart.com. Please investigate this and the return policy. Customers beware that if you buy a large item, and you find it to be defective. That my experience with the online store was not good.

Tried their HELP CENTER still no answer. Tried emailing them and still no answer. I don't think they will still send those missing items on my order. Because it says on my order status that all items are delivered. This is such a big company but yet they cannot commit of giving good service. With all the reviews I have read about all their bad experience with walmart online service I think people need to stop patronizing WALMART.

Walmart,Packages never arrive!!,"Twice now (within a couple weeks of each other) I have had items not shipped. The first order was for a trampoline for my son's birthday. Initially got an email that said it would be delayed, then next day got an email that said it had shipped. The posted delivery day came and went. I contacted customer service (had to wait over an hour to speak to someone) and she supposedly contacted FedEx who said the package would be delivered the next week. Fast forward a week and still no package. I contacted customer service again (another over an hour wait) and this time I was informed the package was lost in transit. How the hell do you lose a huge 250+ pound trampoline?? Next package was a smoker. Again get an email/status update package has shipped with a delivery date. What concerned me was the FedEx tracking site only showed ""label created"" and no actual transit of the package. Again hour wait to talk with someone. Well well well....another package lost in transit. Either FedEx has some super shady thieves or Walmart is selling stuff they don't actually have in stock and using ""lost in transit"" as an excuse.

On Wednesday (the third day) I checked the tracking of my order and it stated that it was delivered at 11:12 am. I went to the store around 5 pm, which was six hours after delivery and should had been plenty of time for them to have the order ready. After the associate looked inside the bins and calling another about my order, I was told that the order was not ready and that I would get a notification once it was. It as now been close to 24 hours since this item (an Apple Watch) as been delivered by FedEx to the store and I have yet to receive the notification.This is the first time I order Walmart online and it will be my last.

I then tried to get a hold of someone at customer service at Walmart and had to wait for over 2 hours for a person, gave up that day and tried again the next, had a person call and said the vendor would be getting in touch for either a refund or to reship the items, never heard from them. Contacted them again and had to wait 2 hours for a call back, was told that she was processing the refund but still nothing in my account after over a week, contacted them yesterday this time by their messenger and this time I had so wait in front of my computer for over an hour, thankfully the person that helped me this time actually did process the refund and it's in my account now. I have never had such aggravation dealing with a customer service center or issue with an item that was supposed to be delivered but never was. Unfortunately these 3rd party vendors that Walmart uses have no oversight by Walmart for their lousy service and Walmart is going to take the fall for this. This was supposed to be a service comparable to Amazon and it's not even in the same league as Amazon. After this I will not be ordering from any Walmart vendor and will only order if it's fulfilled by Walmart and even then I will check with Amazon first to see if it's carried there, even if it's more expensive at Amazon I will use them before ever using Walmart again.Also there is no reason why I should have to speak to someone in another country and have to wait 2 hours to resolve any issue with an order placed through Walmart.",0,1

I know you are probably thinking ""it's not Walmart's fault"", but I beg to differ...if Walmart had higher standards and cared about their customers, they wouldn't choose little, no name companies who clearly can't keep up with the demand of Walmart's large number of customers. In fact, knowing the company's practices, they probably select these little companies intentionally so that they will get the negative review, Walmart can go on it's happy way, and the little company implodes amongst all the negative feedback.

Walmart,Worst Customer Service,"I have been trying to contact the Bridgeview Walmart Pharmacy, store 1779 for about 30 minutes now. I have called the pharmacy at least 10 times and let the phone ring until it hung up on me. No one has answered. I called the general store number and once they patched me through to pharmacy and again, no one answered. I called again and a woman answered that she would see what she could do about connecting me to the pharmacy and then proceeded to hang up on me. I called the general number again, and another woman proceeded to tell me that everyone in the pharmacy is on lunch and to call back later. Forgive me for not knowing the policies of Walmart but I think it a little ridiculous that every single person in the entire pharmacy would be out on break at the same time. I am trying to get ahold of someone so I can renew a blood pressure medication. I am out of this medication and I need it today. I am an 84 year old woman with hypertension and other pre-existing conditions. With COVID going on, I can not make unnecessary trips to the store to see what is going on with my prescription. I need to speak to someone on the phone so I can renew this prescription and then send my granddaughter to pick it up. In the time that it took me to find this website and write this paragraph out I was on hold for 7 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager was not in. I am currently on hold waiting to speak to whoever can help connect me to a pharmacist. This is absolutely ridiculous that I have to be dealing with this right now. This is the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire time of coming to Walmart. Don't waste your time dealing with these incompetent people; go to CVS or Walgreens.",0,1

Mancro took my money and didn't send the masks. Contacted Walmart about a refund. All they did was contacted the thief. And told that 1 of their employees will contact me in 1 day. Never heard from them. Lost $30. This seller have been scamming many people.,0,1
Walmart,Worst experience and worst service ever.,"I shopped around for a golf cart - Amazon, D's Sporting Goods, Walmart, etc. Walmart promised delivery in one week so I purchased it from them. It was a bait and switch. After placing my order I was informed that the shipment would be delayed. After waiting 2 weeks I requested to cancel the order. The order still shows cancellation pending after an additional 2 weeks, so I tried contacting them. Their online chat service is worthless. I entered detailed information in the chat box while waiting 40 minutes for an agent. Apparently the agent never sees it or doesn't read it because he closed the chat when I left - I could not wait 40 minutes but I gave all the information before I left - to no avail. Apparently, the only way to cancel an order is to delete your credit card information so they are forced to cancel the order themselves. Walmart should be concerned about losing customers like me.",0,1

Walmart,Refund / Exchange Issues,"Refund / Exchange IssuesProblem: On April 9, 2020, I purchased a freezer and extended warranty on Walmart.com. The transaction went through and a pre authorzation of $333.77 went against my debit card. Received an email from Walmart.com on April 12 saying my freezer would arrive by end of day on April 28 because it was shipped out that day. On 4/15/20 the amount of $333.77 was debited against my bank account. The promised date of delivery was set for no later than April 28. I was ok with that because due to meat shortages we had prepurchased a $800 side of beef scheduled to be delivered on Sat. May 2. I made sure that I was home on April 28 all day. I called the manufacturer (Torch Trainers) 3 times that day. No answers, no returned calls. Of course the freezer never came. I called and talked to a Lucas on the night of April 28 at 800-Walmart who assured me over and over that they would contact Torch Trainers by email and if I didn't get a response within 24 hours I would get a refund for the full amount. 24 hours had past now. Actually, 4 days has past and Walmart gave me the $34 for the protection plan that I purchased but that is all. I then had to go out and repurchase an $800 freezer to put my $800 worth of beef in because I didn't now have the luxury of taking time to find a more reasonably priced freezer to put my meat in. I thought I could trust Walmart.com but I will NEVER order from them and people need to know before purchasing that they may not get their purchases and not get their money back. ( I also waited on hold to talk to someone at Walmart.com on April 28 it was a wait time of one hour and fourty five minutes, I took a screenshot. And today, May 2, it was another hour and fifteen minutes.",0,1

I decided to give Wally world another shot and ordered for my daughter the tool and parts to be able to repair them myself. You'll never guess... Yup Walmart fu€ked up again.

A company of this size should have better customer service. I will be disputing the charge on my credit card until Walmart makes this right or I am refunded by my credit card company.

Walmart,Walmart Disposable Facemasks,"On April 16, 2020 I placed an order for disposable facemasks and received notice they would be shipped from the vendor (Mancro) and arrive on April 23. On April 26, 2020, I checked shipping date and it said the order was delayed. I checked again in a couple of delays and it said order was delayed again ""lost in shipment"" and I would receive a refund. Walmart has not responded to my request other than to forward my complaints to the vendor who hasn't responded even after a couple of attempts to contact them. I checked on the internet and found similar complaints about Walmart and this vendor. On April 28 I contacted the credit card company to dispute the charges, that showed up the day after I placed the order. I checked the Walmart site today (5-1-20) and noticed this vendor is not even listed as a supplier anymore yet Walmart still has not acknowledged my complaint or notified me of a refund. Walmart now requires all employees to wear masks - - if they can get masks for employees how come they couldn't fill orders of paying customers? I found the disposable masks from another provider at a much lower cost and they were delivered within a few days. My suggestion, don't use Walmart for anything that you can't actually see with your own eyes.",0,1

Walmart,Horrible Customer Service,I have ordered a washer online that arrived DAMAGED. I had asked for a replacement but they ran out of stock so I had to return the item in order to get a refund. Easier said then done. I had to call in for them to finally pick up my item many times and every time you call there is a 3-4 HOUR WAIT. They say the refund will be made within 5 working days which is not completely true. It will be refunded once the item arrives back at their warehouse but that takes with picking up about 3 weeks. Once that happens you’ll get your refund supposedly within 5 working days. So I don’t have a washing machine because they delivered me one that has clearly already been shipped out damaged and my money is blocked for about 2 months in total! I have spent hours and hours on the phone without any result. Even the supervisor couldn’t help or even tried to! I am completely out of work and without income because of Covid-19. I am at home all day every day without being able to do laundry and without the money that I need right now! Be aware!,0,1
Walmart,WalMart Sucks!,"I will never ever order from Walmart.com or give Wal-mart my money ever again! Absolutely the worst service ever! I placed 4 separate orders a few days apart. I did not think anything was going to go wrong until I began to receive emails about some things in my order shipping and not others. I decided to log into my account and see what was going on. In the first order I had 4 items. Each item shipped separately. In the second one, I had 23 items. They broke those into 12 different shipping groups. The third one had 6 items and the fourth had 3. The third and fourth orders automatically had 1 item each cancelled. However, when looking at the total amount paid it still showed the same amount. Some items were showing shipping sometime in May. I received emails stating the items are delayed and that I can cancel. So I chose to cancel the items. There were over 6 items delayed. I figured it was good. Monday I noticed my bank account was charged 8 times, different amounts and none match the amounts on the orders. I called my bank who stated I should contact Wal-Mart. I tried calling 3 times. The first time the wait was 30 minutes when someone answered the call was disconnected, I called again, this time the wait was 50 minutes. Once again, they answered and quickly hung up. The third time the wait was over 1 hour. This time I tired of waiting. Then today I received another charge after I received an email from Wal-Mart stating they were refunding me money because the items were not shipped. My bank was unable to help clear the charges since they have to investigate it. My bank suggested that I contact Walmart through chat. I did that today and was on hold for 140 minutes, well longer to be honest. When someone finally answered they did not seem to be able to answer my questions. Then cut me off and closed the chat session before I was done typing. I was furious! Since I was typing the chatbox then started the chat again and now it says 3 hours several minutes to wait. I do not understand why such a large company can have the worst customer service. Worse than Amazon... Buyer Beware.. do not ever order from Wal-Mart. Worst service ever!",0,1

Walmart,Horrible,Horrible! I was at the Hudson store today and I have to say I was upset and disappointed that you could not have made an accepting to the rule. I have to shop for two households because my 83 yr old mother in law cannot shop for herself or get her medicine or drive. I had two separate orders and had paid for hers with her money and was going ahead with my own order when the clerk took my toilet paper because I already purchased one for her. I tried to explain it was for two separate households and separate payments and that my elderly mom in law cannot shop for herself but he would have none of that. I offered to show him the separate payment but NO! It really makes things very difficult and very frustrating for me and I'm sure some others when you have to make separate trips for two households. I think an exception could have been made since it was only one pkg for us and one for her.SHAME ON YOU,0,1

My total purchase came out to $176, they did a automatic pickup for the pillow and bike the next day, when it was time for me to pick up the items they texted me and told me the items weren’t ready and gave me a different time to pick them up. I was ok until I got another text telling me partial of my order was cancelled and the other half was ready for pickup 🙄🙄, you can guess which one that was (the pillow). So I drove all the way to Walmart for a pillow and since there was bikes there I bought one for my son thinking I’ll have my money back for the other one that was canceled (nope). So my expected delivery date was 25 which exactly 10days from the day it was shipped out and I figured it was ok because of the way shipping has been lately so a couple days past and I noticed they still processing the $176 on my account but when I look at the app and my purchases it said a new total of $93.03 and the bike was cancelled so I called to see why I haven’t received my refund and they told me I will once my items were shipped. Ok so the next day they were shipped out but still no refund on the bike so I figured I’d give a day because you know how banks can be, but nope I still had the pending $176 so I called again only for them to tell me I had to wait for my items be delivered... 😩😫😫. So during the call I found out that they actually split up the 93.03 and took it and still have my $176!!!

I tracked my order from Alabama, then it went to Georgia, then to Tennessee, then to Illinois, and finally made its way into Missouri about 5 days late with one of the dvds lose in the case getting scratched up while it takes a tour of the US. Meanwhile the other part of my order arrived early with a puncture hole in the dvd case. I WILL NEVER USE WALFART OR FEDEX EVER AGAIN. Also I dropped walfart when they dropped ammunition sales. I only ordered from them because PBS didn't have any of the shows my daughters like in stock. Wish it was walfart and not Sears going bankrupt. Also I have never met anyone who actually enjoyed working for these a**holes no matter what branch they worked in. They look at all their employees as replaceable garbage.

Walmart,Purposefully left on hold....,"I ordered a canopy tent and patiently waited for over a month due to the pandemic for it to be delivered (for in-store pickup). After over a month, I decided to contact them. The individual on the phone told me he would issue a refund and I could order another one. I replied that the price had increased. He suggested that I call in to have the difference refunded once my 2nd order was placed.I proceeded to order a 2nd one while he processed the refund on my first order while I was on hold. Well, this threw him for a curve and suddenly he couldn't refund the difference after all. He said he wouldn't be able to see my order for 24 hours and that I'd need to speak to a supervisor when I call back. I told him I'd like to speak to a supervisor now in that case. I'm on hold and the time-on-call is currently 45 minutes.This individual clearly just put me in purgatory because he didn't want to escalate. So, this review is for you unnamed support rep.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart won't get back to me about MY cash that I didn't receive from the cashier,I spent over 200 dollars at walmart 2 weeks ago and asked for 20 cash back. When I got home I realized it wasn't given to me. I called immediately but couldn't get through bc the phone kept ringing and I kept calling all that day. I kept calling the next day and not only did the phone keep ringing but when I finally got transferred I was put on a long hold again just to be hung up on twice. I called customer service line and they had someone reach out 4 days later just for them say the have to look at the cameras. Its been 2 weeks now I don't have MY 20 dollars or even an update.

Walmart,Me and my family went into the Woodbury…,"Me and my family went into the Woodbury MN Walmart on the 17th of April to do some shopping when we were in their Walmart me and my sister decided to go into the pet section to look for cat toys for our cat we were in the pet section looking at the cat toys for 15 to 20 minutes then out of nowhere this slightly heavy object that was sitting on their very top shelf came out of nowhere and fell off the top shelf.It almost hit my sister in the face but it hit me hard on my right shoulder and scraped me a little on my nose. Me and my sister were told to comeback into the Wood bury Walmart to tell them what happened and to fill out a form we stood up in front by the customer service desk for 15 to 20 minutes waiting for someone to come up to help us out. Finally after waiting this assistant protective manager comes up to help me and my sister she took down all of our information about the accident that took place in their Walmart during the end of getting all of our information this woman was extremely rude to me and my sister.She told us to write down a claim number so that we could give it the Walmart headquarters claims department I told her that I did not have a pen on me to take down the number this woman made a very rude noise walked over took a pen out and handed it to me I took down the claim number then she told us that everything was done on their end about this matter. I was given up no apology and offered nothing to me for what happened in their store.Then I have left numerous messages for someone at their claims department they have not returned my call I received a call yesterday for their insurance agency about what happened they acted like they didn't care and that it was legitimate about what happened to me.So basically they were saying it's okay for someone to get injured at Walmart. Then today I was on the phone for nearly two hours waiting for someone from their claims department to come on the phone so I can try to talk to them about helping me getting this matter resolved. After sitting on the phone for nearly two hours no one ever came on the phone so i finally just decided to give up and hang up. For Walmart to treat people like this is really unacceptable and there is no excuse on this earth for them to treat someone like this.Me and my family have been going to Walmart for years for all of our needs but that is going to stop as of right now because now I know that Walmart does not care about the American people and if they get hurt in their stores the only thing that Walmart gives a damn about is the all American Dollar. So I will no longer be stepping my two feet into another Walmart store again,and if people were wise they would do the same thing do your shopping elsewhere there are much better places to go shopping than Walmart.",0,1

Walmart,I have shopped walmart online for… 5 years,"I have shopped walmart online for years. With one of my first orders (years ago) an item never arrived and because it was marketplace they refused a refund. I shopped this Christmas and had problems tracking items, items not arriving and incorrect items received. It was such a hassle trying to untangle that web. I vowed I would not shop their website again. Well, I did. Just made a bigger purchase. Order was broken up (to be expected) and 1 part of the order was in prep when I could see it on Monday (4/20/20) but now I can't see anything in my purchase history. Called them to check status because I noticed that they reversed the original total and re-ran independently by shipment. They said bank account will be charged for remaining items after they pass QC but then said they were shipped and will be here 4/24/20. I'm really confused as today is the 22nd and order status is still in pending. Not looking forward to this mess. I don't enjoy working with them anymore.

Walmart,Very hit or miss with Walmart.com,"Very hit or miss with Walmart.com. Sometimes, their service is on par with Amazon. However, it appears from my experience, that they do a lot more Marketplace advertising, so many of the item ordered are fulfilled by other vendors, not Walmart.com. It is also frustrating that a lot of their 'house brand' Equate products cannot be purchased online for ship to home, which is sort of rediculous, and makes for sometime a rather cumbersome and awkward series of orders that I either have to have some parts shipped, some parts pick up in store, and other items that while shown on the website, I still have to go to the store, walk the isles and buy them brick and mortar, with no shipping or pickup options available. Very confusing and cumbersome, and they should really work to fix this. They are missing the convenience that consumers get from the likes of Amazon, where everything is available to ship, and a majority of items these days are 2 day shipping via their Prime shipping option.I try and steer clear of anything that isn't directly sold and shipped by Walmart, as their third party vendors in my opinion are very poor at fulfilling orders timely, and what an ordeal a return turns in to with third party vendors. Many items can be returned to a local store, but not everything. And NOTHING that was fulfilled by a third party vendor can be returned to a store. Again, this just makes for a very confusing process. Amazon gives you a prepaid label, you drop it off to USPS or UPS (or even a local Kohls store), and your refund is generally given within hours of the shipping company receiving it!Catch up Walmart, you're losing marketshare, and doing little to keep up!",0,3

IT Is not worth spending your money there on frivilous items you'll get stuck with when you realize you don't really need it or it broke or whatever the case may be. ZERO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OR SERVICE AT WALMART ANYMORE. I suggest you check the return policy on items at other stores and go elsewhere if you don't want to worry about getting your money back on items. They say it's temporary due to covid but I doubt it, its' probably so they can inflate their sales numbers by showing next to no returns which keeps their sales numbers up for the quarter which is at the customers expense at not being able to return what they need to. PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY SO THEY DON'T LOSE MONEY ON WALMART PRODUCTS.",0,1

Don't think they need to worry about that...ever.This is a total Customer Care failure. I know they are overwhelmed -- that is why it took so long to get on the schedule. However, that does not make it okay to blindside with a last-minute order cancelation because they are too busy to honor their commitment made 6 days ago.And finally, it seems each of the four representatives thought that by telling me this was happening to others, a lot, that somehow this would make me feel better about it...misery loves company mentality?

So, they issued me only a partial refund for the vitamin C that records show neither bottle has shipped yet. How creative! Now I must spend my time trying to get back all my money for a product they probably never had in stock to begin with!",0,1

Came from Illinois and I live in Ohio! I could have drove there numerous times and would have picked it up next day. Walmart no help at all! Gave me a confirmation that it was shipped on April 2. It wasn't shipped at all! USPS never received the item. I called them personally and USPS confirmed that shipping label was created but they have never received item. Called Walmart customer service and was told I would get a refund (which I never did)!!!! Then I emailed them about refund because you can't get ahold of their customer service by phone unless you wait hours on hold! Apparently EVERYONE is having issues with them as customer service is so backed up. 3 days after I sent email they send me some general information about returning items and cancelling order!! Are you kidding me! I already talked to someone about getting a refund and he assured me I was getting one then they send this idiotic email! Then, of all things, a few days later I get a email saying my item has shipped! It finally arrives on April 18. Apparently they don't want to issue any refunds and will make you wait weeks for your order!! Totally incompetent and uncaring! If you need your order right away, as promised!, your out of luck at Walmart! Order from anyone else but Walmart!! You have been warned!!",0,1

Walmart,This is possibly the worst company to…,"This is possibly the worst company to order from online. I ordered a couple of sets of dumbbells just before the pandemic hit. They said was in stock and shipping was 2 weeks out. They never updated my shipping during this time and customer service said everything is fine. Then day of delivery, the order is delayed. Customer service says they don’t have the ability to contact warehouse to find out why? What the? Why have a customer service department that does nothing different than your app? Waste of manpower. They send message to upper management. They never call me just send a email that’s it’s out of stock. What the what? It was in stock when I ordered it. So are you are overselling product you don’t have? Not so. It turns out during this two week wait, Walmart had been shipping multiple dumbbells to all Walmart stores instead of fulfilling orders online. I know this because through my local Walmart, I tracked the trucks coming in and picked up some of my orders myself (because I didn’t trust online). So instead of fulfilling actual orders online, they decided it was more cost effective to ship to stores (BTW option to ship to store for customer unavailable). Just terrible experience from beginning to end from all levels of this company. Best example of what NOT to do with a business practice model.",0,1
Walmart,100% Satisfaction is NOT guaranteed,"I've been using grocery pickup for about 6 months or so & I've never really had a problem.

I called their lil customer ""care"" line & the guy told me I had to return the item INSIDE the store. I said uhhh we're in the midst of a global pandemic... I use grocery pickup to avoid going INSIDE the store. It was a $9 item. I said you could've emailed me a gift card or something for the inconvenience but the only solution was to take the item back to the store. Wow. Just wow.

Walmart,"GREAT on one hand, horrible on the other","I had a great experience earlier today with a representative named Andre! He cared about my concerns and made an effort to make sure that I was satisfied before I got off the phone. He spent about 30 minutes verifying information, contacting the sender of my item, along with UPS. I had an issue where an item said that it was shipped and delivered but was delivered to the wrong address (we think I was given the wrong tracking number). Five stars for him and his time and superior service.Before I talked to him, I wrote a negative review about the seller and wanted to retract it before it was posted, but forgot to ask how to do so on the call. I decided to chat back and I spoke to a woman named Linda J. and she was VERY rude. I asked about cancelling a review on an item, because it was solved with the representative earlier, and she couldn't give me any answers on how to do that, nor did she try. Her solution was ""contact the company,"" which I was clearly doing by talking with her. TERRIBLE customer service and makes me understand why people say service is hit or miss. 1 star for her. I understand that they are busy, but I wasted 1.5 hours on chat waiting just to be treated like another number.",0,5

I was toldt all items would brbat the store on the 21st and today I get a notice that the mattresses are delayed. What good is a bed without a freaking mattress.All in all I can only say there is not a low enough number for me to give for Walmart.com service. This is not just a one time issue. It is every time I order a Walmart.com. It took me four different times to order and four different models to get a freaking printer for my phone. And now something urgently need like a bed that I ordered a week ago and was told would be here suddenly is not in stock. Walmart does not monitor their stock on hand numbers. If it is not there do not tell me it will be delivered on a certain date and if you tell me It’s going to be delivered on a certain date don’t sell it to someone else! Hold it for me to pick up on the date WALMART said they would all be available!If my items were available from any other source I would never order from Walmart.com.

Walmart,Walmart please help nurses,"Let me just start by saying I like Walmart, at least I used to. Before this madness I used to in the Valley Stream Walmart every week. But it's the second time that I've tried to get grocery from there as a nurse and have had to leave. I tried last week Tuesday and again this morning; I was told that I should come at 6:00 a.m. on a Wednesday. I was in uniform and I had on my work ID and I told by the associate at the door that I get off work at 7:30 am and would not be able to come at that time. He pretty much told me that he could do nothing about that. I never usually ask for special privileges and I think the other people in the line need their groceries too, but having a nurse wait on a line for 3 hours in this time is ludicrous. If people could only understand what's happening in the hospitals they would give us a little chance to get some grocery. Everyday another one of my coworkers get sick, we are supposed to work with 5 nurses and now we are happy when we have 3. Patients are dying around like nothing we've ever seen. It takes a strong resolve and determination to get up and keep going to try to save some more lives. And make no mistake about it that that is exactly what we're doing. If we don't show up for work the impact of this pandemic will be greater so I do feel like we deserve a little privilege. Standing on a line for 3 hours or more when I just finished a 13 hour shift and have to go back to work later in the evening is not the best use of us as nurses. I wonder how the associate would feel if they show up with covid symptoms and a healthcare worker tells them to come back next Wednesday at 6:00 a.m.",0,1

I'm giving them a 4 rather than a 1 because the person in their customer service handling my issue was great . The item originally sent was damaged. Walmart replaced it with no questions. The 2nd item replacement , never showed up. Was lost in shipping. The person handling my issue took time to track down the shipment and found it was never delivered. Although the shipping company had it marked down as delivered. The customer service agent then gave me a discount and refund on my item and reordered. Finally I received the item.A suggestion to those with issues when calling the customer service -- use patience and don't get upset . Work with the customer service person to get it resolved.

If so, I will be a satisfied customer and will continue to use Walmart. I also am disappointed that you can't order many items online and have to go into the store such as TP and certain food items.

They keep you waiting and hope they get stuff in that they never had to begin with. Then they cancel on you. DO NOT DEPEND on them for anything that is a necessity. BEWARE!!!,0,1
Walmart,This is specifically about the…,"This is specifically about the Wall-Mart on Chef Menteur in New Orleans. I go out of my way to go to this Wal-Mart but the action of the pharmacy today has left me out done!At 4:48, I received a message that the COUGH medicine I have been waiting for since Thursday, because given that COVID-19 is primarily a COUGH, Wal-Mart, a pharmacy that I go to because I can get medicine there for less than 1/4 what it costs, with insurance, at the nearest pharmacy, let the COUGH MEDICINE supply run out, knowing, because they told me so when I called, that there would not be another delivery for 5 days. The same text said that the pharmacy was open until 6. I threw on clothes and a used mask, drove across town, waited in line snaking all around the parking lot, 6 ft away from crazy people with no or inadequate protection, touching all over baskets and cavorting around, for 30 minutes, got into the store, went to the pharmacy where there was a whole line of people, 6ft apart staring incredulously at the cages trying to figure out what the procedure was because we had all gotten texts at the same time that our medicine was ready. Finally, a Wal-Mart worker confirmed that the pharmacy, WHICH HAD JUST TEXTED A BUNCH OF SICK PEOPLE TO COME GET OUR MEDICINES AND MADE US STAND IN LINE FOR 30 MINUTES IN THE PARKING LOT, was closed 1 hour early--and hadn't bothered to text that salient fact. I have asthma, COPD, and sarcoidosis through no fault of my own and am firmly in the group most likely to die and these people capriciously risked my and others' lives to leave an hour early for something they didn't know about 12 minutes earlier when they sent the text telling us to come get our medications?",0,3
Walmart,Wal-Mart: Small business plague.,"Wal-Mart is to mom and pop businesses in the U.S. what the black plague was to Europe and our society will pay for it. You put businesses that actually cared about their communities out to pasture. You then pay your workers low and expect the federal government to pick up the tab. You encourage your employees to go on welfare and use government programs as a health plan. It's disgusting. I will drive 15 miles out of my way before I'll walk into one of your Chinese-made, local economy-killing, ""super"" stores that are anything but.",0,1

I am a CNA and there was a walmart employee right across from us when we were doing self check out and she had a mask on but was not wearing it at all and was all up in peoples faces and so were the other workers that were there. We had our masks on and our gloves doing what is supposed to be safe for us not to catch this virus and the walmart employees are walking around getting in peoples faces and not doing the 6 feet apart and just having conversations. In my opinion they are not only risking my clients health but also mine. So in my opinion they need to be looked into and watched to make sure they are doing what everyone else is doing and stop being all up in peoples faces without wearing masks. The woman was talking to him in his face for at least 25 minutes without having her mask pulled up on her face. Instead she had it pulled down and was in peoples faces and she wasn't even a csm. These CSM are doing the same thing getting in your face without wearing mask and what really gets me is that they are wanting to ignore this virus like it is some flu which is not nothing like the flu this is much, much worse. It is killing people and people like that act like they dont give a dang at all. So something needs to be done, to prevent the spread in Walmart thru their employees that are ignoring protocol.",0,1

The shopping technology loading the cart itself is pretty good, but the experience is poorly designed. They need new IT.",0,1

Walmart,The Dangers of Shopping at Walmart,"I needed some groceries. So, I went to Walmart. I noticed a man pushing carts back into the store. He had no gloves on. Inside I noticed that none of the employees had masks or gloves. When I checked out, the cashier was wiping down the counter. I asked her whether Walmart provided masks or gloves. She quietly told me ""no"". Walmart is the largest bricks and mortar store in the United States. They rake in over $374.80 billion a year. That should be enough money to supply personal protective devices to their employees. They are risking the lives of their employees during COVID-19. People are dieing and Walmart, obviously, does not care if this happens to their employees.This is not just a health risk for the employees but for shoppers as well. If a shopper touches a cart that someone with Coronavirus has touched, they could become infected. If an employee who has been exposed, breaths on a patron, they could become infected. It doesn't matter how many times the employees wipe down the counters if they are not protected from breathing the same air as people who have the disease. Hundreds of people go through their lines everyday. Some of those people have COVID-19. Cashiers are being exposed. Then, customers are exposed to the cashiers. Everyone in the store is risking their life.Walmart is completely negligent in their approach to this deadly disease. Yes, there is a line of carts that shoppers need to go around to enter the store but this is unimportant compared to what is really needed. Once in the store, employees and shoppers face a dangerous situation.",0,1

Walmart,Unfortunately do to where i live being…,"Unfortunately do to where i live being full of disrespectful destructing people especially people that work at and shop at Walmart. I'v had not one not three but a number of extremely severe incidents i would love to sue Walmart right out of business for. #1 being the parking lot grocery cart guy put a huge dent in my brand new car not even a week old. The food is disgustingly toxic. I don't eat any packaged food bagged, boxed, caned so i mean vegetables, meat and dairy. I don't drink milk so by dairy i mean eggs. Walmart eggs made me sick for a year until i figured it out. I cant tell you how many times i'v gotten sick off Walmart food. I get organic eggs now. After having proved to me for so many years that i have to shop organic to not get sick and be health i just listen now. After eating 6 eggs a day my entire life i don't eat eggs anymore. That go's to show you everything is in your head. If i could forgive Walmart for making me sick for a year i know i could eat eggs again. There throat drops made my mouth itch thus making me cough, took me few day to figure out it was there natural throat drops. Went to Publix got the same exact throat drops no itch or couch and they help my throat. Walmart food has taken at least a good 10-15 years off my life. I can't imagine how deadly there packaged food is. Don't be a victim of being cheap take 5 years off your life. This is exactly why smart people grocery shop at an actual grocery store. They say COVID-19 isn't (suppose) to effect are pets, wanna bet. I use to get my dogs food there cause Walmart is the only place that carries it, but when COVID-19 started my dogs food started making him sick. Thank gyd i found 2 brands at Petsmart he really likes. I very recently stopped using Walmart Pharmacy. Every time there was a change to my medication even just dosage they could never get it right! For example: The Dr. and i would agree on the medication and how many. Do to not being the one that gets the prescription and being two long names for every medication. I knew it was not right cause i knew the number and/or the dosage and they never matched theres. After having to ague with them like 7 times in 2 yrs. For someone that despises confrontation more then anyone. I finally decided this stresses me out far more then convenience is worth. The ONLY reason Walmart would get any of this one star is cause they carry No Boundaries Clothing, even though that really has nothing to do with Walmart and everything to do with No Boundaries. Know matter how much i never want to spend a cent at Walmart cause they owe me money to fix my car. Tragically its the most convenient place to shop for almost everything closest to me anyway. Most of the time i go much farther away to Super Target. I go there more, all the same people, there food is a lot less toxic and not one incident ever. Ummmmm why do you think that is?Now i treat Walmart exactly the same way i do the dollar store if i just have to go there DO NOT GET ANYTHING THAT GO'S IN OR ON YOU! Whatever you do at least dont eat poultry until COVID-19 is completely over. If you dont watch Netflix documentaries poultry is one 3 species that carries COVID-19 not to mention meat factories are full of COVID-19 cases. With are new normal world now, when it comes to food this is the time to take care of yourself and your family!",0,1

Walmart,Got my grocery order cancelled after expressing dissatisfaction about the previous grocery order cancelled,"I ordered groceries online scheduled for pick up but Walmart cancelled it on the pickup day ""due to unusually high demand"". Thinking that they just ran out of groceries that day (since there is a fixed number of allocated time slots and I already reserved one, this couldn't be a problem with the time slots, so I thought) I managed to reorder the pickup for another day. Everything was available. This morning they had a nerve to send me a survey about my pickup experience which I rated low as they didn't provide for that experience. Within minutes I got my second order cancelled ""due to unusually high demand"", a day prior to the pickup. This is just bs. They can't predict if there will be unusually high demand in the future. Maybe, when all pick up slots are already booked, managers are just knocking down existing orders and giving (selling?) those spots to somebody else, like family, friends, noisy complainers on the phone, whatever. My first cancellation might've been random, the second one was targeted. I won't shop at Walmart anymore, even after the epidemic is over. I wasn't asking for any special consideration, just to fulfill the contract, fair and square.",1,1

Walmart,Hirrendeous Customer Service. Still without a Resolution,"Purchased a Treadmill Online. Whomever delivered it over a week ago, I believe Fed-Ex didn’t have the decency to ring my bell and I was home, so it was left outside in the rain. I go outside to find a soaked box that was so soggy, it was falling apart. After opening the box, I find a damaged treadmill. I called Walmart immediately, but there was over an hour wait time. Tried their chat option, but no one responded. After a few days, someone did return my call, but in the meantime, I contacted the Treadmill company to inform them of my problem, and the Bank who issued payment to Walmart to try to find a resolution. I started a return process online with Walmart, was told it would be picked up and a freight company would call me to discuss pick up. I informed them putting it in a soggy box was not an option, and was told it was fine. Due to the Pandemic of this horrible virus, we discussed my having it left outside for pick up. I discussed this with Walmart and the freight company and we agreed that it should be left outside which I did the night before, since they were to pick up in the morning. I go outside around 10:30 am to find it was picked up. Then at 1:30 a truck comes to pick it up. I informed him it was already picked up and he stated “it’s not the first time this happened and that Walmart must have had someone else pick it up”. I then call Walmart and they inform me “They can not locate who picked it up”. Seriously? Where is it? I’ve been left on hold for hours between Walmart and their Corporate Office, And a week and 1/2 later no resolution. Walmart has been my go-to store for years, but after this experience, I’m done. The audacity to tell me to put a dispute in with my bank is ridiculous! I should be dealing directly with you, Walmart. Where is the treadmill?

Walmart,Walmart’s Policy put elderly at risk,"Let me begin by saying that I think it is great that Walmart is limiting how much people can purchase - rationing items that are in short supply. However, the Walmart policy makes no provision for young people who are shopping for elderly parents. I went to Walmart to shop for my elderly mother and father in law as well as my own family. I tried to buy a bottle of bleach for each household and I was told one per customer. I explained politely that I was buying for two different households and the store manager said that did not matter and went on to say that the elderly immune compromised people I was buying for could come to the store themselves. We asked the Walmart Manager if we could register, we could show proof that we were buying for two households. The Manager said that they would make no provision to help. I then asked if I paid and left the store and then came back could I buy the items being rationed on my second visit and she said if she saw me in her store again today she would refuse me service. Anyway, I paid for the items they would allow me to have and then went down the street and bought the other items needed from another store. We want the elderly and especially those with health issues to stay home, but then Walmart sets up policies without any way to assist those buying for multiple households. I would expect Walmart to have a more humanitarian and rational policy in place to help people shop for multiple households. I called Walmart Corporate and they took the same hard line. In closing I support supplies being limited. In hind sight I should have had my wife go to one line to buy our stuff and I should have gone into another line to buy the items for my father and mother in law. However, that seems very dishonest, but I am sure people are doing that to get around the Walmart policy. Walmart - PLEASE CONSIDER A POLICY AND PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE SHOPPING FOR ELDERLY RELATIVES WITH IMMUNE COMPROMISED HEALTH SYSTEMS.",0,1

Walmart,Love the Product even though it was slightly damaged.,"I recently ordered a deep freezer online. I received the package a day earlier than expected. Due to the large size it was left in front of the building which is more of the UPS's fault than Walmart. I was able to get my package. I noticed that it had a few dents in it nothing major but I realized that this is a common occurrence with this particular product when it is purchased online. The product works perfectly and I decided to keep rather than return it because according to purchasers online who had returned it, the product still came back damaged sometimes worse. I think Walmart needs to work on how these products are being stored. I've worked in a warehouse and I'm aware of how easily products can be damaged especially if not stored or handled properly. The fact that the box had no visible damage makes me think it was damaged either at the factory or at the warehouse. It needs to be rectified especially for online consumers who have limited time and have no interest in having to actually go to the store to make an exchange or get a refund.",0,4

Is it possible to hold back some of these products for when you open at 6 a.m. for us senior citizens?????? Very very few toilets papers - probably about 10 or 20 rolls.

Walmart,Walmart.com is the absolute worst,"Walmart.com is the absolute worst! I was recently looking for a trampoline for my daughter so I went on the website. The store near me showed 5 in stock.so I drove to the store to find nothing in stock. I had to order it off the website which I absolutely hate doing however did it anyway. The shipping said 2 days. After 2 days I received a text that my trampoline showed up, drove to the store and come to find out that only 1 of the 2 boxes had shown up. Of course the associate knew nothing so I called walmart.com. There I was told that the second box was on a delivery truck on the way to the store and that I would get a call the next day. Ya no call. So I called walmart.com again for the second time and was told this time that my box was in a FedEx warehouse it might show up in a day or so. I was given a tracking number. Called Walmart.com for a third time and expressed what was going on. I was instructed to return my first box and just reorder the whole thing again. I had asked them to order it for me because that makes no sense and the associate told me the supplier was out of stock. I reached out to the complaint Dept and again was instructed to reorder the product myself and pay for a second one. So as frustrated as I was I went on the website and nowhere did it say they were out of stock. I had been lied to numerous times by Walmart.com. I ventured out to another Walmart for a few things and walked by 6 trampolines on the floor. Wow Walmart thanks for the terrible costumer service and horrible website",0,1

Walmart,"Coon Rapids, Minnesota Walmart has the WORST customer service of anyone!","I received an email from Walmart saying my order was processed for pickup. the problem was that I didn't order anything. I checked my charge card and saw someone bought an electronic item for $181.04. I immediately froze my charge card and a few minutes later, another charge came through for the same amount, which was blocked because of me. I tried calling that store and nobody answered in electronics, so I tried customer service...who also didn't answer. I tried this four times and with no luck, I got a hold of the pharmacy manager. I apologized for bothering him, but said nobody would answer their phone and asked if he could connect me with a manager. He said that no managers were accepting calls and that I needed to come in to the store if I wanted to talk to a manager. I told him that there's no way I was going to drive that far to come in, as this location wasn't close to my house, especially during this virus situation. I explained that this wasn't a call to see if they had toilet paper, it was because someone stole my charge card information and was trying to commit fraud. I told him this was urgent and I needed him to connect me to ANY manager right away. Again, he said no and then had the gall to hang up on me! I gave him the benefit of the doubt and called back and got a hold of him again. I told him we got disconnected and he said to me, I'm not hooking you up to a manager and hung up on me again! What an utter horrific display of customer service...the worst ever! I will never step foot in any Walmart ever again!!",0,1

Walmart,Walmart Distribution center In Fort Worth Tx has Corona Virus Case (3/17/2020)!!!,"My wife currently works at a Walmart Distribution Center and Saturday(3/21/20) when she got to work (6 am) they had a meeting as they do daily. Come 5 pm (an hour before her shift ended, they held another meeting to alert employees that on Tuesday (3/17/20) there was an employee that had contracted the Corona Virus. A lot of the employees got upset, which is understandable, and decided to go home right then. Why let your employees work an entire 12 hour shift before telling them that they were at risk? Cause Walmart only cares about their money and not their employees. They told the employees that were leaving that they could take no less than 4 days off and no more than 14 days off, just to see if they get sick or not. What kind of company does that? You would think that they would have sent out emails to their employees letting them know what happened after it happened. We're talking a whole 4 days here. I told her she is not returning at all. No company should allow their workers to work an entire shift without notifying them that they are now at risk of catching a virus that is being considered a global pandemic. Shame on Walmart. They would rather let you work and make them money before advising you of what is going on. I don't shop at Walmart, and I'm glad because they would have surely lost a customer. Also, as a side note, they are not hiring anyone to come in and disinfect there either. They told the workers to just wipe their area down with alcohol and wipes and to just continue practicing safe measures. ??? Seriously? Walmart SUCKS! There's no telling how many have it now. And they want the workers that left to keep quiet about it and they will waive points for missing work if they do so. HA! smh",0,1

Walmart,Wally World,"Currently wal mart sucks because of the nut jobs taking everything off the shelves. So I can’t even shop. Other than that, I like the low prices on most of the things they sell. The off brand is pretty much exactly the name brand. And they offer more off brand things than our Wegmans in upstate NY does. Which helps when you’re a single mom with 2 kids. The clearance isle is nice after the holidays! Everything is so cheap, like the price it should be sold at to begin with! It has its pros and cons. Overall I like it but I don’t LOVE it. If I was banking bucks I’d choose Wegmans over Walmart. Oh! And the wait time for an employee is AWFUL! They aren’t doing anything anymore since they have 2 people at a register cashing people Out.

Walmart,The shutdown at night is a joke.,"The shutdown at night for ""sanitation and restocking"" at Walmart is a joke. This morning we went at 7am for the ""special"" hour for seniors. There was NO wet wipes to wipe off the cart handles. The shelves were not stocked, employees were pushing huge ""stocking carts"" through the store being in everyone's way while the ""seniors"" were trying to shop because of the susceptibility of elderly people to the Coronavirus.

Some of them also lost their lives working in factories with terrible working conditions! Walmart (Freestyle) is one of the brands (also Primark, Waikiki) named on the tags of the clothing showed in this doc. Just terrifying... These brands are just interested in making profits with NO RESPECT FOR LIFE. Hopefully, I have never bought anything from this clothing brands. If brands have no respect for human rights, then consumers should react by NOT buying anything from them & protesting. How could you, dear consumer, think of buying things for $5? Who pays all the workers of the whole supply chain? Awful quality and low price means EXPLOITATION OF HUMAN LIVES. Snap out of it!",0,1
Walmart,With the Corona Virus in full swing and…,With the Corona Virus in full swing and unable to get the necessities needed for my family I showed up at my local store in Greeley Colorado at 5am. 1 hour before the store opens up. At 5:10 I was in line waiting for the opening when one of the employees walked out the side door with a shopping cart full of paper towels and toilet paper. This was long before the store opened up. I was the first one in the door and the first one to the empty toilet paper isle. Apparently Walmart condones this as I reported it. I was asked for proof and told them that they could verify the time stamp on their video system as well as the vehicle license plate number and make/model that I gave them. walmart doesn’t care,0,1

When I have a return I have to wait till I have a few returns and try to do them all at once .. reason is walkmart only allows you to return items with out a receipt over $25 or totaling over $25 ( 3 ) times a year!!!! This is ridiculous ! I spend so much money there and will only takke the store credit ( which is all I ask for I lost my receipt so there’s an expected penalty) but to only allow 3no receipt returns a year ... that’s just wrong! I feel that I am retuning an item, especially if it’s a great value product .. or items .. then I should be given a store credit as many times as I bring my items in m... not being greedy because I’m just going to come back at ankther time to purchase other items I need .. using said store credit!

Walmart,EMPLOYEES GET FIRST DIBS AND WITHHOLD MUCH NEEDED ITEMS TO KEEP FOR THEMSELVES,"I have been going to Wal Mart in Port St. Lucie for 17 years and was treated horribly by Employee Christina today when she followed me to the other side of the store to pick a fight with me by calling me a ""Puta."" I objected to their employees having access to much needed paper products in the back of the store and hoarding it for themselves. While we waited for 20 minutes for them to bring more paper towels napkins and of course toilet paper, they held it in back while their employees got 24 packs for themselves while keeping it from paying customers. When I went to the other side of the store to get away from this obviously angry employee, she followed me, called me names in Spanish and used intimidating tactics to try and scare me. All while waiting for me to give up on waiting for what I needed and called me stupid because I didn't get it sooner. This employee needs to be fired! The manager is so scared of her she would not confront her even after Christina threatened to have me removed from the store for complaining. Other employees are well aware that she is a difficult employee because they were ""not surprised"" when I informed management of her name calling and stalking. If Wal Mart employees need items they should have to shop and wait for them like the rest of us, instead they hoard it all for themselves leaving none for us, shameful!",0,1

They have all these people that don't speak English and don't know what you're talking about and its really really pathetic. a simple thing like beef bouillon and they don't even know what it is they look at you like you're on crack or something but yet they let these people work there. I'm surprised they are still open. they close the stores that are worth something and leave worthless Walmart open actually two worthless Walmarts. The reason is for being as big as store as they are they don't carry anything I've been looking for frames for months and they still have a bare shelf which is normal for them unless of course it's dirt because these store are so filthy and dirty it's disgusting I'm talking about both stores in Grand forks North Dakota. maybe they should get the people that don't know English to clean the store instead of trying to wait on customers that they can't understand and getting away with talking to each other in their Somalian language so customers can't understand what they're saying about you I think it's sad to have people working there like that!

Walmart,This company hires managers and clerks who don't care,"After reading Yelp reviews about Encinitas CA Wal-Mart, I see others have had very similar experiences as my family has encountered. It's not just the clerks that don't want to be bothered, it's the supervisors in the early evening shifts as well that are out on the floor. I wonder if Ruby the onsite manager would of behaved so rudely and unresponsive if her store manager was on site. Perhaps the store manager doesnt care either and the employees sense it? Often times, the issues start at the top and trickle down. Clearly, Wal-Mart isn't taking action on all these similar negative experiences. I ask, why are the clerks acting like they hate their jobs and act as if they are miserable and ignore customers. Target employees are responsive and pleasant. Walmart take notice, be more selective on who you hire because customers take notice of sour supervisors roaming the floors and goofing off ignoring customers. Don't support and shop at Walmart.

The Walmart had 4 registers open and all were right next to each other. I saw the same thing a few days ago at a Walmart near my work. About 40 customers got bottlenecked within feet of each other. I asked for the manager and explained that they need to spread the open registers so they don't force most of their customers in a close proximity that is not safe with the coronavirus taking a foothold in our country. Her response was I just do what I'm told and the store manager doesn't care if he's putting their customers in danger. Ive already called the news and I'll be emailing the CEO but you need to be safe. PLEASE BOYCOTT WALMART UNTIL THEY START ACTING RESPONSIBLY AND CARING ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS!!,0,1

Walmart,WalMart grocery delivery is a good idea…,"WalMart grocery delivery is a good idea in theory, poor in execution. You place your items in a cart and they all show in stock, but if they don't have the item they substitute and whoever picks what to substitute doesn't have a history of your orders and just picks something, mostly something you don't want or need. When you get your delivery you don't have a chance to reject the substitutions. If they are unsatisfactory you can go through the whole ""off shore"" call center routine and explain and they refund you, without having to return the items. That always makes me feel like I'm cheating, so I don't call every time. You can mark things as do not substitute, but then if they are out of stock, you get nothing. The cost of the service is reasonable, but then you tip the driver. Tips are going to cost me more than I paid for a year of delivery. They say you don't have to tip but when you log in to set up the next delivery it asks how your delivery went and if you want to tip your driver. You also get an email asking if you want to tip them. I do tip my driver, but in cash when they deliver. I could go on and on.",0,2
Walmart,Poor and Horrible Service,"Honestly I use multiple delivery services and this is the first time I was using them. They have a system where reps cannot make changes to the system despite me calling them and letting know I DO NOT need substitutes. They substituted items without my permission nor I use those items. They use DoorDash to deliver and they tell me to return items myself going to store. I rejected that offer and why should I receive items that I did not order. Finally poor Doordash delivery person took them and handed over to store. I got a call from the Walmart store and the guy I spoke said he will inform higher ups to not charge for items substituted. This is pain have to deal with multiple people and cannot get it resolved, despite calling them. Hey Warren Buffet - are you listening. Oh BTW I use Amazon fresh produce as well and see how their system works.",0,1
Walmart,Price issue. Poor customer service.,"My comment is that I looked on the walmart website for microwaves. I seen there was a microwave from the store in my area that was marked on clearance for a very low price. I went to the store and went to the aisle and I seen the shelf tag stated a 5x higher price then the website. I went to the check out and scanned the Microwave and it came up as the higher price. I politely asked a leader from the sales floor to look at my discrepancy. She took my phone and scrolled and seen that it was definitely a mistake online. She stated that this always happens and was going to walk away. I stated that it was false advertisement and that I wanted it for the lower price it stated it was. She retrieved a manager for approval and the manager stated that she can only give me 10% off which was about $6 when I should've saved $50. I wasn't asking for 10 microwaves to be marked down. I was asking for them to mark the one down. She refused. I called the customer service line and they stated it was manager discrepancy. I myself manage a retail chain, and with an issue like this we would own the solution and guarantee the price. Wow...a multi-billion dollar company does not care about their customers and own responsibility for ""their"" mistake. Your policy is poorly done Walmart think about your customers. Not everyone is out to scam they do deserve to be right too. Unfortunately I had to put my review on here because it was too long for walmart.com comments.",0,1

While on hold another man came on wanting to help, he wanted my information and the tracking information which I explained that I was on hold for the other guy. I decided he was going to fix my problem. I gave him my information and then he wanted the tracking information which I do not have since the item was being picked up in another place. He got frustrated and transferred me to another man. With this man I explained that I did not have the tracking information and at this time I couldn't get a hold of the person to find it.

At this point Walmart has taken my money and I don't have no product or any word of a product, exchange, refund, nothing at all. Beware when ordering from Walmart.com because they have third parties to send out their merchandise. My next step to get my refund is the Better Business Bureau.",0,1

Walmart,Horrible experience! Beware,"I used to enjoy going to Walmart but, today at 7pm I went to the location on 92nd and Flagler and to my surprise i noticed there was only one cashier and the rest were the self service cashiers where the customers have to ring up tier own groceries and bag them. This is ok for someone who buying a few things but for me and many others I saw the frustration and the struggle, waiting in line 45 mins to an hour to pay grocery of aproximately $300, waiting around 40 minutes at the deli to get ham & cheese, plus many of the items I normally buy they were all out. I personally feel this is a huge lack of respect to the employees and loyal customers e everyone was miserable and it was the worse experience I ever had buying groceries. Walmart now even discriminatory there are no Handy cap areas for the disabled ederly customer, and in my case I had to call a manager to finally get help.Anyway for what its worth, I used spend minimum 800 to $1000 a month but now I will take my business to Publixs where it might cost a little more but the service is fast, plesent and plenty of happy employees to help all of their valued customers. My recomendation Don't go to Walmart it's a nightmare. All they want is to force people to order online from them to save on labor cost and continue getting richer with no respect for the people who got them where they are at now.",0,1

I immediately, within less than a minute cancelled the order but did not have any response.After three hours I contacted walmart.com support and they told me that the cancellation request had already been made and it would take 24 hours to process. Well it didn't take them 24hrs to charge my account the full cost... Their customer support is useless.This is the second time I've had an issue with this website, the 1st time was when I purchased a TV from them 4-5 years ago and had my credit card info stolen.I am done with walmart.com, I have already all my card info and as soon as the order cancellation processes I will have my walmart.com account deleted permanently.",0,1

Walmart,ONE regular check / verses self check out ...,"ONE regular check out only during the busiest time of the day. WHAT""S WITH THAT! The rest were self check outs and another employee trying to get everyone to go thru' the self check-outs. Needless to say while in the single line so many of the people were saying this is why ""I"" don't shop at Walmart any more. They're killing their own business. My solution to self checkouts to get more people to use them would be to offer a 10% discount if one self checks out. One can see using them if they have very few items but if I have a cart full I'm not going thru self check out only to be stopped like someone else said at door like a criminal and for another employee to go thru what I self checked out. Where's the time saving solution to that. Use to shop 2-3 times a week at Walmart now it's maybe 1-2 times a month. So there you go ...gotta love how a business can really do itself in by progress ...",0,3
Walmart,I've had the Walmart app since it first…,"I've had the Walmart app since it first came out. Essentially, it has the same information that is stated on Walmart.com. I use the app for almost everything from finding what is sold in my local store, to refilling prescriptions, to locating and isle number I can find my item in. I absolutely love being able to simply go to the store and instead of bugging a busy shelf-stocker, I can just open the app, search for whatever I'm looking for, and see which isle the item is in. Also, being that I'm on numerous medications and they all seem to need refilled at different times, Walmart makes it extremely easy to request a refill online and emails you as soon as it's done so you don't have to go to the store waiting forever and a day for your refill to process. Overall, Walmart.com and the Walmart app are completely innovative and have a great user interface that makes it easy-to-use for all ages! Again, HIGHLY suggest the app!",0,5
Walmart,Who are the Real Criminals in the Store...,"Hi have been a customer of Walmart a long time, but in this past year or so the ""store"" itself has gone downhill. They are always out of something or some item that they have had in the past and the inventory tracking is terrible!!! I don't care how many ""robots"" they put in a store ...their intention is for the consumer to buy what the have in stock INSTEAD!!! The all the ""Face Recognition"" screens and Alarm Gates they have--who do they think they are???? No other store with class puts that type of junk in their stores. Then after you have gone through the Register Line or Self-Checkout, you are bombarded by a door employee who wants to check your Register Slip of your purchases, after you already stood in line (sometimes 10 minutes) to PAY for your goods. Makes you feel like a criminal...like I am robbing the store. Catch those damn folks who made this bad for all of us who are honest and pay good money out and spend the actual time in the store. One more thing...all the ""PICK-UP"" Orders, the employees filling those orders seem to be more important than those of us who SHOP in your store. Your Corporation must be sick about how they handle decent people. Quite shoving those cameras in our face, and pushing your stupid robots in our way in the SMALL ailises. Those ailises keep getting smaller. I walked by mistake through one of of gates the other day to leave the store, mind you I had not bought anything...the alarm went off like I was a crook...yes, yes I know it says on the sign ""Emergency Exit Only""...well I shouldn't be treated like that after 20+ year customer. Your store should worry but it isn't about the criminals, you should worry about how stupid you look. Spend that extra money (Face Recognition and Robots) on your loyal employees who have been there a long time and who are really the heart of the company!!! I wish your store would be a normal store...get back how you used to be a nice store without all that crap to find criminals...and don't say catching the criminals with keep prices lower...I don't BUY that!!!",0,2
Walmart,Bait and switch pricing.,"Today was the second time I was duped by Walmart's bait and switch pricing. I purchased a Mainstays Microwave for $53.88 using the Walmart.com app. When I selected the store options, I'm taken to another screen that stated ""Order now pick up in store"" for $13.00 with a date the item can be picked up at this price. When I went to pick up the microwave I still paid the online price, even though I did exactly what the app said to do. Ordered online, and picked up in store. This is a misleading and deceptive pricing tactic. When speaking with associates and even supervisors I was given complex reasons as to why the price shown online could not be honored. This is an issue Walmart and Walmart.com really need to address. If the instore pick up price advertised online is not going to be honored once picked up in the store then it should not be shown. Further complicating the issue is the store not able or unwilling to make price adjustments to honor the price online without having me go through a complicated process. I was told by associates, supervisors and even Walmart phone customer service that in order to receive the pick up price shown online I would have to return the item and wait 24 hours to repurchase at the advertised price. None of this is explained when making the purchase and seems contrary to pricing policies stated online by Walmart. Either do away with showing diffeerent pick up prices or streamline the price adjustment process so customers like myself are not deceived.I had a similar experience with another purchase. However when I went to customer service the associate made the adjustment quick and easy. I've also made an online purchase for pick up at a different Walmart location and upon pick up the price was instantly adjusted to the store price. So again I implore Walmart and Walmart.com to update and/or honor its advertised pricing. For me I've been duped by this misleading practice one to many times now, I'll be sticking with Amazon.com for my online purchases until Walmart/Walmart.com fixes this problem. I'll also be contacting my local news WSB channel 2 and 11 alive investigative reporters to see if they are interested in doing a story on this. I think others should be aware of the scrupulous bait and switch tactics of Walmart.",0,2

The order stated it's arrived at the store. I got an email stated its delayed for pick up at 5 pm on 2/28/20 with no reason as to why. I have been calling everyday since to speak with someone at the store to figure out when I can expect to pick it up. Again today the run around with no answers. They have no problem withdrawing the money from my account and just give me run around. Now I spoke with wallmart and they say it's not there. This is a waste of time and obvious no care or concern for the consumer and no explanation. To get a refund I have to deal with Wallmart .com now. This is a joke. All I need is an explanation as to how long I have to wait. Why is this so hard?,0,2
Walmart,The absolute WORST!,"I only gave a 1 start rating because I couldnt give none. Anyway Walmart is the absolute worst for online shipping. I mean the WORST.

Well monday comes my bed wasnt delivered, I check my shipping status just to find out that my oder was recieved at my local FedEx but the was shipped away to another state through the night. I called Walmart got the absolute run around, I mean talked to people who had zero clue what they were talking about, I was hung up on multiple times. I mean it was absolutely terrible. I was the guaranteed for my package to be here the following day (Tuesday) still didnt come Tuesday. My husband called & got a hold of someone who finally knew a little bit of what was going on. Finally it came 2 days later. We just opened the box to find out that ITS THE WORNG BED!! We also found out that there was our shipping label plus someone else's label and shipping info with the state it was sent to so that's why it was sent to the other state. I just called Walmart online number and was told that they can refund my money but I have to return the bed to a store. Also found out the bed I ordered is no longer in stock!!!

Walmart,Order an emergency food kit to update…,"Order an emergency food kit to update my earthquake kit and it was charged to my card, received my confirmation email and a delivery date. Apparently the price shot up later that week because now everybody became freaked out about this flu called Corona so Walmart simply just cancelled my order. They didn't even inform me of this, no email, nothing. Today I realized that the delivery date was in a few days and I haven't received a follow up email so I checked my account and saw that it has been cancelled. When I talked to customer service they try to claim that my bank put a hold on my credit card and I wasn't charged. That was a LIE! I told him that I was charged and when will I get my order. Well I'm not because (as he lies to me again!) That it was out of stock when I ordered it. I told him again it was not out of stock because I was charged and SENT a confirmation email. At this point he went on how it must be frustrating blah blah blah. YES, it is frustrating when a business just cancels your order without any reason so they can mark it up and make more money on the product and to continually lie to you about what happen! Hey Walmart you truly live up to your rep! Thanks for saving me time in the future by never shopping with you again and to always stay with a truly great and honest business called COSTCO! Which I may add isn't depressing to walk into, with every employee there obviously hating their job! On that note, I'm now going to return my iMac pro I just bought because of this and because of your dishonest, NO INTEGRITY practices. I just don't trust you! Thank Paul",0,1

Walmart,Shipping times are lies,Ordered many times from Walmart website and shipping is never in timeframe promised. Most recent was last Wednesday and I made sure everything I ordered was next day delivery eligible. Placed the order and next day the order is updated to a Saturday delivery. Hardly next day. Today is Saturday and after tracking the order for the past couple days it finally moved from processing to shipped. That’s right. The order just ships the date of delivery 3 days after placing an order for next day delivery. Some law firm needs to get something going with a class action lawsuit and finally hold Walmart accountable for their breach of contracts and false advertisement. I hate when corporate giants like this just don’t care about their customers because they are so big and gross revenue is so large they find it insignificant when customers wise up and finally stop shopping with them. Maybe if enough people started dropping them and shopping amazon or target then they might get their heads out of their asses and stop believing they are above consumer laws.

Walmart,"Rotten from the very top, CEO and President, to the very bottom, Customer Service","Horrible, zero response in any way!Copy of correspondence to Walmart:I am awaiting your response as regards this transaction before pursuing any other recourse. You should also be aware that on the day I purchased the printer online, that your website indicated that there were four in stock at our local Walmart, yet when my husband went to buy one immediately, there were none in stock at the store and when he spoke with the store employees, they indicated that they had not had any. My husband called and informed me of this, at which time I put the order in online. In reflecting on what I now know, I feel this could possibly fall under the category of false advertising (not actually having said item), bait-and-switch (we can sell you this other item) and out and out theft (you took money for an item and, though you continue to advertise that item on your web site, you have not produced the item you sold me).

After speaking to several supervisors and then being transferred to Customer Resolutions, the only resolution being offered was to refund my purchase price so I could now purchase the exact same printer for $150 more.I am simply requesting that Walmart honor my purchase and ship the printer to me as soon as possible.

That is not an excuse for poor customer service and if I get a different story every time I call...its YOU not ME.

Walmart,False Advertisement,"Wal-Mart has gotten to big to monitor their own inventory and prices. While shopping online I found some totes the price was marked down and were available at one of my local Walmart’s. When I found them in the store, I made sure the model numbers matched. When I went to purchase them the barcode would not scan at the price they were listed for online, so they would not honor them. This is false advertisement, Walmart prides themselves on price matching. Yet they did not price match their own product. Be careful when using their online feature. I myself will no longer be shopping at Walmart.",0,1

A chat with Walmart support right after order confirming promo and now Walmart refusing to honor promo. The only option that isn’t an option was to return phone in 3 days but the phone installment plan had already been charged and AppleCare added to phone which Walmart refused to deal with. I’m glad that this company thinks it doesn’t need my business as I used to spend $100/week there and my wife spent $100/ month on online clothes for our foster baby. So Walmart has walked away from $6,000/yr to refuse a promo that they said I was getting.

Walmart,"Walmart,... Ironically after shopping here you leave feeling like you want to hit your head up against the wall,.. Hence the name, ""WALMART""...","Walmart,... Huge corporation with such a minimal point classification,.. Perhaps this is one of the key factors behind their lack of interest in customer service.. I assume given their magnitude in terms of their economical status they don't bother with consumer reviews, whether positive or negative..Which is unfortunate given the importance of customer satisfaction in every aspect.It's not just about providing the consumer with affordable pricing, it's also about providing good customer service in every aspect,.. Such as customer relations, technical, etc.As a consumer I am aware that there's no such thing as perfect service, there might be situations were the sales associate is not fully aware of certain items, or store policies,.. However if the associates manifest that they're forthcoming in providing the best service, by inquiring, researching, possessing good communication skills, etc..With this it would make a world of difference, improving the quality of service tremendously.Despite the lack of product quality by manufacturer,.. In addition, the associates in the customer service area with their return policy issues,Perhaps most of us would appreciate for the policy to be Modified a bit, but once again this could be bypassed without any inconvenience if and whenThe customer service Rep would simply be courteous, professional, positive demeanor, etc... etc.... As a result the consumer would then convert into a client.I've shopped at the calexico store several times, honestly the quality of service is sort of divided... Some associates were very courteous and other'sLeft a lot to be desired for!But if I had to rate the overall experience my rating at this particular store would be poor!Thanks",0,1

Walmart,DON'T WORK FOR WALMART,"Working at Wal-Mart was the worst job I've ever had. The store managers (at least at the store I worked at) didn't do anything other than threaten to fire me multiple times for doing my job. I should clarify, when I started I was told by a manager that unloading the truck, and doing break packs was done specific way, I followed directions and was praised by that specific manager for getting my work not only DONE, but done correctly and before schedule, however about a month into working there another Manager told me I was doing everything wrong, and that I would be fired if I didn't do it correctly. When I informed them that ""so and so"" said that the way I was doing it was correct, and that ""so and so"" was the one who trained me on how to do it, they flipped out and basically threatened me yet again that if I talked back to them i'd lose my job.About a month later someone joined the team and was doing fine, but then the pressure that the managers gave was too much and they quick not even 2 weeks into the job. On my third month I was honestly starting to give up as well, I was enjoying the job, but the managers ALWAYS threatened me and other co-workers out of our jobs if the truck (even if it was a two truck night) wasn't done by 5pm we'd get fired, or that there would be consequences.About 4 months in I put in my two week notice, in which on my last day I had about 5-7 other co-workers tell me that they're going to try and find another job because the way they've been treated isn't right, and that because I was leaving I gave them that push to leave. People that have been working there for years, left because of the stuff their managers did finally got to them.So unless you want to work at a place that pays you 11.00 USD an hour, but slowly takes away your mental health, and your co-workers mental health I'd advice you to please go look somewhere else. Because a Toxic work environment for a company that punishes it's workers for taking time off for family deaths, or personal health related issues, is NOT a company to look forward to.",0,1

Sounds easy enough right? NOT IN THE LEAST BIT! I spent the whole day making 5 calls and 4 store trips because NOBODY that works at Walmart seems to know the correct way to return the item. I am told on the phone just take it to Walmart and they will return it. The lady at customer service says it can not be returned to store!

I call back they say take it to FedEx. Now this is 8 hours later from when I placed the call. Obviously I'm a little wore thin fr the run around! So I call and ask for supervisor and say look I just want to return this item and re order the one I need. I order it from Walmart.com how come I can't just return it to store and order the right one? They say it's from a 3rd party retailer thru them! Why would the company give me a refund until they get their item first? Ok now you are allowing them to sell thru your name! You (A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY) have possession of the item. You see it's the right item, you scan the item serial number and see it matches! You can't just pay me the $200 the item costs til u ship the item back to (Obviously a trusted vendor I'd believe if you are allowing them to sell their merchandise on your website) and I would have saved a whole day off work and about $30 in gas running back and forth! That's not worth one of your customers business and time? I WILL NOT BE SHOPPING AT WALMART.COM AGAIN. THE $20 I SAVED IS NOT WORTH THE WHOLE DAY RUN AROUND AND THE $30 IN GAS.

The smug supervisor (Macey) that I had them call after 30 minutes of a electronics specialist having no clue how to verify the price of a laptop was the worst customer care I have ever seen. They had 2 laptops mounted to a display with 2 prices one was $199 and the other $549 after spending about another half hour wating for him and two others to sort out whats what I was very irritated. So I told him I felt they should honor the price they CLEARLY had on display for one of those two laptops. No apologies and a solid ""im im not gonna do that"" is all I got from him. At that point I told him thats not right that I have wasted a hour of my time for your stores mistake and you wont honor the price displayed. That is false advertisement. I asked isnt there something you can do. His reply was "" I can fix the take but I'm not giving you a $500 laptop for $200. His attitude was clearly meant to make me feel stupid and I left the store in a walk of shame because I couldn't afford $500. It was humiliating and I will be calling corperate.

Walmart,Walmart location:Store 1192 Walmart Card pushers,"Walmart location:Store 1192Address: 610 Sixth St. New Westminster BCV3L3C2OP#000463 TE#01 Time: 11:00 (approximately)date: Feb/12/2020The east Indian clerk even though there was a line up chose to delay the rest of the customers by selling Walmart credit card to another customer, therefore blocking the line up. When asked to skip the credit card sales, she said she's just doing her job. How can Walmart permit such lack of consideration? Why can't she just not close the till to complete her sale? Within hearing distance, she told the customer that if he applies for Walmart credit card, he will get some discount. She did not say she will get her commission. So she said, she's just doing her job? Doing her job means serving everyone on a line up. She said that if I'm in a hurry to go somewhere else !!!!

Walmart,Never ever order through Wal-Mart.com,Never ever order through Wal-Mart.comI noticed extra charges on my credit cardsWhen I checked my Wal-Mart acct there were other people’s orders on my accountAnd my credit cards were charged for other people’s items. I reported it to their fraud dept and the charges were put back on my credit card acct. I then had to cancel 2 of my credit cards and filed police report . It gets better on 9/16 I purchased a total of 3 e-gift cards as Christmas gifts for my grand sons they tried to use them and the message said they had already been used. I’m fuming and this point. I spoke with a mgr in the gift card dept she called me a liar that I used the gift cards and refused to put the dollar amounts on the gift cards or replace them . I’m out $108.00.Wal-Mart has very dishonest people working for them and a mgr that refuses to fix my e-gift cards that THEY used.,0,1

Walmart,CUSTOMER BEWARE...,CUSTOMER BEWARE.... First let me start this review off by saying that I am very competent individual and I completely understand the return policy but when you sell someone something that is invalid and refuses to even give them a Walmart gift card in return that is stealing. When I purchase a phone card online which I received through email and go to enter the pin number and it's an invalid pin number and I call Walmart com customers services and they give me a website go on which had the same invalid pin that I was emailed the first time so I call back at which is time I am told that they cannot refund the gift card and that I need to call my bank to stop charges on my account.

I playfully explained i usually grab thousands of empty gift cards and fill em later. Well apparently she wasnt pleased with my type humor. So she filled my card for ne and i told my daugbter i would pick up a couple grocery items i had forgotten. Well as i was walking through the grocery aisles the lady store manager along with 4 ither people approached me and began questioning me as to why i had brought empty gift card and told the cashier i had brought in thousands before. I explained i was being goofy. She said im not allowed to do that and that she was gonna call the police on me. She argued with me right then and there and again threatened to call the police.

Walmart,Every year at Christmas time I always…,"Every year at Christmas time I always give out Walmart gift cards since everybody I know does shopping at Walmart it's the perfect gift, or that used to be the case. This last Christmas I bought gift cards for All My Children *which I have seven children total plus three grandkids) my children recently told me they've had nothing but problems trying to use their gift cards therefore, I gave them the cash and they gave me the gift cards I figured somehow I would get them to work. I called ahead to make sure the money was still on the gift cards prior to going in and doing my shopping when I got to the register to use my gift cards the machine would not take them two different cashiers tried helping with the transactions they went on to tell me that I'm not the only person that has had this issue and they don't even know why Walmart sells gift cards anymore because they're nothing but a problem. So let this be known to everybody out there DO NOT PURCHASE WALMART GIFT CARDS!!!!!! Gi ve out cash because the cards are no good , they may say the money is on there for the balance but when you try to use them you cannot use them and the cashiers are very rude about it that act like you're wasting their time. This is discouraging because over the past at least 10 years I've been purchasing Walmart gift cards and I'm very disappointed to hear that this has become a problem as a person who shops at Walmart three to five times a week because it is across the street from my job it has really made me think about spending my money elsewhere. I am a manager at a restaurant if I treated my customers this way I would not expect them to return! I have over $100 in gift cards that I cannot use!!! Very discouraged customer",0,1

Walmart,WALMART.COM PICK UP AT STORE IS WORTHLESS!!,I ordered online for pick up in store and it was the worst experience ever. Placed order on Sunday Feb. 2nd around 4 and it said would be ready by 8. At 7pm I received email that couldnt be picked up until Feb. 5th. I then attempted to cancel order as I need items before then. I requested cancellation expecting for it to process for refund. Then I received an email that the order would now be available for pick up on Feb. 6th and thought slmethings wrong because I cancelled this was Feb. 4th. I had chatted online on the 2nd to make sure I had cancelled and they assured me that everything was fine and offered a 10 code for shopping online again. When I received the email on the 4th I called and told them something was wrong because I had cancelled and they said no worries. The money had not been credited nor was I emailed that refund was processing on the 5th and called and someone manually got it into process for refund but they were stupid and only processed one item not both. I noticed this and called again and informed them that they didnt process for both items and after arguing with them they supposedly put into process for refund on 2nd item. Which I have not received email confirming this as of Feb. 7. So I called again and asked for where to file a complaint was given same number and I went through this 3 different times with 3 different customer service reps and finally was transferred to talk to someone that finally gave me an address to file a formal complaint. Mind you this order was for only 14 something but walmart would have not refunded unless I had done all of this. Walmart com can take your money in two seconds but you have to jump through hoops to get money back when it was their fault because they said the items were available for pick up but were not which is what pushed for cancellation. Most ridiculous unethical business practices. I am boycotting Walmart period because I ordered online to avoid going to store because experience is always horrible in store. Never enough cashiers checking out your own groceries. Walmart associates that cant tell you where to find anything. Walmart has outgrown its britches. I will travel way out of my way to not shop there ever again. Walmart you really need to stick by the principles you say you stand for.

I should mention that the rest of the people in line were elderly and/or disabled. When I inquired as to the possibility of opening an additional check stand, I was told it was a manager decision and they could not contact the manager unless there was a checkout problem! When I said ,""there's about to be one (a problem),"" I was ignored and told to use the self check stand or wait. I had to wait for 20 minutes before I was finished. When I complained to another employee, I was told that ""The managers don't ever listen to what we have to say.""

Walmart,Walmart.com and their Marketplace Sellers,"Walmart is a joke. They're a big store that doesn't actually care about their customers. They are so huge that they just let the customer be disappointed and don't even try to fix it. They don't listen to the customer when the customer contacts customer ""service"". They leave NOT EVEN half-assed voice mails that you cannot understand a word of. They cancel your orders and lie and say the item was damaged in transit. Then they don't even try to replace the item they just refund you and even screw THAT UP. I ordered a shelf from AMI Ventures Inc through Walmart.com. The shelf was cheap and I think they screwed the price up. So then because they obviously screwed up, they lied and said the shelf was damaged in transit. Oh, and get this. IT WAS THE LAST ONE IN STOCK. So I asked if they could just send me the same shelf in a different color. Because those were in stock on the site. AMI Ventures Inc sends me an email, which was as grammatically incorrect as it gets by the way, saying there's nothing more they can do and they've refunded me. Then I get an email from Walmart saying my item had been shipped and there was a price adjustment. So I'm here thinking they shipped it. I email them to check and Walmart says it's been refunded. So then why does it say that I have been charged $1.18 if I've been refunded? It's amazing that a company has so many employees and they can't fix something this small. Confused reading this review? Imagine my confusion from the 10 different employees I've spoken to so far and none of them have even remotely tried to actually fix anything or help. Customer ""care"" is a joke. Avoid Walmart if you can.",0,1

Despite my frustrations they get a star for reimbursing my money back. Unfortunately Amazon is and will always be a far superior company and provide highest customer service levels and overall experience compared to shopping online at Walmart.",0,1

Walmart,Utterly terrible experience with…,"Utterly terrible experience with Walmart online. I make a lot of online purchases but this is the first and last with Walmart. They simply do not stand behind their customers. After multiple phone calls and multiple promises from Walmart, I am still without the item I ordered and am basically told to deal with the vendor directly who is not responsive. At the time of purchase, I was not aware that Walmart simply provides a portal for companies to sell to Canadians and they do not do anything to protect their customers from unscrupulous or fraudulent vendors. Shame on Walmart,",0,1
Walmart,Rude employees,"Stood in line behind one lady at Walmart on Calumet street in Appleton, WI electronics desk. She was on her phone looking things up & talking with her husband, figuring out what she wanted while the service guy behind the desk totally ignored me, the lady asked if he wanted to wait on me and he said ""no"" with a dirty look on his face. I was ok with waiting a few minutes. Finally after standing there patiently waiting for like 15 minutes (with 2 other workers standing there talking about their work schedules & personal life, not even knowing I was there) the service guy finally rudely asked ""what do you need"". I said I was there to pick up an I-phone that came in today, he said very rudely ""what phone, while walking in circles huffing and puffing, not even really looking"", ""you have to pick up online orders at the rectangle desk thing in the center by the checkouts"". It wasn't an online order, but he just assumed, so I left. So then, I called the other Walmart store near Casaloma street, I was transferred 4 different times back and forth, no one knew who to transfer me to. The service desk then transferred me to the electronics dept., No one answered 3 different times of transfers. It took about 20 minutes to reach the ""right"" person. She then had to go look for the phone (another 10 minutes), she said they had the phone in stock (the original place I bought it from, it was supposed to be sent to Calumet store) after looking for it for about 15 minutes, they said I could come get the phone. I told them 3 times I ordered it through the store, and not online, and wanted to make sure I could pick it up. No one asked me my name, or info. I drove the 15-20 min with traffic to the other side of town, talked to a guy at the desk who didn't know anything about it, and had to ask someone. Then waited for them another 15 minutes to look for the phone again, only to find out that it was a ""pick up item"" and the service desk was now closed. She had the exact phone in her hand but she couldn't give it to me unless I purchased the phone again then came back another time to refund the other (same exact phone). At this point, I no longer want to deal with it. Never again will I deal with Walmarts electronic service. I hope no one else ever receives this kind of treatment as a customer.",0,1
Walmart,Beware of Walmart.com,"I ordered a bath pillow from Walmart.com. It was $19.99; the pillow I received was not the brand or pillow and cost $8. I called and they said I needed to contact the company that manufactures it, as they don’t correct any problem with someone else’s products even though I bought it on their website. I contacted other company by email. I sent them a picture and order# of the pillow I ordered and what was mistakenly sent. They sent the exact wrong one again. I called and explained to customer service, they told me to take it back to nearest store for a credit. When I did, they said no that I needed to contact the other company. I was so mad...they refused to listen. Finally one of the girls said if I would buy a box to ship it back she would start a refund credit. I had the pkg it came in but they insisted I had to buy a box. I am DONE with Walmart. Another associate found a box and shipped it. I am still waiting on my credit.

Walmart,Undelivered merchandise.,"Below is a copy of one of the threads of conversation with Walmart Customer Service. I placed an order via their website for a Christmas present. I requested that they be delivered to my office to avoid porch pirates. The package was sent via FedEx. We receive deliveries everyday from FedEx. On this day we had a new driver and after receiving accepted the shipment the driver stated that he could not find all of the packages due to Christmas volume and would return once he had unloaded more. He never returned. Walmart and FedEx have both rejected my appeals. I suggest that you order anything via the Walmart website at your own peril.

It didn’t show up so I called the next day and they said it looks like it was lost in transit and they would re-ship the item no need to return anything. I took that as if you get the original don’t worry about sending it back. It ended up showing up. Now after 2 months I just received an email that they will be charging my credit card if I don’t contact them and have it picked up within 5 days. After calling and being on hold for 40 minutes they told me that I have to return the item and they never told me to keep it. They will get me a call tag or have fedex pick it up because I’m not sitting here all day waiting for them to show up because I have to work. So now I have to drop it off at FedEx that is 20 minutes away. What was the point to shop online! At least I’m lucky and didn’t trust them to let me keep it and it is still in they box.,0,1

Walmart,THEY STEAL FROM YOU BY NOT GIVING YOU WHAT YOU ORDER,"I have used Walmarts on line grocery pickup for several months now but I think I am done! On 4 different occasions I have had numerous items that were not included when I picked them up. The store did not include them even though I was charged for them. When I call them they make excuses and then require me to drive 20 miles back to the store to get the items they forgot to include. This last time I asked them to just refund my money. I was told this would take 5-7 business days to get the money back. Upon calling the corporate offices I was told the refund was never started! They are stealing from me! How many times did I miss something that they didn't put in my groceries? This store at 5200 E 60th ST North in Sioux Falls SD is the worst. They are stealing from us on the online grocery app. Its not that things were out of stock they just did not include them with my order. So make sure if you use this store for grocery pickup that you look over the entire list before you leave the store. And if something is missing just call corporate because up there on the north end of sioux falls you will be ripped off. And then they will lie right to your face and tell you a refund is on the way when in fact it is not. I told them I would take a lie detecor test because I am not a liar or a theif but they are. I am sick and tired of the poor customer service that Walmart gives you while stealing from you at the same time. DO NOT USE THE ONLINE GROCERY APP.

Walmart,Their policies are starting to resemble…,"Their policies are starting to resemble scam tactics. Ordered an electric shovel from them because I figured, ""oh it's Walmart if anything goes wrong I'll be covered."" WRONG. First of all their decision to start using LaserShip after the terrible reputation it has and how many billions of dollars this company makes is just ridiculous. Well LaserShip lived up to their rep, and my package went missing. Called customer service and they made it seem like it was no problem and issued me a replacement. They never mentioned that if the other package showed up I would have to return it or be charged for it OR I WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED THE REPLACEMENT. The missing package finally did show up more than a week later and was left down by my car for days where anyone could have taken it. It was also left out in the cold which would probably ruin the battery of this particular item. Now almost two months later I get an email that if I don't return it they will charge me for it. Just spent almost an hour of my time talking to a customer representative and a manager, Jonathan, and all they could offer me was to let the charge go through and then I have to call them to get it refunded and then they will send me a label for the package to be sent back. However originally they were going to try to get me to bring it back to a Walmart store. I had to argue with them to get them to pick it up and then for some reason I need to be charged first? Told them both I would not be doing business with Walmart anymore but of course they don't care, because this company makes so much money that it doesn't care about its customers anymore, because it doesn't need to. If you decide to continue to do business with walmart.com just be wary of any kind of replacement situation.

First, they are tied into the system my doctor uses so when my doctor prescribes a medication, the order goes directly from my doctor's computer system to my local Walmart without me having to call in the order. Then, when the medication is ready I receive either a phone call or text message telling me the prescription is ready for pickup. Walmart then knows when the medication is about to run out and sends me a test message offering to automatically renew the prescription, The process then starts again with the pharmacy automatically filling the order, and again notifying me via test message when it is ready. Super nice system.",0,5

They are not perfect and I don’t expect any company to be. Just about every time I spend money at Walmart, I never regret it. I love supporting other local grocery stores but Walmart has won my heart for life. 7/5 stars- Joey Jilovec (Arizona)",0,5

Walmart,The Best Choice mini portable…,The Best Choice mini portable washer/spinner machine works great except I'm very unhappy with the overall performance due to the fact that this item DOES NOT have a pump in it to pump the water out 🤔 I had to lift the washer full of water up to the side of my bathtub so that it could drain the water out. Why is there a drain setting on the dial if there is NO pump? So disappointed in this product. I'm almost 60 yrs old and it's too hard on me to have to lift this machine everytime I need to drain the water...I'm an Unhappy CUSTOMER!!!,0,2
Walmart,My experience with shopping at Walmart…,"My experience with shopping at Walmart online hasn't been terrible, but the 2-day shipping CANNOT be relied on. Nothing I have ever ordered with 2-day shipping has ever shown up on time and I order online quite often. Normally the supposed 2-day items show up within 4 to 7 days. Not nearly as reliable as Amazon Prime. Everything always gets ""delayed"" through Walmart.",0,2

Walmart,First time online shopper experience,I received a gift card for Christmas so I ordered a 7 in 1 cooker. Said it would take a week. Well the day came for its arrival. 20 mi nutes before I was to pick it up. I got a email that said dont go to store yet it's been delayed. So I called customer service and they said my item had arrived at the store at 10;36 am and gave me the name of who signed for it. So I asked when can I come get it? Well hours go by and no message. I called once more before I went to bed that night thinking well for sure by the morning. Nope nothing. Customer service ca)led the store and could not talk to anyone. they never answered their phone so I was told go to the store and talk to customer service. So I arrive and the person behind the counter asks me to step aside because they knew I was upset. The MOD came over to help still nothing noone knew a thing as to where my package was. Mind you I was told it was signed for by someone in the store. After about a hour of trying to figure this out I said look I'll get a cooker off the shelf and you can give me a refund. So I go to get another cooker and go to the counter and was told you have to call customer service online to get a refund. I was livid. I did get a refund part on my card and part gift card. But I usually shop on Amazon and now I will continue to shop there. Walmart you lost my business.,0,1

Walmart,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON WORTHLESS TIRES AND WARRANTY,I will never ever order tires from Walmart.com ever again. Or will I bother to get the road hazard warranty because its bologna especially when I'm paying my hard earned money for tires and warranty to get a $5 dollar and some change discount off my purchase. I am applaud that is so unprofessional and just wrong. I feel if I order it online and get it put on at your facility you such honor my wishes as a customer and send me a replacement tire. It came from your warehouse. I couldn't purchase it in the store. Because they don't carry my size in the store. Therefore I have to order my tires. I never felt so frustrated.,0,1

Walmart,Fallon Walmart Sucks,"We ordered the online service today for Walmart in fallon Nevada, that was a complete joke. After trying to sign in on the kiosk, I waited nearly an hour for the associate that was supposed to be coming soon. So a manager and a costumer support person comes up to me, they ask for my order number, and tell me the order doesn’t exist. I show them the confirmation email as well as the order being ready on their app and they tell me those are the wrong documents. After this the manager tells me that I’m at the wrong place, there is a 10 foot sign that says online grocery pick up right next to the kiosk. I say this to the manager and he says “can’t you see that’s just advertisements!” I hate that we live in such a rural area and Fallon is the only Walmart within 100 miles or we would go elsewhere. Hate this damn store and it’s garbage employees.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart Mishandles a Credit Card Purchase,"On 11/14 , contrary to 9+ years of using Credit Cards at Walmart and an Oct purchase at this store- 301 San Mateo SE, Albuquerque, 87106 , I was told by Cashier Alexis(?) and Supervisor Gracie that it was "" Walmart Policy"" to require Id for a Credit Card purchase. (Mastercard and Visa require their signed Credit Cards be accepted without ID.) I found no signs about this ""Walmart Policy"" nor anything at the Walmart website. After emailing Walmart, I received Unsigned emails from Walmart Executive Escalations which Did Not Explain this ""Walmart Policy"". ( These emails asked for my name, which Walmart had and Inconsistently were Unsigned ! They also became Spam with Walmart promoting itself.) I then emailed Walmart Chief Executive Officer, Doug McMillon, requesting he explain ""Walmart Policy"" on requiring Id for my signed Mastercard CACSEE NMI Incident 191123... Mr. McMillon Did not Respond!!! I contrast the Poor, Unresponsiveness of Walmart with Mastercard, who when emailed, confirmed that they require a Signed Mastercard be accepted Without Additional Id.",0,1

I have never been so disgusted by a backup software provider in my life I went through a hurricane of a category five, had no running water for six weeks, no sewage available for six weeks, power was almost 2 months out, we cannot drive because trees were down, we had a dawn to dusk curfew and if we were caught outside after that we were going to jail, we were treated as if we were in jail ourselves all because of an event that was beyond our control. After all that everything in our lives was almost to back to what we call normal. Bam the gift that keeps giving kinda like Apple with the 24 hour, 5 days and 13 days of recovery! 18 months later we found out the house we bought two weeks before the storm has a mold problem and it’s out of control so 85% of the outer walls in our home has to be demoed as well as the garage and attic! That’s not counting the fees,the cost and deductibles and blah blah blah. What I’m getting at is Apple is by far the worst situation than I’ve ever been in. My account got hacked and I have yet to be able to get in my account since 3rd January. I was told after 24 hours I would be able to access it. 24 hours is up and that went to five days and was told “I will be able to access it” Five days is up and guess what now it’s 13 days!!! Guess what I’m not waiting the 13 days you can take my ID all of my information, the pictures of my life(engagement, wedding etc), my children’s lives (births, birthdays, special moments), my deceased mother and father and shove them up where the sun don’t shine!

I go there the next morning and l nothing was available. I ask 1 of the other employees to check, then he tells me they have 12 on order for Monday. Not sure how qualified most of these characters are, but they sure aren't reliable or not competent. Some of them should be given jobs like mopping floors I stead oft being put to do certain jobs.

The delivery made on a date different from the original order specific date plus the ineffective and incompetent handling by customer service is very unbussniss like, and will create problems in the future.

The fact that not even a predesigignated delivery date could be honored and customer service representatives making no attempt to mitigate the situation, marks a serious low for this company!",0,1

The pickup was under my name. Before picking up the item I called to ensure it was there (walmart.com 800 number) before going & was told it was. I called because the tracking info online says different info than the 800 number. When I arrived & provided my order number, was told it was in route not in the store yet but will check in the back to double check. The mngr walked up while the person was checking & I explained I was told it was there. She stated alot of pkgs were lost & there just telling people whatever. Meanwhile the mgnr stated we have the item instore but it doesn't include everything that was in the bundle pkg. Why would I take something less than what was ordered? Being a little frustrated after that, I left & called the 800 number again & was told the pkg wasn't lost but will take longer to get, my question was how long (not sure but call back on Monday if no update) It was offered to cancel with a full refund but this was a gift to me & a bundle deal. I'm super frustrated on this online experience & will never order online from Walmart.com again!!",0,1

But lately I have been having unpleasant online shopping experiences and when I call corporate, I have been assisted by some really rude customer service reps. I was always taught don't let your personal life interfere with your work life and you should check your attitude at the door, I understand that some people are not morning people if that's the case get a new job on switch schedule what might not see it important to you and just might be very important to the next person.

The item shown was NOT what they sent me. In short it was less than HALF the amount than what was pictured (93g instead of 205g). After a TON of back and forth the third party finally agreed to at least pay for the return shipping but all the hassle was left to me.

Walmart,FedEx is a NIGHTMARE,"Walmarts only shipping carrier is the dreaded FedEx. Literally the worst company I've ever had to deal with and packages NEVER arrive on time. Instead, you could be waiting weeks just because they're lazy and keep packages on trucks for weeks at a time, OR they will keep marking your package as unable to be delivered because of the weather, when in fact there will be absolutely nothing going on. At least in one particular location, Rensselaer NY is notorious for terrible and unpredictable service. I actually like shopping Walmart.com, but because of their poor choice to partner with FedEx, I am now switching over to Amazon permanently. I've had far too many issues with FedEx to continue ordering from Walmart. If they drop FedEx, I'll be back, but until then, I'm boycotting them both!",0,2

I asked why since there were other vehicles parking everywhere and I was the only target. He stated it's because I was sitting outside and there's been complaining about crashing widows and such. I gave him my ID and it was cleared within a few minutes. I thought after checking my ID he would continue on to other vehicles, but he came straight for me and then left. I went inside and asked the staff if there's been window crashing. He said no. I think someone at Walmart reported me. THIS Walmart has cameras at the parking lot.

Walmart,Teenage bandits damaging store products,"My rating is based on the poor policies for handling constant product damage done by a gang of teenagers at the Taylor Pa. Wal-Mart. For the last three times I have visited this store, this gang has caused trouble with intentional damage to products and potential injuries to employees and customers by sweeping product onto the floor. Today they were setting off party confetti into walkways causing a slip hazard. When I confronted an employee their response was, ""our security escorted them out"". Last week they were starting fights with each other. When the hell is Wal-Mart going to take responsibility for their actions. If an employee or customer fell and was injured it would be devastating to them and their family, in addition it could be the result of a lawsuit or in the news papers at a minimum. But most of all, (if) your neglectful policies (or (if) failure to follow) contributes to the criminal activity by these teenage bandits it is considered shameful at a minimun. Hear me loud and clear, I love Wal-Mart stores, especially the Taylor Store and in fact I pass three Wal-Mart Stores on my way to Taylor....I live 25 miles away. I'm appalled that Corporate Managers in Wal-Mart can drive their business into a retail giant, but can't help the community to rid this criminal activity. By escorting these bandits out the door will only encourage them to go elsewhere to perform their crime. Their parents have the full responsibility here, but they don't have eyes in Wal-Mart or any other stores. If there is any suggestion for me to help, please respond to my review, because there is more you can do.",0,1

Get an email after purchasing said idea and they say your order is out of stock will get more in in a week. Call customer service to get a refund and after a half hour of trying to understand the lady that clearly couldn't not speak English I tried to have her transfer me to someone I could understand with no luck. Now here I am out of the cash I spent and not to mention didn't get any product in return. Needless to say really poor service all the way around.,0,1

Walmart,Just wrong in so many ways,I was in line at my local Walmart trying to use my Walmart pay. I kept getting a error code telling me to check my emails. I look quick at the register to find out my account has been suspended for to many returns. Walmart has blocked me from all my receipts of past purchases. I can not get my medication refills or get any history of medication from the past also they suspended my Walmart pay so I couldn’t finish my transaction. When I contacted them I was told because I returned to many things so my account has been suspended for life even though I was with in there return policy. I don’t know how they can get away with that after a purchase the recipes are my property even if they are electronic and is on there site. But blocking me from my life dependent medication that they have been issuing me for the past 4 years is unacceptable and ridiculous. With out any heads up or telling me there is any type of issue with my account. I called and explained it’s Christmas time I had a few more returns then usual because things changed in life but that was no help. All the agents agree with me but they couldn’t help it’s a corporate decision that I keep getting the run around with. Contacted the BBB and local news for help on this. If Walmart doesn’t want to talk to me maybe they will have better luck. I will be posting my story everywhere for people not to trust Walmart especially with medication or receipts.,0,1

Walmart,Dont shop walmart.com,"I purchased a freezer from walmart.com. It arrived a week later than the one week asigned delivery date. When it came it was badly dented. We were two weeks into it at this point. I scheduled a pickup and exchange. After waiting almost two more weeks for that to happen, the replacement was even more damaged than the first one. Now we are four weeks into it and they have said only one exchange per item. They now say that a pickup and refund will happen within the next week. That puts at 5 weeks if it actually happens when its supposed to. I would assume it will follow suit and be a week past due which will put us at 6 weeks out and starting all over looking for a new freezer. Thanks for being a colossal waste of my time walmart.com!

Walmart,For the third time in 11 months I have…,"For the third time in 11 months I have observed the security guard(s) at the Perkins Road location in Stillwater, Oklahoma harass their customers. In each of these encounters, I have witnessed textbook examples of a proud and glib individual (i.e. Wal-Mart security) wield the thinnest of power and influence over normal, every day ‘’Joes.’’ Or, stated another way, the security team at the Stillwater, Oklahoma Wal-Mart should be embarrassed, ashamed, and apologetic of their behavior. Or yet another way to put it is that a very small, insecure, pathetic twentysomething male got his rocks off by outright bothering people who—guessing by the of their car-full of items—had just spent about two hundred bucks at the Stillwater Wal-Mart. It’s weird, 25 years ago—when I worked in the frozen food section at this very same location—I felt sorry for the store’s security guards because they had to thanklessly toil through their days as they tried to stop tricky, shifty shoplifters from stealing. Over the years it’s been obvious to me that Wal-Mart security guards are less respectful and, more importantly, less impactful. Seriously, Wal-Mart should reassess the fiscal value their security teams bring to any respective store. I’m quite sure that, on occasion, a random theft has been thwarted and eve brought to justice. However, my recent experiences leave me no choice but to write this and to implore any one that might care to, please, please, reconsider your shopping at the Stillwater, Oklahoma Wal-Marts. To be more specific, the first instance of harassment that I saw occurred about 11 months ago. A close friend of mine purchased an item in electronics at about 1:00 am. When we walked to the store’s main entrance/exit three people stopped my friend because he didn’t have a receipt. The reason he didn’t have a receipt is that the original sales associate in electronics had not provided my friend with a receipt. To make matters worse, after my friend’s purchase the sales associate from electronics had gone on his lunch break so he couldn’t vouch for us either. My friend was quite polite the entire time, despite me telling him we should go. After all, he HAD paid so the item was his. At that juncture, Wal-Mart had no business nor did they have a right to ask for a receipt. The item belonged to him. Is Wal-Mart also allowed to ask for receipts for the clothes in your back or for the things in your pockets? I was irate but my friend patiently endured the 40-minute detainment until the matter could be cleared. The second time I witnessed problems with Wal-Mart security was back in August 2019. I was in the self-checkout lines and, again, three different guards and/or managers had accused a customer of stealing. The customer, a sandy-haired blonde woman in her 20s, had made multiple purchases at the self checkout counter. Apparently Wal-Mart’s staff had no interest in ensuring whether or not a crime had been committed before they’d accused the woman of a crime. The lady kept saying, ‘’I bought it. I paid. I’ve paid for everything.’’ But, nonetheless, the intrusive and invasive Wal-Mart employees dug through the woman’s bags. They removed all her items and counted them as they referenced her receipts along the way. After about seven or eight minutes one of the managers muttered a half-hearted ‘’sorry for the inconvenience, ma’am,’’ and then beckoned her to leave. Finally, just yesterday I saw a security guard harassing three or four junior high girls (they were loosely chaperoned by one of the girls’ parents). The girls were in tears and clearly had done nothing wrong because, after all, if they had done something wrong then the local police would have been on their way. The Wal-Mart security guard said he’d followed the girls around and that they had carried some item around the store and, GASP, had put the item back on a rack? When I walked by this particular conversation by the exit doors, it was obvious that the guard had nothing ‘’on’’ these young women. Otherwise the conversation wouldn't even be happening. If he had evidence against them then SPD would be on the way. Instead, the ridiculous (small) man stopped these teenagers just to beat his chest and try to make the girls feel scared and small. One girl just kept crying ''I just came for starbursts.'' It was disgusting. Anyone with an IQ over 75 would have recognize the man’s wrong doing. Anyone with a bit of sympathy and empathy would have recognized the man just wanted to feel big for three minutes. He should be ashamed and fired. The event occurred about 11:30 pm on Saturday, December 28th. At the end of the interrogation the so-called ‘’security guard’’ just said, ''Okay. If I hear you did something this lady [pointing at the mother] shops here all the time.'' The ladies shuffled away and I told him he was ‘’a piece of sh**’’ then he replied that I should move along or he’d call the police. I told him what he did was wrong and that I was going to formally complain to corporate. His response was to call the local police on me—or at least to pretend he was. I walked away assuring him of my intention to file a grievance against him. I do hope Wal-Mart recognizes that the security guard at their Stillwater, Oklahoma location gives the company a bad name. He makes them weak. He frightens, intimidates, and humiliates paying customers. Um, in what business model is this a viable behavior? On what planet is this a legitimate practice? Grow up dude. Do better Wal-Mart. In the meantime, I do hope those in Stillwater will reconsider spending their money at such an unstable, unsafe establishment.",0,1

This was supposed to be a new game and the game console is telling me it is a DVD, format not compatible, that cannot be read as in FAKE DISC! The game was loosely wrapped with taped plastic when I bought it but the point is- it was wrapped like a new game. Had it been unwrapped or said used I would have never purchased the game, because I would have known it was returned, and I wanted a new product. I contact Walmart and they tell me there's nothing they can do. No refund or exchange will be given. The customer service representative goes on to say that it sounds like a manufacturer problem and I have to contact the Xbox Corporation. All I want is an exchange or my money back.

Walmart,Horrible service-,"Ordered a camera that was in stock at my local Walmart at 10pm (it would be ready for pickup the next day after 12pm- which it was since again it was an in stock item). Went online at 7am- 9 hours after placing my order to find that the camera was priced $50.00 lower. Called the store and explained the situation and asked about how I could get a price adjustment, since I just placed the order and it wasn’t even ready for pickup. I was told that once it’s ready for pickup, come to the store, pick it up, and go to customer service for the adjustment. I do exactly what I was instructed, to have customer service tell me that they couldn’t give me the adjustment since I ordered online. What? It was an item that was in the store- but whatever. She told me to call 800-Walmart and they would be able to give me the adjustment. I went to my car, called 800-Walmart, got through the prompts to talk to someone to have my call picked up with no one on the other end- just lots of talking in the background. Okay, fine, I hang up and call again and got someone on the other end of the line. I explain my situation and asked for the adjustment. She asked me “So, why do you think Walmart should give you a price adjustment?”. I explained that before the camera was even ready for pickup, it was $50.00 less. She put me on hold for a few minutes, then came back to tell me that Walmart would not give me the adjustment since I purchased it at the higher price, and I had picked it up. Really??? I then asked if I was able to return it to the store, and then re-purchase it (I’m still in the parking lot, and the camera is still in the bag). She puts me on hold, comes back and reiterated that Walmart would not give me the price adjustment, but she would send a promo code for $10.00 off of my next purchase of $15.00 or more. I asked again about returning and re-purchasing the camera. She said I could- okay, fine. I go back in the store, back to customer service, and explain what I was told. The customer service representative immediately got a supervisor over to help- then returned the camera, and then tells me that I can’t re-purchase the same one because I ordered it online and it had to go through online returns- whatever that means. She sends me back to electronics to buy the exact type of camera that I just returned. The customer service in electronics was way more customer service oriented, and did the price match for Walmart.com with no problem. Walmart does not seem to care about providing a very customer friendly environment to its customers. I shop Kohl’s.com, Amazon, Target, and Sears.com on a regular basis, and I really believe that this is the absolute worst customer service I have received.

The manager sent a 25 dollar gift cert to my email which will never matter because I will never use them again. Normally I wouldn't even worry dealing with Walmart. Normally they would make things right but they could really not care less. They have truly done nothing at all to help other then lie about my stuff coming. Years ago this would be unacceptable but now things have definitely changed. Please don't take me wrong. The purpose of this review is not to run down walmart. The purpose is to hopefully keep someone else from making my mistake and if it saves one person from repeating this its well worth it!",0,1

Called customer service for the 5th time explained the situation I was out $545.00 NO TV NO MORE MONEY LEFT FOR CHRISTMAS Spoke with a Supervisor got no where with him either!! I asked if I could just go to any other Walmart around the area to pick it up he said no I would have to order it I said I did for the second time and I still don’t have a TV!! By far the worst experience I have had with Walmart!! Not happy at all do not shop online with this company!!! You will regret it!!!,0,1
Walmart,Ordered an item to be picked up in…,"Ordered an item to be picked up in store on the 3rd. It was supposed to be ready on the 10th. Never got a pickup email, was told by customer service to go to the store because it should be there. Spent 30 minutes for them to tell me they have no idea where it is. Got a refund for it, but I got it on cyber monday, so even if I were to try again I would still be out money! Plus, I have to wait 5 days for the refund to hit my account! Never doing this again!",0,1
Walmart,Placed an order on the 8th with 2 day…no 2 day,"Placed an order on the 8th with 2 day delivery,got informed that 2 of the items are going to arrive on the 23rd and one item on the 18th,what happened to the 2day delivery? I received one item on the 17th and another one on the 19th,the item that was supposed to be here on the 18th finally arrived on the 21st. I do understand that everyone is busy with the holidays and delays can happen but they should not advertise the 2 day delivery service if they can’t do it.Big difference between 2days and 2 weeks.The items where not gifts so I did not had to worry about getting them shipped out in my packages,if that would have been the case I would’ve been very upset. I will not order from there website again and I will not fall for their 2 day delivery scam again.Better of to order it and have it sent to the store so you can go and pick it up,that usually works pretty well ,until they put a genius in charge to mess that on up too",0,1
Walmart,Walmart just made me mad.,Walmart just made me mad.. How do u sell me something that is out of stock when they told me it would be there yesterday. Then give me a code that I have to spend $45 to get $25 for the inconvenience. It didn't say OUT OF STOCK when I purchased it.. So why do I have to spend money to get money for the inconvenience n they still can't tell me when it will be here. This is crazy but they got my money n my son fontnite game chair for Christmas.. SMH somebody need to do there job better. I'm mad!,0,1

Walmart issued a replacement order on 12/10. Due to arrive 12/18. It is now 12/21 and there is still no dollhouse. Called customer sevice and they have ZERO actionable plans to ensure delivery by Christmas. I paid for a product close to one month ago and have yet to receive it. Oh! And a refund wont hit my bank account for 5 days! So using the money to buy it elsewhere before Christmas isn't even an option! Buyers beware!!! Use amazon!!",0,1
Walmart,Haha wish I would have read the reviews…,"Haha wish I would have read the reviews 1st. I tried online because I hate the stores. I started the meal ready programs to limit my time in stores, especially Walmart. All I ordered was laundry detergent pods, dryer sheets and scent boosters. The tracking split the order in 2 shipments and I only received 1 2 days after the original delivery date.I'm not going to bother calling about it. I'm just here to tell you online is the same as in the store just less customers. Lol How can a company be this bad geez.",0,1
Walmart,Absolutely unreliable and poor service! Never going to use it again!,"Absolutely pathetic service! I ordered something for holidays, which never arrived. I got a refund without any notice citing that I didn’t like the product, which is a lie!

I’m absolutely disgusted and probably will never order from Walmart.com again!",0,1

Walmart,NEVER again!,"Ordered mugs as Christmas gifts for grandparents on 12/7. Said they would arrive by 12/13, they never showed up. I called customer service they told me my order was stuck in processing and I needed to cancel my order and re-order then they would expedite my order. I re-ordered with a delivery date by 12/20. I called back to have the order expedited, the family Christmas was 12/14 and already ruined so the quicker the better, they had NO idea what I was talking about and said there was no such thing as expedited orders for picture mugs. The first person I spoke with gave me the wrong information and sent me on a TWO HOUR rabbit hole search trying to get the gifts ASAP. Well today is 12/20 and NO mugs were delivered. I called and again I was told my order was ‘stuck in processing’, my options were to cancel my order OR get a refund.... annoying because those are the same thing, not different options. And I still have no special picture mugs for grandparents gifts. I will NEVER order from Walmart.com again!! The customer service is scripted with no real help and makes the whole already disappointing experience more annoying.",0,1

Instantly came home and issued a refund. It has been 5 days. No $$$ back. I contact the circus show that runs customer service. The insurance for the TV was processed...but NOT the TV!

Spent hours on the phone with about 7 different people before they finally told me they weren’t shipping it. I could have bought the toy if I had known earlier but they never even bothered to contact me. So now days before Christmas I don’t have what I need and I can’t get it. Awful customer service and completely unorganized. I have never had these issues with Amazon and if they need to cancel an order they NOTIFY you in a timely manner.

Walmart,I placed orders with Walmart and Amazon…,I placed orders with Walmart and Amazon for ten items each. First two packages were from Amazon. Both orders were placed on 11/25/19. I went on Walmart web site and looked up my orders three of the ten items were shown as “Cancelled”. I attempted to reorder and they sowed either a different higher price or item. Was sold out. Did not experience any problems with Amazon. Walmart used Fed Ex on their package delivery. Two days turned into 6 days. Next was that 2 items were shipped to store. This was the most effective but you have to go to store to pickup.,0,1

They created a shipping label but never gave it to the carrier. I will not be getting it in time for Christmas. Walmart is HORRIBLE for promising that you'll get something by Christmas knowing full well that you won't. They do this just to get the order. Because they know if they told you it would arrive after Christmas you'd buy it from somewhere else. Never again Walmart. This is the 2nd time this happened. It's not a fluke....it's how they do business. Buyer beware.",0,1

It then took 2 days to find out that Walmart lost in inside their own wearhouse 5 days before. They said they could not get it to me for at least 8 days, even if they sent a new one, they would not ship it faster because they were not willing to incur the additional cost. Oh yea, I will also have to wait 5 days to get my money refunded. Customer satisfaction and caring about your customers are a thing of the past with Walmart.",0,1

When I called to try and resolve the situation they told me I would have to dispute the charges through my financial institute for a refund.

Walmart,Worse than the cable repair guy at delivery.,Walmart is terrible at their delivery service. I ordered my food from Walmart delivery at 11 a.m. this morning. I weighted almost 10 hours where my order. They said it was going to be here. Still not here. I then called Walmart and ask them why my order is not here and where is the guy delivering it like my phone said he was. The very rude customer service lady basically told me that there's nothing they could do it until tomorrow. There was nothing she was going to do for me she returned my delivery fee but now I have no groceries the whole thing was to cook a nice meal for my family so thank you Walmart for all your great help ang your great customer service. If you are thinking about using WalMart delivery service make sure you have nothing important you want to do that day. they are worse than the cable company.,0,1

I promptly called Wal-Mart customer service, to report the problem, and was told that they are NOT responsible for ANY lost, damaged or missing gift cards. They directed me to my financial institution for refund or replacement. I am baffled at why my financial institution would be accountable for Wal-Mart's mistake.

Walmart,What a nightmare ordered an item on…,What a nightmare ordered an item on 11/28 said i would have it by 12/10 then all I get is order delayed. I go to chat they say their is a problem with my order in the system and I should cancel it wait 48 hour and reorder. I ask will I get the same price and will it arrive by 12/25 they can't answer. I ask for a phone number to call. I get some guy on the phone telling me a system problem same advice tells me to cancel wait 48 hour and re order. I ask will I get the same price I get a no. I complain I do then get to get it at the same price. I ask about when will I get it he says 48 hours fine. I point out what a pain this process was and I never had some much work to resolve an issue with Amazon. This is also very true. He starts telling me how much Amazon sucks. Just what I need to hear. I ask for a supervisor. Bottom line the supervisor tells me that my item is back ordered and that my original order would come in before any new order. Well why was I not told that and why was I told to cancel my original order. He has no real answer other than that was the best answer the first person I spoke could give me but he was a supervisor and he could give me the real answer. What??????. Now I did get a promo code from the first guy and I used it to order the item again which the system say I will have it in 48 hours. I did not cancel the first one so I can't wait to see which comes in first. Bottom line they have no process and any answer you get you can't trust. This equals Bad Business.,0,1

I was counting on that dvd for a Christmas present, they shouldn’t let you order it online if they don’t even have enough copies in stock.

The online support has tried to help me the best that they can so I am going to raise the score from 1 to 3 stars.They take forever to ship. I don't know how they are going to compete with Amazon.

Walmart,Walmart uses an unreliable delivery company (OnTrac),"I ordered two iPhones during Black Friday weekend (12/1/19). Walmart uses OnTrac for delivery, and I have the worst on-line shopping experience in my life. One of the phones was delivered 11 days later on 12/12/19. The second one has not been delivered yet as of 12/18/19. OnTrac website keeps changing the ""promised"" delivery date to the next day, and the next day, and the next....I have contacted both Walmart and OnTrac several times but they cannot provide any real help other than ""investigation"" and ""escalation"". I even had a 3-way call with representatives from both companies.Walmart should own this problem and never use such an unreliable partner. If Walmart wants to compete with Amazon, they need to find a more reliable courier. Around the same time that I ordered the phones, I also made online purchases from Amazon, Shutterfly, Bank of America, and Homeboy Industries (homeboyfoods.com). All orders arrived on time. In case you don't know, Homeboy Industries ""provides hope, training and support to formerly gang-involved and recently incarcerated men and women, allowing them to redirect their lives and become contributing members of the community."" Yes, they did an excellent job. Yet, Walmart, founded/owned by the richest family in the US, cannot. Shame on you, Walmart! You should be ashamed of yourself.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart Store does not refund online purchases' sales tax using Affirm,"I ordered an item from Walmart.com and I used Affirm to pay for it. I was able to pick it up in a timely manner, no problem so far. A few days later I noticed the same exact item had dropped in price by about 50 dollars at Walmart.com so I went to the store to see if I could get a price adjustment. No, I was informed that I would need to return the item and purchase it again. So I thought Ok I will return it, get a full refund and order it online again. This is where it went bonkers. If I had known that it would have been this much of a hassle I would have kept the item instead.The Walmart store only refunded the purchase price and not the sales tax. I am told I need to request the refund of the sales tax from Affirm because it was Affirm who charged the sales tax. I was confused cause that does not sound right. I purchased the item from Walmart.com and returned it to a local store and I don't get my sales tax refunded. I never opened the product. So I call Affirm and have them dispute the charge since that is the only way to not be charged the sales tax for an item I returned. Lesson learned do NOT order from Walmart.com and use Affirm to pay for your items. The customer service person also mentioned someone had purchased an expensive TV and had to get their sales tax refunded by Affirm too. So lesson learned if you purchase something from Walmart.com and use Affirm, do NOT return it cause you will not get your sales tax back and will have to dispute the charge through Affirm.Note: I had thought to reorder the item online shortly after returning the item so I could get the lower price and prior to my noticing the refund was wrong and suddenly Affirm is unavailable.",0,1
Walmart,Photo Order - Customer Service is Terrible,"I just got off the phone with a customer service manager.My issue, after talking with 5 different reps, was that my photo order got ""lost"".All they wanted to do was refund my money. I was supposed to have received this YESTERDAY. I'm a photographer and my client needed these to be delivered by then. Now, I have to spend more than double the money that I used to order these photos, double the amount of time to order them all again and get the sizing correct, and frustration of talking to many reps on the phone and not having anything get done besides refunding my money...not to mention having to go to the store and pick these photos up and deliver them to the client rather than them being mailed which was what I paid for in the first place. Through no fault of my own, all of this could have been helped if they would have just given me the difference of $7.20 (don't even care about the fuel cost to drive to the store then to get back to the clients residence) but no, all i'm offered is a refund that won't even be processed for 5-7 business days. Not so great customer service if you ask me.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart Needs to Make Changes,"Walmart's online service and store pick-up need to be updated more efficiently in matters when they do not fulfill an item you purchased that was in stock but then they send you a notice on your pick-up date that it was out of stock and they have to have it shipped from another state, regardless of the fact that the item is available at other store locations. I contacted Walmart online chat to see if I could pick-up from another available location that had my item available, but I was only offered a refund. I did not want a refund because I felt it unfair to wait an additional 3-4 days for the amount of my purchase to be placed back on my card, before repurchasing item. The item I was waiting for was shipped from NC to Va and was due to arrive three days after the original pick-up date. I then decided after no updates online that the item would probably be delayed again so I once again contacted through email and online to see if an in store credit could be offered so that I could find a store in my area that had my item in stock, but was once again turned down and only offered a refund. I do not understand why Walmart operates this way, or why they would have a system that is this inconvenient to customer. Walmart made the mistake and offered me an item that was suppose to be in stock on the day it was offered to be picked up, and because they did not honor this I can not see any reason why they could not have offered me in store credit on my purchase. This issue needs to be escalated. No one can give me an answer. Updated: As it turns out my purchase never arrived from the Fed Ex truck, matter of fact when I called back to complain to Walmart's main number It was only then that I was told that my purchase would have to be refunded because the item they ordered ""which was not from a third party but Walmart Exclusive, the item they ordered from NC location had been ""damaged"" in shipping! After all the ranting I'd done, no one had the decency to email with this update letting me know that my item had been damaged, and if not for calling Walmart directly I would have been waiting another 3 to 4 days or whenever they had decided to clear the amount they took out of my bank! They did give me a gift card to cover the amount plus a little extra for my trouble which I appreciate, but the item I purchased will now be difficult to find because it was a Walmart Exclusive limited time item, which is why I tried ordering for pick-up to begin with!",0,1

Walmart,Walmart is not the place to shop online.,"I am so disappointed with a purchase from a Walmart ""Trusted Seller"" that I will never order online from Walmart any more. I purchased a game system on cyber Monday for my 9-year old son for Christmas. I assumed that Walmart would stand behind what they sell, regardless if it is from them or one of their sellers. Just over a week before Christmas I got a notice that my package was delivered but when I got home it was nowhere to be found. It turns out that it was delivered to a storage locker in Colorado (I live in Massachusetts). That's fine, mistakes happen. When I called Walmart they assured me that they would research it and I would hear back within 24 hours. Three days later I called them again and was told that seller is no longer on their site and I would be refunded the money. Now I'm a week until Christmas and I missed the chance to find it at Cyber Monday prices if I can find one at all. I'm not sure what Walmart means by ""trusted seller"" but I do know that Walmart cannot be counted on to do the right thing.",0,1

Than I spend two days trying to get it settled and reordered they say they will give me a 10.00 coupon off my next order and never receive it, they say I will get my order before Christmas and I don't get all of it because one thing is on back order, and they other is on a delay and won't receive it until the day after out Christmas is over so my granddaughter won't have it before. Than they say I will get it for the same price I ordered it for the first time and no I did not only on a few of the items. I tell them that and they say I will fix it, and they never did. I am VERY VERY UPSET WITH WALMART.COM. I even kept the conversations we had and printed them out. I will take them into the store closest to me after I receive my items and I hope they do something about it or I would advice people to not order online through there. Their customer service was very poor they did not follow through with anything they said they would and yet said they were sorry and their service was better than this if I had a way to post our conversation I would so do!!!!! Just to show how poor it is and how wrong they were and how they don't keep their word!!",0,1

So, I called Walmart customer service. They told it wasn't going to be shipped for another 3 weeks. So, I cancelled the ordered. Now, today I'm calling to verify that my ordered was cancelled. I was advised that my order was shipped out and they couldn't process my return until it was shipped back. I had already told them my situation and they decided to process my order anyway w/o my permission.Spoke to Jean the Supervisor. It was already shipped out. It's on it's way to me.

Told me I could pay for expedited shipping of 35.00 even though the email they sent me said they would pay for the expedited shipping if it necessary. But no they couldn't do that either.

Now hears the problem only one of the items of my purchase was cancelled even though two items were out of stock. No attempt was made to change my delivery date, or choose another store for pickup nothing. The item cancelled was a high ticket item, my account was charged immediately, but I had to wait four to five business days for a refund. Nothing anyone could do and I did not have sufficient funds to purchase the item at another store. They have lost my family as a customer for good.

Walmart,I'll give one star,"I'll give one star, because zero stars isn't an option.I bought a new iPhone 11 from Walmart on the day after Thanksgiving. Within 3 days, it was shutting off randomly, and it's gotten worse since then. Today, I called Apple and they instructed me to return it to the retailer as it was within the 14-day window for an exchange.The catch? Walmart's policy is that any phone must be returned to the same store it was purchased from. In my case, it happened to be a store three hours away. At no point in time was that policy mentioned at the point of purchase. The receipt itself says that ""Postpaid cell phones may be returned for refund or exchange with receipt WITHIN 14 DAYS."" (Emphasis theirs.)No mention of any policy related to same store. I live five minutes away from another store, but two individuals at that store (including the assistant store manager) and two individuals at the 1-800 number reiterated that same policy.So I'm left with a non-functioning $700 brand new iPhone that I would have to go on a 6-hour round trip to swap for the same phone that I should be able to get less than a mile from here.Horrible customer service. Horrible. Even the two individuals I spoke with from Apple were clearly surprised by the policy. Word to the wise: be very careful when dealing with Walmart. I'll spend a little more to buy from a retailer that puts their customers first. Clearly, that's not Walmart.",0,1

But I just left my desk within 3 minutes!Then I asked another agent, he told me to file a police report without even an instruction and close this chat.Really disappointed about the customer service and Walmart.

Walmart,Walmart Suffers from Lack of Concern about Customers,"Walmart customer service staff at North Richland Hills store is incompetent, at best. Even worse, they openly complain about the processes in place for returning items.We are returning an IPad bought as a gift with several other electronic items.The first pass, the local associates put the purchase price on a Walmart gift card instead of crediting back the price on our credit card, as per process.When we went to check out with the card, the cashier told us the card was not activated. We had all the paperwork so a CSR walked us to Customer Service. The first story: No, the process was wrong. Instead of getting a gift card, a Walmart rep on the phone (when asked where the local CSR said “in Bentonville” but she wasn’t all that certain). The “Bentonville” rep said, no, he would send an email confirming the return and a printable label that we could drop the IPad in the mail to them, or bring it back to the store.When the email arrived, he had refunded the other items purchased with the IPad, but not the IPad. Fortunately we were still at the store.The same CSR got back on the phone to the “Bentonville” rep and was told, no, she (TheCSR) was to take the IPad and return it. And here is the really weird part: the Walmart CSR would take the receipt and IPad, and we can trust them to get us a refund in “a week or two”.Not going to do that!So now we have talked with one “Bentonville” rep who basically disconnected—put us on hold and never returned.We are on the phone with another “Bentonville” rep and have to repeat the entire story a second time.No discount—and it was really only about $15 cheaper than Best Buy, is worth this aggravation and wasted time.Whatever the result, and I thoroughly believe we could be here another hour trying to get some resolution, this type of service is the “new Walmart”.

Walmart,BEWARE! NEVER AGAIN!!,"What an absolute fing NIGHTMARE and SCAM! I wish I could give them a rating of -0. NEVER EVER USE WAL-MART.COM OR AFFIRM!Our tv kicked the bucket so We decided to splurge a little bit and upgrade (We work hard and don't splurge often so why not an early Christmas present right?) So we orderd a '70inch TV off of Wal-mart.com using their financing company Affirm. That was November 13th and our tv was delivered on the 18th. When our tv arrived we opend it to find a split down the back and when we plugged it in it looked like nothing but neon water color. We were completely bummed but since we orderd it from Wal-mart.com we called our local store explained the situation and asked if we could exchange it. The ales associate I talked to (Jean) said ""sure. No problem"". So my husband and I drove down to the store and we were directed to electronics. We explained to them the situation showed them the recipt and tv. They did say that they don't carry RCA anymore but that they have a 65inch tv better quality and cheaper. My husband and I were fine with that, chose a TV and went to customer service to finish the transaction...thinking it would take only few minutes depending if there was a line.The associate upfront was Jean. At first she was very nice and helpful because apparently there was a hiccup with exchanging because although it was orderd from Wal-mart.com because we used their financing and not a straight up Wal-mart card there was an issue (which btw I'm still kind of confused about). After she figured there was a hiccup she became rude and short and said ""I've been working for 14 hours and I haven't eaten. I can't deal with this anymore. Call Wal-mart.com"" and she huffed away and completely ignored my husband and I hit bossily told her fellow associate to take the tv we brought in back to our car that she would no longer be helping us. We were dumb founded and speechless. So we took our tv back home and called Wal-mart.comWe explained to the associate at Wal-mart.com our situation. She apologized and then put us on hold for 20 minutes. She came back and said that we can't take the tv to a store even though we orderd it from Wal-mart.com that we would have to have it picked up but that they will put in an order to have another one shipped and that it would arrive December 2nd. We asked if she could expedite the shipping since the tv came damaged. She said that they don't do that. At this point it was late, we were tired and we figured what's a few weeks without a TV, having a 70ich will be a payoff.The company picked up the tv on time the following Monday. We waited a few days to check the status of our new tv and all it said was processing. So we called Wal-mart.com customer service. After giving the associate our information and asking her what the status is with our tv she put us on hold for 20 minutes. She finally comes back and says ""we are still waiting for the old tv to be accepted and processed but you should still recieve your tv on 12/2"".This conversation (and being on hold for 20 minutes each time)took place several times because the status never changed with the damaged tv. Each time we looked it said processed.So today I called. Ill be honest my patience was gone and I was short with the associate. I had had enough of the run around. I explained our situation to the male associate and explained that I'm frustrated and sick of waiting and that i want to know what's going on. After being put on hold for 20 minutes so they can ""check The status"" The associate came back and stated that the damaged tv has still to be processed and because it hasn't been processed the earliest we could have a TV deliverd is 12/12 if they get it processed within the next 24 hours and if they don't It could take longer. Well that did it. I admit I lost it. I told the associate that this was unacceptable and the WORST customer service EVER! That they can pick up a damaged tv on time but not process it and get a new one out in a timely manner. I told the customer service that it's unacceptable to put customers on hold for 20 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME to do some that takes 30 seconds to a minute because i too once worked in customer service. He said this is the best he could offer. I explained to him that i wanted to speak to a manager. He put me on hold for 15 minutes then hung up on me.I called back and this time spoke to a female associate. I told her to cancel my order because they are nothing but a scam and that i would let everyone know.WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!DO NOT USE WAL-MART.COM OR AFFIRM!!

I asked him if he had them all and he told me yes. Well when I got home, I went threw all the bags and I was so mad because half of my order was not even in the bags. I called them right away and told the girl I just picked up my order and I have a lot of stuff missing. Not even 10 minutes and the manager called me and told me that I would have to call customer service because they just do not have the staff to go and pick my items again. He told me he would look at the video to see what happened. Good because I wasted my time and gas to come and get what I paid for and then didn't get half of it. Now I have to go back to the store and get my things that I need. So not happy whatsoever with this store.

Easy, just let me pick out another TV, and reimburse me any extra owed to me. No. Was not that simple. This woman had no clue what to do. She offered me a Gift Card when I paid with my credit card. ""No, I said."" I purchased with a credit card, which means if I accepted her offer I Would pay for the same TV twice. So she said I could go get another TV and use my card, (NEW CARD User) and so I went to get another TV, and was declined when I used my card. So I call my credit card provider, and asked what's the deal, and was told it would be up to five days before the money was issued back to my account. So today, I get a bill for the TV that was returned, and I had to call my credit card provider again and ask what the hell?

Of course, the lines will already be long, with at least 6-7 shoppers ahead of us. At this time, we are going to start looking impatient, heads turning to see if any registers will open. (of course they won't, because they really don't care, they feel they are special, I mean, heck, everyone has to buy groceries, Christmas shopping, right?) Wrong! We will be very restless and impatient for about 5-8 minutes, then one by one, we will throw our hands up, leave those carts right there and walk out the door as exasperated shoppers. Then you can all meet me at Dunkin Doughnuts or wherever and I will buy you a cup of coffee, tea, mocha, latte. We will do this everyday for a week to see if we make a difference. After this, we will pick the next store that doesn't care about our time spent at checkout, like maybe Hobby Lobby, Tops, until we, the customers or democrats get the attention of big box stores.

Walmart,The Customer Is The Boss...HAH!  NOT,"On 9/27, I ordered a Fram air filter for my car from Walmart.com. I received a Barbie doll instead of the air filter I ordered. I contacted Walmart.com Customer Care & advised the ""expert"" of the situation. A ""replacement"" part was ordered, & I was given instructions to take the doll to a local Walmart store. This seemed unusual, so I questioned these instructions. The CS agent again advised to take the doll to a local store. I followed these instructions, & did finally receive the correct item, on 10/9. I also received $1.57 refund for my troubles. On 11/7, I received an email from Walmart.com advising that they had not yet received the incorrect item their employee picked & sent to me in error, & provided a shipping label, 1 month after calling Customer Care regarding receipt of the wrong item. Another email was sent from Walmart.com on 11/12, to which I contacted Customer Care & explained that I had received these emails, & to advise the wrong item was taken to a local store. This ""expert"" advised they were processing a full refund for the purchase price ($33.51) of the filter, but would take 5 business days to receive the refund in my account. After my call, Walmart proceeded to take $31.94 from my account for the purchase price of the air filter, minus the refund for my ""troubles"", claiming that they were taking this money because I had not returned the Barbie doll. Walmart took money out of my account without my consent. I have now paid twice for 1 Fram air filter. Yet another call to Customer Care, another ""promise"" of my money being returned within 5 business days. It is now day 5....neither amount has been posted to my account. What a nightmare!!! Too many errors....now they're stealing from their customers. Like they need the money. DO NOT ORDER FROM WALMART.COM. THEY DO NOTHING BUT SCREW UP & STEAL YOUR MONEY.",0,1

Call and the bed is now out of stock and the only thing they can do is refund the money which takes 5 days. So now after many calls and lots of wasted time. Now it is November 18th and I'm back on a bed hunt. I was told I would get a 20% discount if they couldn't find the box so I could order another bed that far more expensive from the second person I talked to but now they said it was only if I kept the half of a bed they sent, WHAT!!!!!!!

I was gone all of one minute. When I came back the bossy woman was ringing up her 50 items. I asked the salesgirl what was going on and she said she ""watched"" my stuff. Needless to say, I was rather angry. The bossy woman told the salesgirl, ""You didn't do nothing wrong.""I had to wait another 15 to 20 minutes for another self-scan register to open. Then there was another screw and the useless salesgirl gingerly told me I could just ""ring everything up all over again.""I insisted on seeing the manager and was told the main manager wasn't there. I was so angry I could hardly contain myself. I spoke to two supposedly lower managers and told that these screws up happen nearly every !@#@$ time I shop there and that they need to get their !@#$ together.Then as I was leaving the alarm went off, even though I didn't steal anything. I then had to wait another 5 to 10 minutes for the security guard to come over and search through my bags, with everyone staring at me.I have had it with Wall-Mart.

So they canceled my order and promised me a gift card in the amount of my total purchase and a full refund, none of which happened. They tied my money up and only sent me a $25 gift card for my inconvenience. Now I have nothing to give my fiancé for his birthday nor any money to buy him something else.

I have shopped at Walmart for years and have had mixed experiences with them , but one particular Walmart in Seaford Delaware is the worst Walmart I have ever seen. I ordered groceries through the grocery app, because I wanted to try it. They of course screwed it up, brought me items I did not even order, every egg in the carton was broken and my rolls were smashed. Took the items back that I did not order and said they would do a refund which even after multiple calls still did not happen. You can never find more than 1 maybe 2!at the most lanes open with cashiers, yet 15 employees can be standing around doing nothing. My last trip to Walmart really pushed me over the edge, like anyone else I am always looking for a good deal so I search their site before I go shopping. I make sure the location is set for the store I am shopping. I finished shopping and proceeded to the register. I very nicely told the cashier that certain items were ringing up wrong and showed her on my phone on their app what the price was listed for. She called over someone else. I did not notice his name but if you shop at this store he is tall and skinny with shoulder length brown straggly hair and his face looks like he may have tried to grow a beard but just has patches of facial hair. I showed him the same thing I had shown the cashier. I made sure my item matched the item on line perfectly. He told me the item I wanted was not in stock and he would not honor that price. ( how is it not in stock when it is sitting right in front of you) I argued with him and still stuck to his story that they were not in stock. He was rude and cocky and arrogant. I was calm and polite the entire time , yet he became more belligerent with each word. You should never speak to a customer the way he spoke to me and on a side note someone who looks as scummy and obviously unbathed as he did has no place to be so cocky and arrogant.

I ended up going to the confirmation email, copying the order number there, and wading through the very not customer friendly customer service web site to send an email The reply was very quick, explained that the 3 missing items could be refunded or shipped and that I should let them know which I wanted. There were no instructions as to ""reply to this email, or click the attachment, or use the button"". I had to again copy the number associated with the response and start a new email string. I was really frustrated, it was a pain to navigate and given the choice of other online stores and Walmart.com, I will never use Walmart.com again if I can help it.",0,2

Could these Walmart vendors be running a scam by shipping out old stock, not a great seller 9” minicomputer when I clearly ordered a 11.6” screen?

Walmart,Walmart's Dishonest,"Two months ago an Onn tablet was purchased at Walmart. Onn tablets are a Walmart product. A couple of weeks ago the battery stopped charging; and when it's plugged into the charger it say's it's overheating. Went back to the Walmart it was purchased at in Fredericksburg, VA, Central Park Shopping Center to return it. I was literally standing right in front of the sign, at customer service, that states that Walmart is happy to give a refund or exchange on any purchase with or without a receipt for 90 days. Guess what; this was 60 days and they would NOT take it back. I was told that on this tablet it's only a 15 day return policy, even if the darn thing stops working and the claim it has a year warranty. All we wanted was a store credit to purchase another brand of tablet. This should be very easy for them, since all they have to do is send the returned back to Onn as defective. Now they've lost a more lucrative sale and a whole family of customers!I already knew that Walmart does price gouging on some necessary items--(such as baby needs), and some times of the year--such as during a snowstorm.

Walmart,"Walmart Warner Robins, Georgia on Watson Blvd.","Good evening. I wanted to let you know about a troubling experience I had the last two days at a WalMart Auto Center in Warner Robins, Georgia at 2720 Watson Blvd. This is store #01367. I came in with my son on 10/22/19 to purchase two tires. We instructed the technician to replace the front driver's side tire and to place a new tire on the front driver's side. We asked for the passenger side front tire to be rotated to the back of the passenger side. This was to ensure that my son would have two new tires on the front of his car. First, I was informed by the technician that to move one tire from the front to the back would constitute a tire rotation and would cost $48.00. This seemed excessive, but I agreed. Next, when we returned to pick up the car, we found that our instructions had not been followed. We were told that moving our original front passenger tire to the back was against store policy even though the Walmart site clearly indicates that a single tire can be moved from one location to another for a mere $2.50, not the $48 I was charged. Then, we were informed that the technicians discarded our perfectly good front passenger tire and replaced it with a new tire. This was not what was requested. However, in doing so, they failed to replace the tire I actually wanted, the rear passenger tire which was very thin on tread. By the time we realized this, I had already paid for two tires, a tire rotation, and an oil change. The auto center was closing and we resolved to return the next day. Upon returning today, the on-duty manager whose name was Brent or Brant told my husband that despite the fact that their employees made a mistake, we would just have to buy a third tire. He offered a trivial $24.00 off the price of the tire, but said he had no more of the desired tire in stock and that he could sell us a more expensive tire. He said he would call us on Friday, two days from today when the new tire was in stock. He made no attempt rectify the price of the tire rotation, which is obviously not the service I requested.Additionally, my son, whose vehicle it was, never signed for any transaction. However, a signature that was a mere squiggly line was shown on the order. Obviously, he did not consent to the changes they made.So, at this point, my son still has an inadequate tire that has yet to be replaced. I am hesitant to wait for Friday. This auto center has lost all credibility with me. I have no faith that the tire will be in stock, that we will receive a call, or that the desired service will be completed with any fidelity. In short, we are done with this Walmart. There are too many service options in our area to persist in visiting a retailer who I do not trust, especially when it comes to something as important as a tire. When I buy a tire for my college-age son, his life is in the hands of those who perform this service work. I feel as though we were manipulated, deceived, and cheated.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart auto service at New Hartford,"Walmart auto service at New Hartford, NY. Today, October 19, 2019. I had a problem with air leaking out of my tire, frustrating to have to add air daily. I used the Walmart $10 tire plan so service was free. Honestly they need more help because I arrived at 6:50am and by the time the door opened at 7:00am 4 people were waiting. Howard took the stress out of the situation, said it would be fixed right away, turned out it was not a sensor or a puncture but a leak around the rim. Problem resolved with issues. Thank you again Howard. I will always buy my tires here and always get the $10 per tire repair deal. So worth it. No arguments, they just fix or replace. Service is very customer oriented and it shows. Thank you again. I appreciate it. Sheryl",0,5
Walmart,Walmart has terrible customer service.,"Walmart has terrible, terrible customer service and their employees know jack squat! I needed help in the electronics system and there was a lady that helped me but sold me the wrong thing! I then tried to return it and was gave more wrong information from another employee. At this time the manager was called down and I had discussed my situation with him but he basically said there was nothing he could do about it. No returns were possible so I was ripped off by the poor employee knowledge. If I would have just been helped out by an employee who knew something I wouldn’t be having this issue. Walmart has lost my service as well as my families service as we will no longer be shopping there. :)",0,1

I was told I have to send it to China. Then I was told by Enrique that he wasn’t really the manager. What a rip off then I called the corporate office and was told the same by a snotty guy named Chris. When I asked for his supervisors name he hesitated and I asked again. He finally gave me the assistant operations manager and said that he does not speak to customers. What kind of dog and pony show is Walmart running. Any other store around would replace it but not Walmart because they are more interested in screwing the public then anything else. What kind of store gives you a sales associate when you ask for the manager. Either they have been told to not put managers on the phone or they just don’t care I also spoke to mekina and Chris at corporate office. Said policy is only good for 3 months. Chris is a very rude and seems to not really to interested in talking to public. I asked him for his supervisors name and at first he wouldn’t give it to me. Finally he gave me his name which is William with the title of assistant operational manager. But then said William does not talk to customers. We will see I plan on starting Monday morning at 9:00am and will continue to call them until I speak to the allusive William who never talks to customers.

I then went to the department and ""Picked the Same Product UP"" and proceeded to check-out. At check-out, I noticed the Product Price is now different. The lady at the check-out directed me to Service Desk, Ok, I understand this. I get to Service Desk only to be directed back to the department of the product. When I told her to just refund the money, She then, only then, got another scanner and looked the price up even though I already told her the Price Is Different and showed her on the app. It Scanned the price, of course, it check-out for, not the actual price listed on the display. I told her I was going to check the price again because I know it to be on the counter display.

I do think the experience can vary wildly by store location, and there are definitely some stores that aren't as well run as others, but most of the locations I have been to are clean and organized well. The employees, for the most part, are friendly and at least at my local store are always willing to go the extra step to help with finding an item. The app is 99% great, the only issue is that sometimes the items that they say are in stock really aren't, and sometimes when it says an item is not stocked at a certain store, they actually do have it. That aside, it's easy to use. The prices are of course really good on most items.",0,4

Walmart,"Walmart Vallejo - Grocery Pickup, second time around..not so great","I used Walmart grocery pickup service a little over a week ago. My first experience was a great one (Thelma & Mary) that I rated 5 stars...a week later, not so much.My second order, which I picked up today, wasn't particularly large..maybe 30 items?I used the grocery app on my phone to check in when I left the house at 1:03pm (Monday Oct 7th) and arrived at the pickup area (stall 3) at approx 1:07pm. The app asked me for the stall # and color of my car, which I entered, and then I sat...and sat...30 minutes later the crew wheeled my order out. I rejected an item (no problem with that) and began bagging my items in my reusable bags...I have a disability and mentioned it to the gal checking me in, but no offer to assist bagging or lifting the bags into the car. When I emptied one crate, then next one had 7 bottles of Barefoot Cabernet Sauvignon that I did not order. I hadn't ordered that at all, so I brought this to her attention and she said that I had actually ordered 12 bottles. I HAD ordered 1 bottle of Menage a Trois California Red wine, which was there, but she insisted that I must have 'accidentally' ordered the 12 bottles of Barefoot (yuk) Cab...I didn't want to argue, so I rejected the items. The system wouldn't let her remove the items, so she enlisted the help of a co-worker who got the items removed. Apparently the scanner on the device was locked up or something.Next a few items from the order were missing, which were left inside the store, so there was further delay while another worker went inside to get it.It was hot outside and I was beginning to feel poorly, so I showed my ID for the 1 bottle of wine (I'm 66 years old), signed for it and left for home.I'm not angry, but I am disappointed with this second experience. I'm a senior with a disability, so I was really excited to learn that my local neighborhood Walmart had started pickup service, which would save me time and a lot of discomfort, walking through the store and shopping. Like I said, my first experience with pickup was wonderful, this second not so much. Hoping you'll use this review as an educational tool for the employees. Since this pickup service is relatively new, employees may need some additional training...or maybe just some practice!Also, it might be a sound practice to have the manager on duty check the equipment (scanner/check in device). That was a part of the problem and something beyond the control of the employee. Perhaps add something to the training about offering assistance to seniors and persons with disabilities...we'd really appreciate it!I'll be back again, but hoping for the same service I got the first time.

First of all they charge a delivery fee no matter how much your order is, totally ridiculous. Then they delivered me 4 expired food products, 2 of which were the lunch item I wanted. And I don’t mean a week expired. They were over a month expired! Who even keeps month long expired products on the shelves???After a week of back and forth emails I’ve only received a partial credit and they keep insisting I’ve received a full credit, despite me showing them I haven’t. Also, unlike target or sprouts delivery, Walmart charges you for each bag they use. I had a small order and 11 bags were used, many bags had 1 small item per bag (like a small box of granola bars) even the delivery girl commented saying she didn’t know why they would do that. Gee let me guess, because the people putting my order together couldn’t care less. They clearly have no clue and don’t care and good luck if something goes wrong.

Walmart,Major problem,Ok here goes. I bought a futon bed in april that was supposed to he new. When i got it the box had been repackaged and no plastic covering on the matress itself. Didnt think much of it until a few months down the road i start seeing little brown bugs crawling on me. I had looked underneath the mattress and found a couple but not very many that I could see of but I have never dealt with bed bugs before so I really had no idea what I was dealing with. I thought they were coming from our basements or the carpet or something. They have progressively gotten worse and as of today I had an exterminator come into my home and tell me that that matress was the source of the bed bugs. He said the accumulation is the right time frame for when I got the bed and he sees it quite often when beds are resold after being returned or any factory where they are exposed to other things. I have let Walmart corporate know but they did not offer to reimburse me anything or even apologize for the situation. The only one that did where the customer service people that helped me over the phone. I am very upsets I am having massive anxiety attacks due to its I can't sleep at night and now I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars trying to fix the problem. I know for a fact this is the source because not only did the exterminator tell me so but I do not have company in my house and I am so busy that I don't go to anybody's house I just go to work go to school and come home. Im an extremely clean person and i honestly didnt think the matress was the sourse until they told me it was.

On 9/24 I received a notice that the box spring I'd ordered with it had been delivered early, then I received a separate email telling me the mattress itself was on backorder. I called to ask how long and was told indefinitely. I proceeded to shop on the site for another mattress and confirmed with customer service that it was in stock and the 2 day delivery was correct. This time I did receive a confirmation stating the mattress would arrive on 9/26 (2 days as described on the product page) so we were happy he'd only have two more nights on the floor. The next day I received a notification it had shipped but when I checked the tracking FedEx stated it had not been received by them yet. Fast forward and it's the 27th and they started a new order for me that now will not ship out until the 30th and may arrive 10/2....I'm so done with them I can't even. Now even going to some other site will not get mattress faster. NEVER AGAIN",0,2

Walmart,My order was cancelled 6 different times,"I wasted several hours on their website attempting to purchase a gift card for a friend who specifically requested it to help with her Christmas shopping. One would think giving a store money for their own gift card would be seamless but after 6 attempts, my order kept getting cancelled because they couldn't ""verify my payment information"". I used 2 separate credits and PayPal, double-checking that all of my information was correct - still every. single. time. the order was cancelled. I contacted their customer service who told me twice the order would be ""manually verified"" so it would go through - wrong. Then I was told it was my bank's fault - by bank said wrong. Even though they are the only verified vendor of their own gift cards, attempting to purchase one is a complete waste of time.",0,1

Walmart,My 14 year old daughter purchased a…,"My 14 year old daughter purchased a monitor at Walmart.com, using two gift cards from Walmart and a few dollars from her own debit card. The monitor came without HDMI ports and no stereo capability. Anyway, we took it to the store to exchange it for something with HDMI ports; however, after waiting to talk to someone about it, they said it can’t be returned in store. I asked where we can return it, and they said “the marketplace”. What marketplace? After about twenty minutes of waiting, they printed out a receipt that said to contact Walmart.com or contact Walmart’s customer care team. I’m like, I’m standing inside Walmart?!? Isn’t this a bit ridiculous to have to call Walmart customer care? Anyway, I proceeded to call their number and was transferred from a live person to an automated system, then, I proceeded to wait on hold for another twenty minutes; at the end of my hold time , I was connected with some lady from India that I couldn’t understand at all! Broken English and unable to understand what I was saying to her about trying to exchange or return the item. What I could get out of her, was that their customer care had closed ten minutes ago (while we were waiting in Walmart for a printout of who to call to return the item) and I could try again tomorrow at 9:00 am to speak with someone else. I hung up the phone and told the cashier he could keep the monitor and I went to Best Buy and bought her a new one. Waste of time. Worst customer service ever.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart.com - The dog that won't hunt.,"Honestly I'd have given one star but I usually don't pay attention to one star reviews, so the two stars are generous.To start off the ""2 Day Free Shipping"" has never been 2 days, not even 2 business days. I'm never in a hurry to get an order from Walmart.com so the order arriving in ""2 Days"" is not an issue for me with the exception that it's a false promise. They should change their shipping advertisement to ""Free Shipping"" and drop the ""2 Day"", it would increase trust if they advertised what they actually provide rather then what the bean counters say the customer wants.Their packaging of products is the worse I've ever experienced. Even the worst Ebay items I've ever received have been packaged better then Walmart.com orders. The packaging is utterly terrible! I've had two orders this year that haven't even made it to my home because the items in the packages were leaking so badly, (one contained engine oil and the other contained dish soap). Canned foods, I can usually deal with dented cans and if you order any canned goods from Walmart.com you'll have to expect that 75% of them will be dented, the box will have busted open and resealed by FedEx and some cans will be dented at the top rim of the can and cannot be opened in an electric can opener. I've had some cans that I've had to use a P38 can opener, (look it up), to say the least some cans from Walmart.com can be challenging. The most recent development is the dreaded ""Out of Stock"" when trying to order something. For the last six weeks Hormel Chili has been ""Out of Stock"", among many other items that I have regularly ordered for years. From what I've been seeing I have to come to the conclusion that they are advertising the items but are not actually selling them online anymore because of shipping costs, inability to get their employees to properly package the items to prevent damage, customer complaints about item condition... or any and all the fore mentioned reasons. I used to be able to sit at my computer and put an order together (over $35 for the Free Shipping) in about 15 minutes. Now because of the frequency of the ""Out of Stock"" option that Walmart.com has implemented it has been taking me days to put an order together of items that are ""in stock"".A year ago I used to tell people about the benefits and convenience of shopping Walmart.com for my everyday needs, now I'm steering people towards Amazon Prime Pantry. Amazon Prime Pantry can be kind of wonky with having to fill a box to place an order but... Amazon Prime Pantry has the products that I want in stock, they package the items purchased with care, and they arrive faster... Amazon Prime used to be a couple steps above Walmart.com now Amazon Prime is miles ahead of Walmart.com, not because Amazon Prime has become that much better but because Walmart.com has become that much worse.I really can't find much good to say about the current Walmart.com. I still order through Walmart.com but not nearly as much as in previous years, I've been using Prime Pantry more and more.",0,2

Some they are no longer carrying, others they just didn't have stock. Employees filling online orders blocked aisles and were rude. I know they have a job to do, but as an in store customer I got the message that they would prefer I not be there. I picked up an item on a shelf that had a large display of like items, across the top of shelf was multiple large signs that said clearance and no not on clearance. To top it off there are 20+ check out lanes with only one that had a checker. I opted to use the self checkout against my better judgement. My first item rang up at the wrong price. Two items later it said I needed assistance, once again waiting on employee as she was helping other customers who were also having trouble, she did what ever she was supposed to do and it said no action needed. Really! Very frustrating, especially since this has become the norm. I will be doing the bulk of my shopping elsewhere in the future.

Walmart,Walmart is going in the wrong direction by joining Bloomberg,"Disappointed that Wal-Mart has gone political and increasingly poor quality on some items such as clothing. Quality on clothes and some food items have become increasingly iffy. Despite this I have been defender of Walmart and been a loyal shopper because you could get most items in one place including ammo (Walmart says no more). My liberal friends dislike Walmart because of image, social and employee issues. My left leaning friends would never set foot in a Walmart even to support Walmart's new policies on firearms and ammunition. Walmart has now joined with Bloomberg and the organizations that he bankrolls. That is disappointing since Bloomberg wants to restrict constitutional and individual rights which includes the 2nd Amendment but that is just the start since Bloomberg wants to control most aspects of our lives. In New York, Bloomberg tried to restrict what and how much people could eat and drink. Hope that Walmart got a great deal from Bloomberg because they have lost some of their defenders and likely will loose some loyal customer business.",0,1
Walmart,When Walmart bites the dust. I will call it Karma.,"My rating is zero, however you must post at least a star. Sam's clubs are closing and that is good news.

Nothing came of it because their Corporate Office does not care. Fast forward to 9/2019. I saw a shed for sale on Yahoo priced $510.00 it said only 1 remaining. After going through process of purchase it said that it was ""out of stock item moved to the saved for later part of cart"". If the item was no longer available the listing should have been removed. The following day it was on Yahoo again for $799.00. I called the Corporate Office and after more than a half hour I was told it would be expedited and I would receive a call in the afternoon. This is a classic case of ""bait snd switch"" This product is currently on the same site for $699.00. The expedited return call was never made. Nothing was notated. After two additional calls to Corporate their remedy was a discount for a next purchase which I told them to keep. Customer Service no longer exists.

Funny thing, the day before I went an bought two of the smooshy mushy plushies with no problem at all, why the change of mind all of a sudden, I've got no clue. At this point I'm done with Walmart I'm just going to buy the plushies online and that's the last of Walmart for me. They seriously need to work on the employees, and the price matching.",0,1

I can not stress this enough, do not order from them ever! There is no such thing as two Day they lie. Also I have lost count as to how many times my orders have been “lost” or broken or forgotten or “I don’t know what happened”. I am done and will NEVER shop online or in store again. Amazon is the best company and delivers next day. Totally worth the extra few dollars. You suck Walmart !!!",0,1
Walmart,They Ship if you are filling a cart and leave it.  Beware of uncleanliness of products from Marketplace sellers,"They use secondary sellers.

Spoke with a very nice person in the Philippines (great compensation and command of English sentences and polite) who transferred me to Carla on the resolution USA team who resisted strongly giving me to her boss when she could not help me. When she did things got resolved, but I lost total trust for Walmart due to my experience with resolution rep Carla in the USA. Another thing is that I fill my cart before payday. Walmart shipped 2 cans of soup to a store I don’t use and then shipped the order before it was complete or I was ready with money. I deleted all my stuff out of save for later due to this. Carla wanted me to contact the company who was secondary so they could hear about what happened. They advertised it as new and even had the picture of the box. This can be purchased for a dollar more from Walgreens in a sealed package that is clean and un contaminated.",0,1

Walmart,Buyer beware,"Don’t shop at walmart if you’re sick, stressed out, or in a hurry. Pick a day when you can take your time. Why? Shelf prices are often lower than actual prices. Also, they don’t rotate stock and discard expired foods. If you’re not observant of every little detail you’ll find yourself having to deal with the staff, who are quite rude and who like to pretend that walmart merchandise and even the building itself are their personal property. I once got yelled at by a walmart janitor while I was on the toilet for walking on “her” floor. I’m writing this review having just packed up several bags of packaged produce for return because it had been expired for four days on the day I purchased it.

The store only had Register 6 open. The self cash out had lines out to the make up and at the other end of the store the self check out line went into the womans active wear. Getting back to Register 6 that line was 7 deep. I counted. When I asked if another register could be open I was told that they didn't have the staff to open another register. As a customer I do not care about your multi- million dollar business not having enough staff. What ever happened to 3 customers in line, customer service call up another register person?In the meantime I saw 6 people up front doing literally nothing. 3 associates were talking about their personal life. I over heard them and they were talking about car issues. 2 of the associates were on their cell phones. The other associate was just standing with her arms folded.This is the second incident in 2 weeks I had an issue with this company. I have decided not to continue shopping at any of your stores.

Walmart,STOLE SENTIMENTAL KEY CHAIN,I went here to get a battery in my car and someone STOLE my hook on my key chain. The lady tried to hand me my keys and I was like them aren't mine. Because the hook was off I didn't recognize them. It is shame that someone would take something that didn't belong to them and they knew it wasn't there's. They rearrange my keys when they took it off. That hook had sentimental value to me as my grannie gave it to me before she passed. I was so upset I just walked out and went back to my car and cried my eyes out. People should really think and respect others property when getting service here. The manager did ask if they were sold there but I knew they weren't because she NEVER shopped at walmart. I will never go to this Auto center and I advise everyone to examine there belongings before going to this location. And to the person that took it. I pray that you see this post and you turn it in just say you found it no one has to know you intentionally STOLE something that was not yours and have the manager call me and give it back.

So now I've reported it fraud and cancelled my credit card. Then I see a email in my junk mail saying I didn't send the mattress back and they are taking the money back!!! I have been on the phone all day with the Asians and had to be asked to be transferred to the United States after they were too incompetent to do anything or even find the order. I was told my order would be refunded and I would get a email. It's been four hours and no such email has been sent and I called my bank and lifted the fraud alert because they had promised me to refund it.

Three employees explained to me on Saturday that they are ""NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO HELP ANYONE WITH THIER PHONE"". Two little ladies just needed the letters bigger... So I did it.

Walmart,Visited the North Lauderdale store,Visited the North Lauderdale store on 25 August. Once in the fast queue to pay for 10/20 items or less I was appalled by the wait to be served. This was due the family in front having some sort issue. We were eventually served by a lady called Rhona who was rude and unhelpful and did not apologise for the delay and when asked by my mother what the delay was nearly bit my mother’s head off!! She urgently needs further training as her people skills leave much to be desired plus she was slower than a snail. I would not go back to this branch due to this lady’s shoddy service and will probably check out other branches in future as she put me off and obviously does not enjoy her job.

I thought it was one customer service rep., but I went through 4 and I can tell they lack a system nor care. I hope I can help people through my experience.1. My item was broken, i thought heck let me go online and I see a return button for previously ordered items. I press it and it get greyed out, you would think it's going to be refunded2. A week later I call find out from a rep that clicking return online did nothing at all. I had to speak to someone to get a fedex to pick up this heavy book case, OK so what was the whole return button online but whatever let me repackage this huge thing and leave it outside. I asked the rep for a package number or label, she said I won;t get it on time for tomorrows pickup...a little shady leaving the box outside without a label but you figure it's Walmart.3. A week passes nothing..no refund...i call again, and new rep seems confused. She brushes me off saying wait one more day to see if the package comes to their warehouse, its been week, the first rep told me the next day after pick up I would be refunded. 4. A week again, nothing, I call and finally get transferred to a higher up rep who refunds me after waiting on the phone for 30 minutes.I want to start off by saying..this is me, a customer who got sent a broken item, why do I need to chase everyone around to get my money back? This is the manufacturers, shippers, Walmart issue not me, I should not need to go through this. Second, quality control is missing here, your representatives are front runners and they clearly show it, they are not helpful, they are not friendly.

Walmart,DO NOT BUY BICYCLES AT WALMART,"Needless to say when looking for quality one does NOT buy products from Walmart Please note this is my first social media review so to understand it took certain amount of energy to want to even write a review. Sadly it is a bad one. Advise: if even you think of buying a bicycle @ Walmart DON’T We bought two and both needed to be returned. The first one the pedal fell off before my son even could get on it. The second broke within one day. One of the pedal literally disintegrated while the gears warped and stated the grind. The brake cable fell off...can’t express enough the dangerous impact this could have caused. I tried to return the bicycle where we bought it at Teaticket Massachusetts but they would not accept because it was 8 days later and they apparently have a “strict” 7 day no return policy....Policy which was of course never disclosed at purchase. The return clerk who claimed to be the manager on 8/18/19 in the evening was uncooperative...doubtfully the manager (hopefully for whatever image (NOT) Walmart is trying to uphold. Living 5 hours away in CT and Walmart unwilling to cooperate or offer any kind of solution, I left the 8 day falling apart bicycle at Walmart. We tried again over the phone to have Walmart act professionally and with courtesy...but NO So our advise: If anything related to Walmart....DO NOT BICYCLES @ WALMARTDon’t waste your well earned money.

Walmart,NEVER work for Walmart,"I worked for walmart for almost exactly one year. The people there in my crew were like family and I loved and still love them all, but management and corporate are the cruelest people I've ever met. Almost every day for that whole year I went home crying, wishing they'd just fire me already. Our store manager only ever focused on the stockers, while everyone in the back room were, at all times, the very last priority. We got paid the same but we were pushed to our very limits every day, and when we questioned him why our jobs kept getting more specific and harder constantly, his response would always be something along the lines of ""think of the bigger picture. If the stockers aren't doing all of this they get the products on the shelves faster"" but us doing that makes the process longer because we're getting the products out later, proving all any of them think about is the stockers. The stockers will do half their job sometimes and shove what they didn't feel like doing in the back room for the next day and the manager will get onto us for it. I know they do this because I have friends who stock, they never get in trouble and their jobs keep getting easier with more new policies. We're not allowed overtime but if we don't stay late we get coached and this applies to only the backroom (at least at store 622). I've overheard a woman talking with an associate telling her to leave early because she had 26 minutes of overtime, which is ridiculous. When we stay late busting our a**es they call us and tell us to come in late to cut our overtime, which we ""technically"" have a legal right to refuse, but if we do we get b****ed at. Lastly, I got fired for having too many points. I got called in the office and questioned about it. When I told them my doctor told me not to walk on my foot AT ALL but I've only been calling in the days it hurts very very bad, they then still proceeded to fire me. A guy in my crew had 4 more call ins than I had just a few weeks prior and he got his points completely removed, which shows me that they don't care about the points and they're showing favoritism.",0,1
Walmart,Walmart Credit policies,"I have had a Walmart Credit card for few years. After starting my credit limit from $500 due to good payments on my part twice, without my asking for it, I received 2 increases from Walmart, for being a good customer I was told. I never defaulted on any payment and then just last month I decided to pay entire balance on all my credit cards including Walmart which I paid on June 18th to keep them clear and have them ready for the holidays. 1 month later a Credit Bureau alerts me Walmart closed my account asking if this was accurate. I never received a notice about my Walmart account being paid by the Credit Bureaus as they did all other cards congratulating me after those cards reported my payment. Walmart did not report mine with them as paid which helps my credit score. Instead Walmart alerted Bureaus that they made the choice to close out my account. That hurt my credit. I thought probably that I had not re-used the card again was the reason, although it had only been a month, so how could they close it for that. I contacted Walmart online to ask why and they said because I am no longer considered a holder with worthiness of their credit. I asked what does that mean and why? I was told first that I was wrong on live chat that the account was open and I said I just logged in and it says it has been closed I am looking right at it now, so right out of the gate they were getting their information incorrect. That person transferred me to another person and they said Walmart saw something on my credit report to another place that has nothing to do with them and decided I was no longer Worthy of their credit due to that information the credit bureau was giving them. They said it is their policy. They apologized for their decision. I asked, Doesn't credit history get considered prior to giving credit cards? I was given one and there was no issue then. I was worthy then but now that I have shown good payment history and finally paid every penny of it to bring total to $0 I am not worthy? I never received notice so they said notice is coming expect it in a few days. I was given a snipid of the letter online so I could see that is where I read the “Worthiness” line. Then the live chat rep has the audacity to tell me to keep up with my payments. WHAT? Will I be charged a monthly/yearly fee? For a card I am no longer to have? I think this is injust and unfair to a good long term consumer. Not that my issue will make or break Walmart so please no rolling of the eyes at my notice as just another complaint in the massive amount I know Walmart receives. Consider things and look at it as humans with good business sense. How discriminatory and ridiculous is this? As I informed a few co-workers they showed me their cards and history and it is awful and one showed me she paid hers off over 6 months ago and she is a single mom with horrible credit yet her credit and account is still active. What is the criteria that resulted in my results? I understand this Is final but would like express myself and not expect a standard stupid response that deep down as you write it to me you damn well know it is ridiculous. Had I not paid off in full and just made my minimum payments made your decision different? Then I could have kept my account? What is this Walmart? All other credit cards I paid off sent me thanks and one increased my credit limit. Walmart decides this? No one else cared what my history shows now they just know they get good money from me and they wish to continue getting good money from me. Disgusting, disgraceful, shameful, unfair and down-right dumb practices. Punish a consumer for what I might do in future based on what someone else said in a report. Something needs to be done to make sure this discriminatory practices do not continue.",0,1

Wallmart's employee did not accept the return of a new product to with receipt within five days of purchase, just because the box was open. Wallmart employee offered me to call the corporate number and provided me a phone number. I called this number and after 10 minutes of advertising, I was with an agent. The agent promissed me to help me with return. She started asking me my information (name, credit card, address) just for verification to help me with the return. at the end if our conversation, I was put on the automated machine where I was informed that I signed up for some shopping reward subscription. I started screaming that I don’t need a subscription, I just needed help with the return. The call was ""magically disconnected” while I was frustrated, with two children, one despiretely crying. Wallmart employee with his colleague was starring and laughing at me. I told him I'd write a complaint, he started showing his name tag , saying, ""Go ahead! I will be donating the mattresses, but I want everyone to know that they are poor low quality and the smell is suffocate, and in my case, the employee declined to proceed with return. “Intex 8.75"" Classic Downy Inflatable Airbed Mattress”. I will never ever buy anything from Walmart and I spread the world as much as I can about my terrible experience.",0,1

I called around to all the local stores to get a flat screen tv they had on clearance & was told this particular location had some. I called and had someone pull one behind the counter for me and told them I’m on my way. He told me the price was marked normal price but they would take it up to customer service and price match! I drive 45 minutes there and get it up front and the customer service manager named Denise was SO RUDE & NASTY! She said it’s $248....we can’t give it to you for the $149 clearance price! Well I showed her the tv that was on the Walmart app which said the brand and the size and looked identical. She said nope you can either purchase this tv for $248 or leave but we are not price matching! I asked for a manager and she said “I am the manager” so I asked for another manager! She gets Frances over there which was nicer but also refused to price match! Denise carts the tv and the tv mount I had back to the back behind electronics. I then ask for corporates number! They call the assistant manager and get them to come talk to me. We do some more research and the $248 tv was the ultra hd so the associate pulled the wrong one out to hold for me. So I said ok just get me the correct tv for $149! Then they say they don’t have any! Well on the app it says they have 3 in stock! They still argue with me saying maybe I could get it somewhere else online but not there! So I add it to the cart through the app and pay for it and it clearly said pick up at their location! So at this point I already bought it so where’s the tv?! They search everywhere in the back and find an open box returned tv, it was missing the manual but they gave me $15 off which I tuned around and used on the 2 year protection plan and I also bought the $80 mount. They make me pay for the tv again and tell me to cancel my online order. I was there for 2 hours from 6:30-8:30pm!!!! To top it all off.....My car was hit in the parking lot and the car just took off! So now I spoke with Bob the store manager to look at the security cameras to find who did it and he said I have to file a police report and they have to request to see them. Now I have to pay my $500 deductible to fix my car!!!! Expensive trip to Walmart!!! I think I’ll stay away from there!!!!!!!!!

Walmart,Poor customer service,"We were at Walmart automotive department in Kernersville North Carolina helping father-in-law(85 yrs old) get his car serviced. He bought two new tires from Walmart a couple months ago and one of the tires went flat. There seem to be a lot of confusion about what service he needed and what service he actually came to get. He called us, confused and frustrated. It seemed to be a miscommunication on his part as well as the Service department. He had been waiting for a little over three hours. When we got there we explain the situation and decided to shop while waiting for the repairs to be completed. I’ve been watching the prices on a product, the Blackstone Griddle grill. I was shocked to see the sign said the new low price $247. I asked the cashier for help and he agreed with me that was the new price and that they had sold a few of them this past weekend due to the new low price . At that time I told the cashier I wanted one new in the box, and he said he had to get the price and someone to take it down off of the shelf. The young lady who assisted said she had to scan it and she got a latter and the first cashier scan the barcode. Cashier number two told me that the price was not 247 and she would have to talk to her manager to see what could be done. She said “he may not give it to you at that price but he’ll probably offer you 25% off“. The other cashier insisted that he would have to give it to me at the price that was on the sale ticket. Meanwhile I didn’t really care I just told my husband that I really wanted the grill. I had pretty much made up in my mind that we were going to buy it until the sales manager came over to assess the situation( there was no situation). He basically said clearly The Grill was in the wrong place and at the wrong sales tag was displayed. The 247 sales price was not meant for the Blackstone, but I should have assumed the sales tag for the Cuisinart grill sign was the right price for the Blackstone grill?!?!? At that time he was not willing to honor the advertise price nor any discount . At that time I made up in my mind that I would not buy the grill at all. Primarily due to him judging me as a opposed to trying to remedy the fact that it was “falsely advertised” and their signage was very misleading. No apology at all, and as a matter fact he just walked away after he instructed cashier number two to remove the sign that was up above the grill and put the right price, and went on to something else outside in the lawn and garden area. This was definitely the POOREST CUSTOMER service I have ever experienced. Kenny, the department manager judge me as opposed to the situation. Some people may have become irate and disgruntled, but instead I walked out to the lawn and garden area where he was puttering around, and again I asked “if he wasn’t going to honor the sale price what would he be willing to do“. He said ”Nothing” I know Walmart has policies regarding advertise pricing and honoring it. In this case it had nothing to do with honoring it, it was based on who he was willing to honoring it for. To summarize my review, I think that it’s fair to say Some management at Walmart has a very biased opinion on honoring Walmart policies and practices.",0,1

Walmart,Worst customer service ever!!,"Worst customer service ever!!! People not working, but standing around clueless at the CUSTOMER SERVICE desk...where do you hire your staff at??? If the GM needs a secret shopper call me, but be ready to give me some pink slips to hand out! It took me 30 mins to check out. I walked in, gave a employee my Walmart bag with 2 pairs of pants and a receipt to exchange. Came back to the counter on 5 mins and nobody can find the bag or do they give a crap about finding it. I distinctly heard the lady that helped me first brief the young man as to my situation as she was going to do something else. He looked at me as if I was speaking French, then started to back talk me as I explained to a manager what was going on. We had to find the initial lady! Your managers cannot teach your staff to care. Do you not screen individuals during the interview process??? Your process is broken!!! Very broken...shame on you Walmart!!!",0,1

I then purchased an item online only to find out that I needed to send it back at the time of the return I only received a receipt showing that I have returned the item. their refund option was to have an e-card emailed out to me. ALL 3 times they sent one out only for it to not work. I informed them that I will not be accepting any more e-cards due to the lack of success in TRYING to use it even to the point of printing a copy for them to scan. They said that they will put the refund on the original payment form which is a physical gift card, not an e-card, however, they mean e-card, not a physical gift card. Again I will not accept this form of a refund due to the hassle of it not working the 3 previous times. This is not how a customer should be treated at all. Lack of customer service skills I have noticed is becoming a problem. People are not being trained adequately. I will follow up with a small claim due to the lack of customer service on many occasions. A supervisor told me that she would put a gift card in the mail, however, did not do so, according to an agent at Walmart. What a LIAR. Not appreciated and there was no reason to tell a customer a lie. You should be ashamed of telling customer such bs and lies.",0,1

Yet they are telling me that one has to be shipped there and won't be ready to pick up for 3 to 4 days. I am here out of town right now and cannot cancel it because the phone was paid for and bought for me for my boss for work and he is now out of the country. If I would have known that pickup today did not mean pick up today or even the next I would have been fine with then I would have never ordered it. Can't stand lieing and deceptive companies. And this Walmart on Bells Ferry in Woodstock Georgia is one of them. I spoke with a manager and they told me even though they have the phone there they cannot go and give me the phone from my pick up today that I paid for because of their inventory. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Why do you call it pick up today when it doesn't mean pick up today or even the next. I will never shop at this Walmart again or probably no other. Definitely will not be ordering anything from there so called pick up today service. And it doesn't tell you anything about that when you placed the order, so you think that you're picking up an order today when it says that. You're probably not so please don't get screwed like me and place an order for pick up today. DECEITFUL COMPANY AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.",0,1

Walmart,Treated Like a Criminal,"I'm a regular customer at Walmart. I go at least 5 times a week. Today, because it was raining when I approached the doors to leave, I hovered around the area to wait for the rain to slow down. A Walmart worker, whom I've spoken to personally at least 4 times, asked to see my receipt. She then proceeded to pull all of my items out, and scan them to check to see if I had stolen anything. It took forever. I hate being treated like this. It's not like I had a big screen TV that wasn't bagged up. I'm sorry that a few people steal, but treating some of your customers like criminals is insulting and embarrassing. It ruined my shopping experience. This is not Sam's Club, where people walk out without bagged items. There has to be a better way, Walmart.",0,1

No such luck. Scanned everything and the machine is stuck. Calling out for help does nothing. Another customer went to summon help and found it but it got sidetracked. Meanwhile everybody's waiting. And waiting. Only one CS to help? No kidding!!Finally she came and unstuck the register, I packed my purchase and off on my merry way. Their plastic bags are trash, extremely thin, rip on demand and difficult to open while hanging from a hook of sorts. By contrast, I just went through a self register at a local Dave's supermarket, and this one worked like a clockwork. Scanned all my groceries, packed, paid and that's it. No help necessary; but if it was needed, it was right there. Walmart sure could benefit from taking a few lessons at Dave's.Bottom Line: will never buy anything online from Walmart and don't recommend. As far as in-store purchase, will never use a self register and will probably start using my own shopping bags. End of story.",0,2

Walmart,"Yeah, Walmart Really Does Suck!","So Walmart began as 'quality' American-made products, lowest price guarantees & smiling greeters at the door. Now? Understocked shelves with 1 or 2, mostly crap-brands and walmart-store brand. Many exact products can be found at biglots/aldi, etc for MUCH less. Most stuff's made in China. They've replaced those smiling greeters with door cops. I only go occasionally for a few small products that fit in bags. Last week, I went & bought 8 smaller items including 3 small bags of potting soil. Requested the angry looking clerk, to bag everything so I wasn't stopped/held up by the door cops. She refused to bag up, 1 bag of soil stating,she didn't have a bag it would fit in. Stopped by the 2 door cops, who repeatedly scanned that $4 bag of soil as the scan gun repeatedly, loudly beeped. Other customers piled up behind me. Embarrassed & in a hurry, I stated, ""Ma'm, I am not a thief"". Door cop allowed me to leave. After getting home, I looked at receipt. That 1 item, the nasty clerk had refused to bag up? It was NOT on the receipt! Altho, I couldn't prove it, I feel that nasty clerk tried to set me up, to get busted as a shoplifter! Imagine, being arrested, fined,perhaps jailed with your name in the newspapers for stealing DIRT!!! I called the local store, asked to speak to management & explained issue. She was very cordial & when I told her, I'd be in with receipt to pay for that little bag of dirt, she said, don't bother wasting my time & theirs. I'm writing this to warn others of what can happen. If your checkout clerk's having a bad day, doesn't like the way you look or is just a general jerk, they can easily set you up for arrest & great humiliation. Since, I've stopped doing the majority of my shopping at walmart, I get better quality items for much less by going to ALDI, BigLots, farmer's markets, online shops and our local grocery store(sales). Yet, our local walmart, parking lot still seems full most of the time. Why is that? Many people claim, to hate walmart yet still shop there. I learned my lesson well with that last experience. I swear, I'll never shop at a walmart ever again. We also recently had a terrible & humiliating experience in the pharmacy (do they care that they've lost 3 pharma customers? Probably not) I wonder, how many people will get nailed for shoplifting because their clerk didn't ring up the only item, they refused to bag up?",0,1

Meaning, you cant cancel your order with WalMart. Next, I contacted WalMart customer service to see if they could cancel it with a guarantee or update the address. I was informed to wait 48 hrs, even though the packages were to be delivered in that same time frame. So I then decided to update the addresse or hold at a FedEx location through FedEx. Here I was informed that the shipper, WalMart, put restrictions on shipping so they were unable to do anything. Then, I decided to call WalMart to have them change the address through FedEx. They informed me all they could do is add a note with the new address. If there were issues with delivery to the wrong address FedEx would call WalMart and get the new address. First, this is WalMart, so I was not expecting stellar service. However, I can't believe they're not able to cancel an order before it has shipped. Second, I work for a company that ships product out and as long as the package is not on its way to the final destination, it's a pretty good chance the address can be changed or it can be held at a FedEx location.This may not mean a lot but I won't be shopping at Walmart again.",0,1

Walmart,Went to the Walmart on Sanderson in…,"Went to the Walmart on Sanderson in Hemet CA to get a tire replaced. My husband checked with them the day before to make sure they had the tire size we needed and they told him they opened at 7a the next day. We arrived at 655a and got our car in line. Cars were lining up behind us but they hadn’t opened yet. At 730a myself and another lady starting calling the store to see if there was a problem. No answer, it just rang for about 3 minutes then disconnected. We both called 10 times and same result. Finally around 8a I walked around to the front of the store and asked for a manager. A girl said she was the front end manager. I asked about the auto shop. She said they don’t open until 8a. I said the sign in the door says 7a. She walked away from me. So I walked to the interior auto department and found the manager. He said most of his staff didn’t show up, only one mechanic. At this point he and the mechanic opened the bay doors and advised everyone that it would take one hour per car and they would start with me since I was there first. They wrote me up and took my keys. I went inside to shop. After an hour I returned to the auto shop and my car had not been touched. Now their story was they cannot change a tire without a second mechanic on the premises pee California state law. I verified this and it is not true. At this point I’d been there 2 and a half hours so just said give me my keys, I’m done. They were rude and unprofessional. Laughing at the customers who were all upset at this point. A women who said she was the shop assistant manager showed up and instigated all kinds of anger amongst the customers that were still there. I went to take a photo of her name tag so I wouldn’t forget her name and she completely flipped out of me. Started yelling at me that it was illegal to take a video. I said oh, I wasn’t taking a video but I will now. She completely lost it. She put her hand up to block my phone. It was crazy! I finally got my keys and left. I called to register a complaint with Walmart customer service. They advised the the store general manager would call me in 3 days. I waited 2 weeks and no call so I contacted them back. I was advised that my behavior was inappropriate so he refused to call me. Inappropriate? For taking a video? Don’t ever do business here. I for one will never shop at any Walmart again",0,1

Walmart,Unsatisfied Customer,"Last night at 11:30PM I found a squat rack that was a 'roll back'. I attempted to purchase this on walmart.com several times last night but every time I clicked proceed to checkout I would receive an error message. Now it was late and there was no timer that I could see that would indicate the squat rack offer would expire, so I figured I would go to bed and order them in the morning. Well this morning (6 and a half hours later) I go on to order them and the squat racks are no longer 'roll back', increasing the cost by 10 bucks. I then contacted customer support hoping to receive the previous pricing since it was less than 24 hours old. The representative informed me that Walmart prices go up and down and to check back later because Walmart could not honor previous prices... First of all, I have dumped thousands of dollars into Walmart over the years and have had mostly decent experiences. For such a large Organization to not honor their own prices is ridiculous. I've heard several other stores have honored previous pricing in situations like this, but I suppose that's because they value customers. Second, I am not the kind of person that enjoys messing around with price watching. When I need something I need it, and don't have time to sit and see what happens. After this experience I plan to still get these squat racks, but I will most likely purchase them on Amazon. I'm sure nothing will happen because of this review, but I just want people to be aware in the event you see a product that is considered a 'roll back'.",0,1

Called Walmart again and now they tell me the freight company inventoried it but somehow forgot to put it on the truck, 5 days later I get the last box. Now Guess what the filter is broken. So I call Walmart again and I’m told to basically return all items because they can’t replace the filter because it’s a bundle set. No no no. So next Supervisor tells me to re-order the same filter and when it comes put the broken one in the box and tell them it was damaged and that would take two days to come so I ordered this on Monday, June 3 it says two day Shipping and will arrive Thursday, June 6 ,so Thursday comes no filter and my pool is sitting filled with 13,000 gallons of water that’s just sitting there and it’s gonna start to change colors I have no pool filter contact Walmart and there’s apparently nothing they can do , they gave me a 25 $ gift card, and re-order me another filter that won’t arrive until Tuesday that’s not sufficient enough they told me that UPS lost the item they can’t find the item but this is the second time that Walmart has disappointed me every time I call customer service someone is lying to me telling me a different story of where my items are.

Walmart,Angry Customer,"Below is the email I sent directly to Walmart and their response. I ordered from my company and have ordered as many as 150 items at a time so their response is not acceptable.I recently ordered 100 water bottles for my company on line at a cost of $12.73 each. 2 days after my order was placed I received an email you were out of stock and my order was cancelled. I do not believe you were out of stock because your web-site did not show out of stock the day I ordered them. I believe you cancelled my order because the day after I ordered these I went to the web-site to print a picture of the water bottle to show our VP/General Manager and the price of the bottle was $30.63 each. I couldn't believe the price changed that much in 1 day. I think that is why you cancelled my order and that is very sorry on your part. I will be posting this review in as many places as I can on social media to show just how sorry Walmart is. You should honor my order and send me my water bottles. When I ordered the water bottles it didn’t show only 6 were available. And how could the price more than double in one day. Walmart Response:I'd like to comment you that sometimes, items may change it's price from one day to another and orders don't get cancelled. However, due to the amount of items, your order could be fulfilled and was cancelled as the inventory wasn't enough. At this moment, only 6 items are available based on the information in our website. I'd also like to comment you that if you'd like to place a new order, please do not add more than 10 of the same items in the same order. This is just to avoid the issue of your order being cancelled again.",0,1

Walmart,Do not ever believe a review left on…,"Do not ever believe a review left on Walmart, they are the worst site in the world for fake reviews.. not only are they fake but they front load all the fake ones so people stop reading after a few reviews cuz they think it's so great. It's a trick to try to make you stop reading review so you don't get to the negative ones The ways you can spot fake reviews. First, the average person does not feel compelled to sign on line, sign on to a website, go through the process of clicking several things to get to the review site to leave a positive review because they're already content and happy with what they bought. The overwhelming number of people who leave reviews would naturally leave negative ones because they're mad. Fake reviews are easy to spot by the overuse of exclamation points!! nobody leaves exclamation points when they're happy. I believe Walmart actually pays people to leave fake reviews on purpose. As soon as you see exclaimation points, Dismiss it immediately as a fake review ..also when they use the products full name and or product number that's a fake review.. when they go overboard in raving about the product for like three paragraphs it's fake... the vast majority of reviews on Walmart or completely made up.do not believe them",0,1

I helped her do her job by handing the box to her so I could place the rest of my items on the belt. I guess she was annoyed because then a large white man in street clothes came to the end cap of the checkout and he clearly said they dont want to see me mad I guess he was trying to intimidate me a paying customer and a woman to which I paid him no mind because he looked homeless to be honest nothing about him looked like he worked there except for his ignorant arrogant attitude with no uniform.

If that the employee LOOKED at the receipt first there would be no need to open my factory sealed box and perhaps I could sell it to recoup some my of my loss. I started to call Walmart Customer Care on April 26 and was told someone would call me back.. I repeated this process for 3 1/2 weeks before I got a manager who called me back and told me to bring the laptop back and he would refund my money. I was to go to the store between the hours of 12 noon and 10pm when he was working... I was so happy! I went back to Walmart on May 24 at 12:30pm only to be told by now a different manager (because the manager that was suppose to be there and give me a refund was not there) that there would be no return because the manger that called me back made a mistake! WHAT!!?? I started to speak and was cut off by this manger, who did not even look at me, that he was NOT taking the computer back and if I wanted to wait to talk to the manager that told me to bring it back for a refund I could wait but he had no idea when he would be in. I CAN NOT EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW STRESSFUL AND WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME THIS ALL WAS.. ONLY TO LEAVE THE STORE YET AGAIN WITH MY LAPTOP! I JUST CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW I WAS TREATED!!! EVEN WALMART CUSTOMER CARE CORPORATE DID NOT EVEN HELP ME OR EVEN SEEM TO EVEN CARE!! I do not know any store with a 15 day return policy but even with that said I deserved to walk out of that store with a factory sealed box the way I walked in!! The employee did not do her job! If she had looked at that receipt before opening my box she would have seen that I was on day 16 and missed the ridiculous 15 day return window by 24 hours!!!! I WAS TREATED TERRIBLY FROM THE STORE EMPLOYEES TO THE STORE MANAGERS TO CORPORATE WALMART CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I RESENT BEING TOLD THAT I COULD BRING IT BACK FOR A REFUND ONLY TO GO BACK AND BE PUT THROUGH THAT WHOLE ORDEAL AGAIN! I FEEL WALMART OWES ME A HUGE APOLOGY FOR THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME, STRESS AND THE DISRESPECT THEY PUT ME THROUGH ONLY BECAUSE I CHOSE TO BUY FROM THEIR STORE! I REPEAT>>> I WAS TREATED TERRIBLY!!! HOW DARE YOU TAKE MY FACTORY SEALED LAPTOP AND GIVE ME BACK AN OPEN BOX!!! I AM FURIOUS AND I INTEND TO TELL ANYONE THAT WILL LISTEN WHAT I WENT THROUGH AT YOUR STORE!",0,1

Walmart,Another example of Walmart's lack of customer care and downhill slide.,"Guess others already knew but I found out out why Walmart (at least locally and probably elsewhere) very often doesn't have popular items. When something sells very well, the store manager removes it from the store to please that brand's competitors and try to ""force"" customers to buy the competitor brands which hadn't been doing as well. As a result, Walmart warehouse thinks that the former high sales volume item is no longer popular since the store is no longer ordering it so they stop buying it or reduce their orders drastically. Another example of Walmart ignoring the customer and trying to control the market, while many customers simply stop going to Walmart in favor of other retail stores. This is stupid as well since it reduces Walmart's profits that could have been earned from the high volume sales while it earns Walmart a very negative image and lost customers.",0,1

Walmart,Never buy a gift card from walmart.com,"I just got off a chat with Walmart.com customer service and have to warn everyone about their ineptitude. I ordered an ""e"" birthday gift card for my grandson on walmart.com, 2 days before his birthday. I was in the UK and he lives in Colorado so I couldn't be there. He loves to buy toys at the local Walmart store, so thought this is the perfect long-distance gift. The card was to be delivered via email to my daughter's account. We've done this many times before successfully with other websites like Amazon. The Walmart.com website said the card was delivered about 4 hours after I placed the order. But my daughter never received it. She's very tech-savvy and knows about Junk and Spam and how to find stuff. We waited and waited, and after two days, still no card. So I was forced to buy another gift. The next day I contacted Customer ""Care"" (ha-ha) via the Chat tool. The nice agent told me that she would resend the gift card email. I said, no thanks, a bit late I already bought something else and just want a refund. Since it wasn't delivered, surely you can just cancel the card number. No we can't, she replied. But I'll escalate this to our gift card team who will contact you in 48 hours. They never contacted me. So I tried again. The very nice agent this time said we don't ever give refunds on gift card purchases. But she'd be glad to resend the gift card. Again, no that's not what we want. We want a refund. Or we'd settle for a voucher we could use on the website again. So she sends us a voucher good for the gift card amount. but it says we first have to spend an additional $45 at Walmart! Unbelievable. I ask, can you change the email address and just send the card to me, maybe I can use it. She says, sorry we cannot change the email address after the order. Wow.So here is why you should never buy an e-gift card from Walmart.com: 1. If it's not delivered or received, you have no recourse. You're screwed. End of story.2. Delivering an e-card today is such a simple operation at every other website. But something is wrong with the Walmart.com system and they're not admitting it. I'm not the first to complain. 3. Their Customer Service chat tool is strange, compared to others. Firstly, there are no time stamps anywhere. I guess so you can't tell how long you've waited or been on with them. 2nd, there is no way to Print or Save a transcript of the chat. I had to manually copy and paste. Why doesn't Walmart want us to save a copy of the chat??4. If you are angry enough, they will try to buy you off with a coupon that requires you to spend more money in order to get your refund! That's insulting. Shoulda bought from Amazon.",0,1

Walmart,I must shop in an electric cart merely…,"I must shop in an electric cart merely to get through Walmart. So, there I am in the electric cart, clearly disabled, tired, and needing to locate and buy a peppermint plant for IBS medical purposes. There is a large, well stocked plant department I am in the indoor section and have no idea whether they have peppermint plants or where they would be. I approach the employee at the exterior door and ask if they carry them. He asks the employee at the only cash register near the door who, without missing a beat, says they don't carry them. As I prepare to exit the store and go through the outside garden section to the parking lot, what do I see on a shelf next to the door? A shelf with herbs. There, right on the edge of the shelf, clearly labeled, is one peppermint plant. It is the only one on the shelf, in poor condition, but at least it is there. I grab it, return to the cash register and point out that they DO carry it and inquire why nobody bothered to go and look for me. This goes unanswered and neither of the two male employees looks concerned. I ask them to reduce its' price, given it is half or more dead, but I'm willing to take a chance on it and am too tired to go elsewhere to shop. They have to call a third employee to determine if the price should be reduced. I tell her about their lack of checking the shelf for me. She isn't concerned either, but reduces the price appropriately. Service to the disabled community is sorely lacking at this Walmart store which I have repeatedly complained about to its' management.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart Store Management/ April 21,"Walmart Store Management/ April 21, 2019 We had a bad experience as customers in Walmart Center at Gibsonton dr in Florida. We do most of our shopping at Walmart. Yes, Walmart is known for been open 24 hours and having the lowest prices and also for price matching. Let me go back to the beginning. We when to Walmart to buy some groceries including my Son getting new Sox and tennis shoes for the gym. My daughter is also looking at getting a Mountain bike so we could go hiking and trail riding here in Florida. We are moving to a new house and we want to get shower rods for both bathroom and shower curtain. In the middle of this/ we decided to buy a new vacuum that could do both tiles and carpet. Are old vacuum only does carpet. My in-laws just got this new shark vacuum and it works great. At that moment we decided (Let’s get a shark vacuum) well we look and found the one we wanted. Unfortunately the boxes of inventory for that particular vacuum where out. We noticed they had another vacuum for $200/ the same price range of the one we where looking at buying. So we When on to pay for everything we needed. This is where the customer service When very wrong and impolite. At the register we explained to the lady at the self paying aisle. This vacuum (Shark Rotation Lift away) that is normally $279 plus tax is mark down at $199 plus tax. Can you please adjust the price. She When to talk to another register/ the manager came about and said/ this is the original price. We told Him... is mark down. In reality we where not looking at getting this vacuum/ but the one we wanted was NOT in stock. Well he said I could check for you to see if we have any more in our wear house. We insist/ We have a picture of the label. Your sample vacuum is above the boxes we pick and the label clearly stated that is mark down in price. He explained that it was their error/ someone had forgotten to remove the label of a sale they had the week before. I said/ How is this our fouls? Whether it was us or the next person/ the vacuum was labeled at $199. At this point we where very disappointment with the treatment we got by the lady in the cash register and the unpleasant manager. We are NOT stilling merchandise. We are regular customers/ buying at Walmart on a daily basis. Walmart Employees should NOT think everyone who walks to their cashier is looking to take advantage of the situation. Explain to me how is it our fouls that they forget to remove a price tag from the weekend before. I will never give them my business. I will purchase on line or Amazon but will NEVER buy at their location again.",0,1
Walmart,"I buy from Walmart, but......","I buy from Walmart because they are close and usually have the best prices. HOWEVER -- for the past 3 years, there is always at least one items I need that is out of stock on every trip. They are constantly restocking, crowding the isles with boxes, but either they quit carrying the item (example: fire logs in March when it is still chilly in the midwest and people use them year round for campfires.) or it's still in the back. I have been told that when an item sells out it is automatically reordered. So why couldn't I purchase a specific, very popular flavor of Gatorade or any brand of meat tenderizer for weeks? Who knows. Also, the store is very disorganized and dirty. Chicken bones left in the clothing, trash in the shopping carts, on the floor, in the parking lot. Items not where they should be. And, then there's the rude employees -- must not like working there. The handicapped carts are rarely available because they are broken, not charged or being played with by children whose parent don't seem to care.

Walmart,Walmart.com Order Online for in-store pickup? DON'T! UP-date,"On 13 April 2019, I ordered, for in-store pickup, same day, 2 items and PAID for them! I was told they'd be available that evening. Ah... that evening instead of receiving the ""Come and get it"" e-mail, I got a ""Sorry. Your items will be ready tomorrow (14 April) after 6pm."" OK. Fine. But wait... On 14 April at 5:30pm I received no word that my items were in the local store so I contacted Walmart.com ""chat"" customer service. THEY told me that ONE of my items was ready for pick-up, the other (which I'd been assured was in stock in the store) wouldn't be available for ""3-10 business days""! Oh? Well, fine. I told ""Customer Service"" to cancel the entire order, issue a refund. Fine.I went to the local store anyway, thinking I might be able to find substitute items because I NEEDED the merchandise. At the store, the very store where I was supposed to pick-up my order, there were BOTH items, on the racks, ready for the taking & purchasing! Being on a clock, I made the purchase of the items, assured that I'd receive a full refund (as I was told by ""Ana C. & Lizzie M."" of ""Customer Service Chat"") I was satisfied.Not! On 19 April, 2019, a check of my account showed that it took FIVE days to get HALF of my money back! Ana C., Lizzie M. Eric-something, yes THREE of Walmart's crack ""Customer Service"" folks cancelled only ONE item. And Walmart took the money for the other item! So now I've dealt with ""Alexander"" who informs me that ANOTHER refund has been arranged and THAT will now take ANOTHER 5 ""business days"". Oh, and while I was in the store making my purchase on the 14th, an ""Associate"" at the store informed me that this is common, because the sales people are ""just to lazy to go get the items"". The nice youngster with whom I spoke, on premises, told of an incident where a ""Manager"" simply checked a hand-held device for a customer asking for an item and dismissed the customer with a ""Nope. We don't have any."" Meanwhile, the ""Associate"", on her rounds, noticed a full stock on the sales floor.Moral of this saga: NEVER TRUST WALMART on-line or in-store. If you truly NEED an item and want it from Walmart, go yourself. Nobody is to be trusted. As for your money? All it takes is a ""click"" to lose it. IF you're lucky enough to ever see it again, plan on it being held to the benefit of Walmart for at least 10 days.They're thieves, plain and simple. It takes one ""click"" for them to take your money, they sit on it, benefiting from it for 2 ""business weeks"" and MAYBE you'll get it back... eventually, if you're lucky.

ALL 6 times, I got to the store to find that, not only did they not have the quantity, they didn't have ANY. To my face (in NY and VT) the sales person lied, straight-faced claiming ""Oh... those go fast."" and ""I didn't talk to you so I don't know what you're complaining about."" and ""I don't know who told you we had them."" For the stores in SC, my relatives made special trips to go to the stores & got, pretty much, the same disrespect. I've spoken with the managers in the Williston VT, Ticonderoga NY and one store in SC and every time I got the same ""I'm SO sorry. I'll put in the order for you & call you when they come in."" 6 months later, no call from the store, so when I called THEM back I got ""That must have been the other manager."" and ""I don't know when they'll be in again."" and the one in Williston VT had the audacity to tell me ""You can pay for them now & we'll call you when they come in."" Meanwhile, I've gone shopping at Amazon. Couldn't be happier.",0,1

Yesterday I went to the same store to get more but the lady behind the counter said that they aren't selling perfume in stores anymore, and that I have to buy it online. I went online and low and behold they now want $14 more for it. My question is this1. If you have never tried it before, how do you know you will like it. Some perfumes smell different on everybody. 2. If I want to shop online, I will but, I refuse to let some 2nd rate store ram it down my throat. 3.

Walmart,This review is for Walmart.com,"This review is for Walmart.com ordering online from Walmart doesn’t mean the items are from Walmart. Most of the items are from private sellers. I find this very annoying because they don’t reflect Walmart pricing or shipping practices. Recently ordered 2 dolls from website and paid shipping. Fine. I received my items 2 weeks apart even though purchased same day because from two different sellers. Ok Fine whatever. But why pay shipping when you order a supposedly brand new undamaged Doll and then recieve damaged packaging because gets sent in envelope instead of box. There isn’t a way to communicate to the sellers so I can’t even request box shipping. Seriously though I sell toys and dolls online, but I would never compromise the integrity of a brand new item, especially a Doll in the Soft plastic & paper boxes they come in by sending it in an envelope. Again why charge me the fees if it’s not going to be properly protected during shipping? And why isn’t there a way to communicate to the individual sellers selling under the Walmart online store? It’s upsetting to pay for a full price item and have it be a crap shoot if it arrives in full price condition or damaged condition.",0,1

The guy who answered at customer service told me that the tires were out of stock and they could not be gotten.

I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone for a senior resolutions specialist to tell me that the guy who didn't speak english I was originally routed to, had canceled my order instead of getting me a set from a different manufacturer that were in stock.Now I have to get rides or borrow a car for the next 3-5 days while I wait for my credit to buy tires from someone else.I plan to post this review everywhere I can in order to protect others from the same issue.

I regret I didn't read the many bad reviews of Walmart Vision Center eye care Service. Long story short after spent money on the Store optometrist's prescription, and waiting 3 weeks for the glasses, it came out all wrong, the first time I put them on I couldn't read signs across the store it was all blare out, I been told I have to get use to them for couple weeks, well, it was all a 'get around' excuse. I end up not wearing the new glasses. I will never do business with Walmart Optical again. You should never try to bargain when it comes to your eye care.

It turned out that they misinterpreted my actions captured on store camera and thought that I stole a piece of underwear. What I actually did was measure the underwear in store against my own which I brought from home. Is this illegal? I had the same underwear ON ME at the moment when I was detained, how is this possible that I have same underwear as in my pocket, if I stole it? Is it magic or I'm just innocent? I bought SEVEN underpants and for some reason ""stole"" an additional one? Walmart doesn't even have this brand! I am an immigrant and I don't know US sizes yet. Or is this discrimination based on my nationality that I, a law abiding person, was detained? I was searched, camera footage was examined only to find out they were wrong about the accusation. The woman said: ""You put underwear in your pocket, DON'T DO THAT"". I'm sorry, is this illegal to put my own stuff into my pocket? No, I'll do whatever I want if it's not against the law, period. A law abiding person doesn't constantly have to behave in a way not to raise suspicion in people who can't study camera footage properly before making accusations. Presumption of innocence anyone? Then the police officer said: ""If you commit a crime, your visa will be revoked"". Well, somehow I already knew that, but why do I need to listen to this? Did I do anything wrong? Is there any evidence? No, so why are you telling this to a random person? Why do you give me so much stress out of thin air when I'm just going about my business? Did you know, officer, that if YOU commit a crime, you will go to jail? Oh you knew that? Ok, I'm just telling you this because I want to, lol. Then i was told I was free to go. I got no apology.

Walmart,This is for Walmart.com only,"This is for Walmart.com only, not their brick and mortar stores. Pricing on walmart.com is usually pretty good and even better than in store prices sometimes. They only get two stars however because of their awful search engine and website. Search results often are bizzare! You might do a very specific search for a single item like a tool and get underwear in the results. In addition, they show in store products that are supposedly available but usually aren't and in most cases items appear that are in store but they won't show prices! That's just pointless and frustrating. The pickup desk in stores is often unattended but the clerks do a good job. Also, with many products the selection of items on walmart.com is surprisingly limited when you specify only walmart as a seller. That seems crazy for a giant retailer like walmart. They are often overrun by other retailers selling items on their website similar to the way amazon has ""marketplace"" sellers giving the buyer more choices to buy from someone else than walmart. (I only buy from walmart as seller for safety and warranty reasons). I reluctantly use walmart.com sparingly as it's just not well organized and the offerings are slim in some cases startling so.

Walmart,Savings Catcher Discounts GONE!  BEWARE CONSUMERS!,"Now Walmart is taking away Savings Catcher. Last fall you had to use Walmart Pay in order to use it. I used to saves a lot of money when I brought the ads in. Walmart is a socialist company. Forgive this analogy: You fill a trough with slop and the wild pigs will start coming to eat. You build one side of the fence because the pigs are so happy they have free food. Every time they come to the cheap prices, you build another side of the fence until eventually you have the pigs all caged in. They never knew what was happening. This is what Walmart has done. Made it virtually impossible for other grocery stores to survive. For those people who agree with our laws about illegals, Walmart is one of large corporations, along with our federal government, that have made it so illegals do not have to learn to speak the language. I am offended that Walmart started putting Spanish on all of their food items just to make more money.

Walmart,BLIND LEADING THE BLIND!!!,"I have been shopping at the Walmart in Montgomery, Texas for over eight years, since I moved to the area. It has been consistently getting worse over the years, especially since the new Kroger opened a few years ago right down 105. The apathy among the employees is getting so pathetic it is ridiculous. I do not know if it is the low IQ of management, the majority of the employees, or most probably both! I was there this morning looking for a health supplement, and after spending ten minutes not being able to find it, as stocking in alphabetical order seems to be above the stockers mental ability, I asked an employee in that department if he could find it. He looked for about five minutes, and seemed perplexed as a deer in the headlights. I then asked him if he could find out if they even carried the supplement. After he played on his phone for another five minutes, he still did not know. I then asked the pharmacy employees, and their response was "" it should be over there if we carry it"". I then went up front to speak with the manager, and when I asked a lady watching the check out lines, she informed me she was a front manager, whatever that is. She did not know either, and tried to find it on her phone, to no avail! Disgusted with this store and it's employees I walked out. Magically HEB had it in stock, exactly where it should have been, in alphabetical order....

Walmart,Walmart have loss respect from many,"Honestly This company have lack of heart since Sam Walton passed away, its like nobody cares, cash registers are lacking people to assist customers, especially if they have 13 available and only 2 are open for about 30 people per line to check out. The laywaway program should never been fully eliminated, plus all the charity programs Walmart once over seen no longer exist. How can this be, when it used to be a place where everybody once had a since of pride when shopping there. Walmart needs to bring the heart back and show Sam Walton that together his retail can gain respect from people who truly love shopping at this retail store.",0,1

Walmart,Always the cheapest for some items,"When I need toiletries or non-perishable food, or pretty much anything I'd buy at the grocery store, I always find it cheapest here.

They could only offer a compromise that increased my cost to an acceptable level. While I could not purchase the original item that allowed different degrees of adjustment, they did offer a similar item that had set adjustment levels. I have ordered and if not satisfied, will return as it is not the item initially desired.",0,1

Walmart,Wal mart store as a whole really I have…,"Wal mart store as a whole really I have no problems with. The issue lies in the employees in my opinion. I have never gone into a wal mart store and immediately thought to myself ""okay this store has something good going for them"". There are employees wandering around the store no matter what hour of the day, not really doing anything but maybe checking their phones. One could stand looking at the shelf with the most helpless confused look and it would be a miracle if they asked if you need help. Often times going up to the employee and asking for something does nt get you further than a point and an oh it's over there behind that I think, I really don't know. Ok I'll just find what I'm looking for on my own, I have no reason to be in and out in a timely manner, I have no other life obligations than being in this god forsaken store. Besides that, the customer service and money centers. Oh. My. God. There's so many employees walking around playing grab as, but yet no matter if the line at customer service or money center is 18 miles long will they have 2 people working the counter. There is at least 5 computers in any one of the centers ive been in, never more than 1 being used. Going to return that POS speaker you bought at wal mart?

Money does not return and there is no order either.",0,1
Walmart,Can't deliver orders and refuse to help,"Furnace went out the day before -30 temps were forecast (we hit -31), ordered a space heater for in-store pickup today, showed they had 5 left in stock. Nobody pulled my order and it went out of stock. The only ""assistance"" they would provide is ""Would you like me to cancel the order?"" There was a skid of them at another store a few miles away. They didn't check for me, just canceled the order and wished me luck with the record low temps. Had to purchase one from the other store and wait 5 days for the hold on my funds to be released. Also lost my online purchase rebate I would have got on the original order. Next I ordered a battery charger/air compressor for a road trip I was planning. They had an offer of $39.99, but when I clicked it the price showed as $49.13. I redid the search, and the $39.99 offer showed again. I took screenshots of this, then clicked again to see $49.13 again. Ordered it for delivery to the store for 2 day pick up, so I would have it before my trip, never arrived. Now they're saying it will be there 5 days later. When I contacted ""customer service"" I got nothing but pre-scripted replies with no effort to resolve the issue. After reading 3 pages of the reviews here I see that the only reason they have 2 stars is due to a bunch of obviously shilled 4-5 star reviews. And never get a pre-paid Via debit card from them, it is impossible to contact a live person if there is an issue. If you go online they only have ""suggestions"" as to how you're probably doing something wrong, and if you call the number on the back of the card you get into an endless automated system that has no option to speak to a live person, and hangs up on you when you try to. I only got a reply when I complained on their Facebook page about it, and they never followed through after that. Going to start using Amazon for my online shopping and Meijer for my local. Tired of suoporting this horrible company.",0,1
Walmart,Avoid Walmart online,"The issue that I was trying to get resolved was simple and was my mistake (though I think one that was easy to make). I ordered a Mac version of software rather than a Windows version. I realized my mistake before downloading and asked to swap for the Windows version. The answer was an absolute no, that there were no returns on software. The more frustrating thing was that the responses barely made sense.

Walmart,"Refund from Walmart.com? Yeah, right!!!!","I ordered some capri work-out pants on Walmart.com at the end of Dec using a Vanilla Visa gift card I received for Christmas. I ordered them ship to store thinking this would be much more convenient and easy. WRONG!!!! One of them came to the store, the other sat with a blank shipping status for 4 weeks. I called customer service and they said they would refund my card, as thus item was obviously lost. I explained to the girl that it was a Visa gift card, and I no longer have it, as when the money was gone, I threw it away. She said it wasn't a problem, that AFTER my refund was processed I could go purchase a Walmart gift card for $1.00 and they could then apply my refund there. WRONG AGAIN!!! I called again today and was told by a supposed supervisor that since the money was already refunded to the Visa gift card that I no longer have, their responsibility in this process was over. She told me I would have to call Vanilla Visa and take it up with THEM. Mind you, I told her what I had originally stated, that I do NOT have the gift card in my possession, so how were they supposed to help me without a card number or anything except the last 4 digits? She gave me their number, and I called, and exactly what I KNEW would happen happened. I was told by Vanilla Visa that without the full card number there was NOTHING they could do!!! I'm extremely angry and frustrated that I am now out $10, and NO PRODUCT either!!! And everyone just wants to tell me there is NOTHING THEY CAN DO!!! Why couldn't I just have been sent a damn CHECK when I specifically stated I NO LONGER HAD THE VISA GIFT CARD THAT WAS USED????

Walmart,Still Waiting for a REFUND!!!,"Walmart Online customer service is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! I purchased an item online it arrived late, but I did receive my product, and thankfully before Christmas. I ended up returning the item in store on December 30th. It is now Feb 1st and I have NOT received a refund to my credit card. I have spoken to two service reps and both of which have promised me that I would be receiving an email in 24-48 hours stating that the refund will be processed and an approximate date of that refund. Today I called and spoke to a third rep that promised me the same thing. I refused to accept her answer and asked to speak to her manager. The manager explained that Walmart is experiencing technical difficulties with their billing department. Now I have no way of knowing if this is not one department blaming another, but I find it unacceptable that at the end of the day I still have not received my refund. So lets say that this IS a billing/technical issue. Why did Walmart not communicate this with me via phone or email? They claimed three times that I would be communicated with via email. Why not an apology or “ Thank you for your patience Mrs.--- we are experiencing technical issues and we are working towards a resolution to process your refund as soon as possible. You will be contacted in 24-48 hrs with a solution or update on this error.” Instead I receive silence, no email, no phone call no update on when my refund will be processed and why it has taken this long to be completed. It is quite strange that online I can click a button and in 2 secs I have made a purchase and funds have been withdrawn from my credit card, but that refund button at head office doesn’t exist. Or perhaps Walmart is hoping there are people unlike me who just trust that the funds were returned and never check their statements. Since I received no communication I can bet that if I never called to inquire I would NOT be receiving my refund. Next steps; you would think that a manager would offer some sort of compensation or proof that he is working on a definite solution and not just apologizing. Actions really do speak louder than words. Walmart wants their customers to have a good experience, right? WRONG! The manager proceeded to tell me that he could not ensure that there would be any compensation, such as a refund of my credit card interest for the past month, or a gift card or credit towards future purchases. The money is not the issue here I would like to be treated as though I am valued as a customer. I would like to know that Walmart would like a chance to win back my business and change my experience to a positive one. But I am sadly mistaken. Here is an example of SUPERB customer service; Walmart, are you listening??? I purchased an item on Amazon online. My product arrived at the shipping address one day later than I was promised. This was an inconvenience as the item needed to arrive on time. I shipped the item to a relative because it was free shipping to their address and since they were coming to visit the following week they would be able to bring the item to me. However, they took their flight Thursday morning and the item did not arrive until Friday. Two days later I received a phone call from an Amazon customer service rep. She first acknowledged and confirmed the date that I received my item. Then she apologized for the lack of consistency on their end as the item was delivered a day late. I explained my dependence on the accuracy of the shipping date. She proceeded to explain the cause of the delay, which I appreciated. Lastly she told me that the service I had been provided was below their standard as they expect their customers to receive their items as promised and stated when they purchase online. She told me, in order to compensate me for the inconvenience my purchase would be refunded in full and I could chose to either keep the item or return it to Amazon. I am still praising the outstanding customer service that I received through Amazon and needless to say that I was eventually able to enjoy the product I purchased as well. Does Walmart intend to compete with companies like Amazon? Based on my current experience I will never shop on Walmart Online again. But Amazon, I would any day.",0,1

To amazon's credit, in all the years that I have received merchandise from them, I have never received the wrong item ..

There's no report that tells in store Walmart associates that they should have 10 boxes on Monday, 8 boxes Tuesday, etc. Therefore it's just by chance that you actual receive your online order.

When the keys finally came, the lady said the laptop was out of stock eventhough it was displayed to the customers. I am extremely disappointed with the horrible customer service at Walmart. It isn’t right to display products that are out of stock! Any other store would’ve given me a discount on another product but she said it was againts their policy.

Walmart,Ordered a tail light assembly for a lexus,"Ordered a tail light for a lexus on December 27th. Still had not come by January 18th. First got their supplier; they gave me double talk. The parcel was promised Jan 15 but it was kicking around San Francisco, San Pablo and Sacramento from Jan 3rd through Jan 4th and reported transferred to the post office Jan 4th then the trail went dead. Contacted Walmart again today on their useful chat feature. First they blamed the contracted supplier. I said, ""but I bought it from Walmart!"" Then they promised to escalate my problem and i would get a call next day. On Saturday? Huh? I was then passed to a resolution specialist who offered a refund, but she would not contact the supplier to have a replacement expedited to me in Hawaii. So I accepted the refund (which she said I might receive in five days) and ordered a replacement from Amazon within 10 minutes which will arrive January 31st. I have some faith that Amazon will not try to give me double talk and a runaround. Walmart should have just gotten me replacement product. I can see i was a fool to order from Walmart. I won't make that mistake again. They didn't care about me, and they don't care about you. The can be counted on to do just the legal minimum and not one dollar more. Somewhere deep within the bowels of Walmart someone must know that when you burn out a customer, he/she is going to contaminate on average ten potential customers. This is a well known statistic. Get your customer the product they ordered, offer them a gift card, do something...but don't just hang up on them! My order number was 6321882-933723 dated Dec 27, 2018.

The unfortunate thing was it was after the holidays and they did not have any in stock to exchange. The girl then told me that there was nothing she could do for me. This is extremely unacceptable because I purchased this DVD defective from the store and only would’ve known it was defective by opening it. The least they could’ve done for me was let me return it for a gift card with the amount I had paid. I will never purchase another DVD from Walmart again due to the lack of customer concern and care.

Walmart,Walmart Gleenwood Raleigh NC,"1/5/2018Dear Walmart,Incident was one 1/1/18 at 15:56 as per the receiptWal-Mart Raleigh NC 6600 Glenwood Ave. 919-783-5552 I have shopped your stores for many years. I have worked many Christmas seasons as a second job at Walmart’s- usually in ladies’ apparel- as I raised 7 children. Walmart has made it affordable and enjoyable in my life to give my family things I could not afford as a mom of 7 during those years.I am now close to 60 I am wise and appreciative and the first to track down a manager to say how much an employee has went out of their way to help me. I have waited 15 minutes for a manager just to say that. It is rare I complain but this time I just have to. Humiliation and being degraded is something I feel no one should suffer regardless of who they. Fairness is something as a past caseworker I have always stood for. Yet humiliation is what I felt at the Raleigh Walmart a few days ago. Embarrassment and humiliated.I did my shopping and proceeded through the self-check out. I became nervous as the line waiting behind me was so long. I could hear someone complaining about people like me who had more than a couple of items and there was no attendant around to listen to them. SO, I hurried through without bagging everything Especially the sodas I don’t bag them anyway. You will see me in the video turning to look at the line behind me. When I was done, I walked towards to the females at the door checking people’s purchases. I Said “Hi could you help me….” The young girl took my receipt and the other woman made a Huff noise. I was trying to ask for help because I felt so rushed not everything was bagged. I then said I know the shampoo was not rung through I will do that… and again the woman made this noise it was an intentional noise. I made me stop talking, I asked her what is the problem? ZERO eye contact, ZERO acknowledge that I even spoke. The younger girl went through everything and then this woman grabbed my bags that were full and dumped them and she lifted up the folded pants and shook them out. People were staring and I asked her to stop and why is she doing it like that. AGAIN, no acknowledgment I even spoke or even eye contact. I said you re embarrassing me I didn’t steal anything I was in hurry- it’s just the shampoo. Again, she made that stupid Nosie. She just continued. It was humiliating me and she was being very obvious and people were looking like I was doing something wrong and please don’t say she was helping me- she was deliberately being cruel.Everything was fine in the cart but the shampoos which I knew- except the younger girl let me know I had rang up 7 diet Pepsis but had bought a mix of different kinds- I told her I thought because they were all the same price it did not matter and she started to explain to me about the inventory when this woman interrupted” go to the returns” I again sked why are you being like that? Again, not even an acknowledgment I spoke. The return line was very long and I said no I am not, I will do it correctly next time, she again made that noise and said “Go the returns”. I walked back to the line for self-check out and told them to get a manager who helped me check the correct sodas out and the shampoo I had TOLD them I had not rung up when I went over there asking for help. The manager appogized over and over about her behavior but to me that is not enough. It was obvious this manager KNEW this woman acted this way because she automatically understood and said so. NO ONE should be humiliated like this or ignored and not spoke to which she did. Not one look at me, not one word as I asked her questions. Even when I was done and walked out the door I aske her why did you act like that? And said it was rude- not one eye contact, not an apology not even an acknowledgment that I existed or spoke.I am sending this to CEO- shareholders I know and cooperate. I don’t care what excuse she may have but her treatment of customers is horrible and should stop. I don’t care about her thoughts in this matter because she is driving away good and decent customers. At 58 I would have a criminal charge somewhere in my background if I was a thief but I do not. To be treated like this when you’re asking for help in inexcusable- I don’t also care what her history or culture is because she chooses to work with the public.I work in that area and frequent this Walmart and I saw one time another customer upset with her, I was just walking by- so I KNOW it is not just me. From this point on I will have zero dealings with her I will refuse to let her near me or my grandchildren or look at anything I purchase I will ask for someone else and protect myself and who ever is with me. Her cold and unfeeling attitude is disturbing. NOTE * Just looked up store manager and this makes this even worse that it is Rabia Bharde the manager that acted this way. What a sad lesson for the young girl she was working with. What a bad experience for anyone who deals with her. NO, I will never shop here again and yes as a reviewer part time I will spread the word to family, friends, church and the internet. Walmart just lost some respect because I know I am not the first person to complain and still she is there. Then I also remembered that I had witnessed in the past this same person being cruel to employees- while shopping. Nasty mean comments on two occasions I just did not put two and two together. I remember thinking back then how degrading that was to the poor girls she was talking to. Just sad all of it.Mrs. Patricia Hockenbury",0,1

Walmart,Wouldn’t Use Again,"I’ve used walmart’s pickup service multiples times and was pleasantly surprised at first but things have started to go down hill. The first minor issue was with substitutions I didn’t want and an item I didn’t receive. That was taken care of easily and credited to my account. No big deal. Recently, the orders have been later and later. I usually select 7-8pm and I’m not getting notification that they’re ready till about 3 minutes before 8. I didn’t think much of it till the last order yesterday. I scheduled it for 6-7 so I had time to make a few things before a New Year’s Eve party. Never got an email saying it was ready. Checked the delivery status on the app and it said delayed. I emailed customer service and they couldn’t tell me why they had a delay or when it would be ready. They told me they needed more info but didn’t ask for anything. I asked what info they needed and they ignored that but continued to say they needed more info. I got an email at 7:30 am that my order was ready. I couldn’t even pick it up then and had no advance notice. I haven’t received an apology, a reason for the delay, a solution to make this better, nothing. I’m very disappointed as I won’t even have time to make my items for the party.",0,2

Walmart,Worst store pick up service,"I have been using the online order and pick up in store from many stores and they are good except Walmart. It was a worst experience that I never use it again.1) I ordered an Lego toy for birthday on Saturday. The order said it should be ready by 8PM on Friday so I thought it would good because I could pick up after 8PM on Friday or early Saturday morning. On Friday, I drove by that Walmart and decided to come in. I found 2 boxes of that Lego toy left but the price was more than online so I did not buy it. Around 7PM, I received email from Walmart saying the order would be delayed 'til Monday. I called the store pick up and they said they ran out of that Lego toy. This meant they never bothered to reserve the item when you submitted the online order. I decided to order Amazon because it was ready to pick up on Saturday morning at Amazon locker. As soon as I ordered from Amazon, another email came after 8PM on Friday saying the order was ready to pick up. I was upset so I decided to cancel the order.2) Few weeks later, I had two orders. One order with 3 toys and another order with one toy. I received the notification email saying the first order was ready to pick up. I came to the store around 9AM hoping to beat the terrible traffic but I still had to wait patiently in line for 10-15 minutes. There was 3 people behind me. One man came and asked where to pick up online and an associate pointed to the same line so he was the last one. When another associate came to help out, she pulled out the last person in line to help the pick up when she ignored me the first person in line. When I complained to the supervisor who stood nearby, the answer I got was ""She did not know"". What!! What did she mean ""She did not know"". That should be common sense and basic customer service to help first person in line. They definitely needs to provide the basic training to their employees.3) The second order I mentioned above came and I got the notification while I was at work so I decided to pick up after work. At 4:51PM, while I was still at work, I received an email saying my order was picked. What!!!! I came to the store next day at 9AM, the supervisor said I already picked the order at 11AM yesterday (not sure why I received email at 4:51PM). I told her that I was at work. She told me that she needed to check the camera to find out who picked my order and asked me to come back at 1PM. I came back at 1PM waiting in line for 5 minutes and she said she did not have the time to review the camera. She told me to come back at 8:30AM the next day so I did. When I saw her, she said the video person would not come until 8:45AM so I told her to call me because I spent so much time on this and had to go to work. At 1PM, she called and told me that she found my order. Phew!!I almost got package thief at Walmart pick up.",0,1

Walmart,WalMart Web won't fix a charging mistake on a web order if you pickup in store,"Used the walmart.com web site to pick-up a car battery and they hid a ""core fee' (a California fee to ensure you return the old batter when the fee is refunded) in the Tax line of the purchase. When I was at the store I had the old battery and asked about if there was a core fee, they said no and so I just left the old battery Only next day did I look at the tax a realize it was way too high. I chatted with the web customer service and the admitted the error in the way the data was displayed, agreed I should have been refunded, but then point blank refused to refund the money, saying I had to go to the store to get the refund. Unlike competitors (like Amazon) there was zero interest is just solving the issue (it's $14, they know the screwed up). We are taking about $14 here that Amazon would have refunded in an instant. WalMart is too focused on ""which bit of WalMart screwed up"" and not enough on ""let's make the customer happy"". Not a patch on Amazon and if the prime fee is what it takes to get the best customer service, it's worth every penny. Really really poor experience. I have to contrast it to Amazon, where their approach feel much more like they give their staff the authority to 'make it right' - I am sure there are limits. I've never walked away from Amazon web chat feeling anything less than 'that was great, solved in 5 minutes"". WalMart want me to drive 20 miles to the store just to give me what they agree I am due.

Walmart,Very unhappy customer of Walmart.com,I placed 4 separate orders for Trailchaser bumpers for my Jeep. When the first one did not arrive I was told it was stuck in processing. Then was told to cancel the order and order another that was available. So I did that 4 times. Every time they had multiples available when I placed my order. To this day I have not received anything. The customer service although they have tried to help me have not been helpful. I feel like I get different answers from everyone I talk to.

Walmart,gift card and store pick up problem,"I purchased a gift card from a while back, and never spended it. It contained like $20. And when I went to the Walmart store the machine wouldn’t allow me to use it. I asked for help, and they used a key. Still didn’t work, so they told me to come back next time to fix the problem. Ok, I came back, and they did the same method by using the key. Still didn’t work, and they told me to contact the gift card people on phone because they say that my gift card is too old. That’s stupid since online says “gift cards never expire”. And also when I contacted them on phone, they were taking too much personal information like how old I am and what’s my name and email etc. Of course I’m not stupid enough to actually give my information! Just wasted $20 guys, bravo, what a great life experience. Also this one time when I ordered on online order for store pickup on December 5th, the website said it would be ready for pickup on the 13th. I looked online and it says it has been shipped on December 12th. On December 14th I went there and it wasn’t ready. I checked online and called walmart, they say I have to have a Walmart account?? So dumb. And now, which is December 18th, it is now ready for pickup. I got so annoyed that I went to buy another product in store and went to cancel my order.

Walmart,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!! Buy on Amazon.com,"I bought some items on Nov 20th for Black Friday, and it stated that they have the items at the stores, when I pick the one close to home and did the checkout they give only the option to a store that was 10 miles away from home. When I arrived to pick up the items they said they where out of stock, that they will ship the items to that store that I have to wait until I received an e-mail to pick-up. The last item arrived on Dec 6th (more than 15 days after) but due to the distance to the store I was not able to pick-up the items right away, so ""their policy"" states that I only have 7 continuous days to pick-up otherwise they will start a return, and they did. Know I have to wait 5 business days for the return. They only answer they have is that's ""our policy"". So for them to ship the items took +15 days and for the return they have 5 Business days, but the customer has only 7 days to pick the item, they don't care if you are busy of live far from the store they choose to send you the items. I have talked to two managers (well supervisors since they don't have managers) and the only answer I have had is ""That's Our Policy whether your like it or not"". My advice Go Buy on Amazon!!!!!

You have no idea where they are being made and you have to go through the trouble of retuning items if the company offers returns. Well I'm sad to say that walmart.com is not a dependable website! The items I received were not Walmart quality at all! The items I received were NOT the items I ordered by any stretch of the imagination. They were just like the items I ordered from all the other websites! Chances are you're going to receive total crap! I want a website that is dependable. What you see is what you get.,0,1
Walmart,Very unhappy with my current purchase…,"Very unhappy with my current purchase and have been completely ripped off. Ordered a video game online at WALMART.COM which apparently sells from third party vendors (figured I ordered from Walmart.com it would come from Walmart) Attempted to return the order in store and was told that I would have to pay 20% re stocking , purchase a shipping envelope and pay $30 to return ship the item . So the unused, unopened product that cost me $47 will now cost me almost as much to return. This is a complete rip off and now I am stuck with a game I do not need or want. Will not be returning to Walmart again and I strongly advise others to watch out for this!",0,1

Walmart,Tire & Lube Center Ruined my husbands engine and claims won’t do the right thing!,"I had another shop inspect my husbands truck according to the requests of the Walmart claims department. We had to have the truck towed because the engine is completely destroyed by having too much oil in it. Currently my husbands truck is still sitting at this shop as we have no way of paying for the tow or inspection. The claims department said if they were liable they were going to cover these expenses. As the previous shop said, the truck had entirely too much oil in it from the oil change Walmart did. The claims department contact, Melba, called me a week after the inspection was sent and she rudely told me that there was no way my husband drove his truck for so many miles with so much oil in it without the engine blowing sooner. She cut me off abruptly every time I tried to speak and proceeded to tell me that she was denying our claim and Walmart would not be replacing the damages. She also said she would be happy to send my attorney a denial as well. I told her to have a good day, In Jesus Name. What they are doing to us is not right. Not one but two different shops have looked at my husbands truck and have confirmed that they put too much oil in it and it caused engine failure. Share this until cooperate sees it!! Walmart needs to fix my husbands truck!! My husband just got this vehicle in September 2016. It was his 1st vehicle ever. Nobody deserves for this to happen to them and Walmart needs to stand up for their actions and fix their mistake.",0,1

The girl was completely oblivious to the fact that you can returned items that you ordered from their website at the store. When she ask me to scan the QR code on their pin pad with my smartphone (of course) it didn't work. I was waiting on the line for at least twenty minutes before she got the return to go through.

What a way to support her company's mission to be competitive in online shopping. So, she reordered my items and said she cannot guarantee shipment. What a lack of management oversight! Definitely not a reliable place to do online shopping, they will charge you for items that aren't actually sent (but will create a shipping label), and still not guarantee shipment for your order.

A month later on 13th March, I was surprised to find a $11.51 in my mastercard statement titled as ''Bal Insurance'' When I called Walmart to ask why I have been charged this amount, they said that I have been enrolled in the plan. I begged them to cancel the plan because I have never consented to it and the person on phone agreed and said that I have been taken out of the plan. I was resting assured after this that I will get the refund that I was charged. I failed to check my mastercard statements in detail for the next few months and today I found that I have been getting charged for the same balance protection plan every month on 13th. I called the customer care to complain but they said they cannot do anything and its between me and the bank. I asked to speak to a supervisor and he said the same. They failed to tell me how a 3rd party is deducting money from my account without my information and consent regarding a product that walmart wanted to sell me. They gave me the phone number for Canada life insurance and shrugged their shoulders. When I called Canada Life Insurance they told me that according to their reports, I (the customer) has called in and requested the plan from walmart. I was shocked to hear this because I did call the walmart banking but it was to cancel the plan and not ask for it. They said they can only refund me the amount charged for the last 3 months out of courtsey and will not refund the 6 months.

Walmart,We the customer assistants in express…,"We the customer assistants in express stores are worked like dogs, we would love to be happy and smiling all of the time when we are working but the stores are understaffed, when you need the loo or you need a drink of water and you're the only person on the shop floor if the management are locked in the office you have to wait until they are finished otherwise they get annoyed at you.Tesco Express are creating more ways for the staff to get into trouble with informal discussions, if we spend too long at the till making sure there are no customers waiting to be served and not wandering around to complete delivery we get told off and vice versa.If customers are the heart of the company how can someone be disciplined for making sure no customers wait?From the majority of customer assistants I apologize for the times we may come off as rude or distracted, we don't realize how bad it is because all we can think about is finishing work and going home to people who actually care about us, rather than having to work down several aisles on our own, cleaning up glass breakages while customers are waiting to be served, making sure the customers are safe by checking for safety hazards, cleaning around the self service and tills so no one can slip, having to argue with dangerously drunk people because it is against the law to serve alcohol to someone who is intoxicated, being called names by some customers and quite often male customers giving the female staff unwanted attention.This is just a small review of something much bigger, please don't blame the majority customer assistants, we are trying to feed our families and yes some assistants are genuinely not very nice people but for the most of us we are thankful you still shop with us as without you we wouldn't have a job to provide to our families.",0,1

Walmart,Online Order Keeps Getting Cancelled,"On Friday, November 9th, I placed an online order for an electric toothbrush. For two days, the order status displayed ""processing"" followed by a complete order cancellation on Sunday around 10:30pm. Right when the order was canceled, I contacted Walmart customer service to get some answers. The representative told me that the order was canceled because it was placed on a device different from what was registered to the Walmart account... I was told to wait 30 minutes before placing the order again, but this time on the same device the account was created on. I waited one whole hour and placed the order again Sunday night around 11:50pm. Come Monday night around 10:00pm, the order was still listed as ""processing"" so I decided to call customer service again to check on my order. The representative told me the order is good to go for shipping soon and everything was working fine. Not to blow your mind or anything, but today, Tuesday, November 13th at around 1:00 pm, my order was canceled... I called Walmart customer service AGAIN to figure out what the hell was going on. I told the rep my order was canceled twice now and he told me the same, exact story I was told the last time my order was canceled. ""Wait 30 minutes before placing your order again."" I told the rep I was told the same thing the other day and he needed to do more research into the order. After being place on hold for a good length of time, he told me he would escalate the situation to the ""manager"" and to wait 24 HOURS to place the order again...I am so disappointed and frustrated. This whole experience makes me not even want to shop at Walmart online or in store anymore.",0,1

Walmart,Now a FORMER walmart.com customer,"I've placed several orders over the years, some pretty large, and many orders as of late as I'm redecorating a large home we just bought. 2 items were never received. Spoke to 4 reps, 3 of which could barely speak English and were of no help. The 4th said items showed delivered. They never arrived. The 1st rep, reordered 2 TV mounts that I had already received so I'll return those. The 4th rep gave me an email for the vendor of the products I never received, and which I paid $40 for, as if the vendor will replace them or refund my money when Walmart is the one who ships the items. I've never had issues with Walmart until now, but after reps being so illiterate in English and unable to understand anything, even through chat when its clearly typed out for them, then basically being ripped off for $40,I will no longer shop at walmart.com. Unlike them, I'm honest so I'll return the unneeded items they reordered for me. Walmart has lost my business.

They later increase their scam by saying they are sending me 24hours gift card to my email. After 24 hours I called them, they changed the story to we're sending you the check to your address. I asked which address and they kept telling me same address they have always told me. Please, run from this people if you need something good for your children, they will ruin it complete.

Walmart,Disappointing day at Walmart,Disappointing day at Walmart. Took a load of returnable bottles and cans in for a refund. The machine kicked the first bottle (a common label) right back out at me. I had several bottles of this brand so I did not bother struggling with the machine and took all of my returnables back out to the car. Returned to the store looked for a refill size bottle of Pomegranate SoftSoap. They did not carry this type in the refill size. Went on to look for a fabric shower liner sheet. The store display appeared to have only one type. The fabric of which had a satisfactory feel to the texture. I purchased it only to find when I got it home and unfolded that it did not have metal grommets at the hook holes only stitched button holes which will not last very long. With how the sheet was package one could not tell this. Considering time and gas to travel to Walmart it is not worth the effort to take it back. Took my returnable bottles and cans to another store whose machines took all of them without a hitch.,0,2

Walmart,Honest Company,"It surprises me people are giving Wal-Mart a bad rating since in my opinion they are the only honest company left. The reason I say that is--if you buy something and need to take it back, they are the best about getting your money back to you. Every other company wants to wait three to thirty days to give you your own money back when you overspend or return. This is a ponzi scheme and it is sad that so many American companies are allowed to draw interest off the money of their customers while they give excessive payback times. I have been dealing with WalMart for over twenty years and they are the only place I buy my clothes and electronics from. They have the lowest prices on most things and the fact that their clothes fit me no matter how big or slim I get is an A+.",0,5

Walmart,What's really irked me about Walmart…,"What's really irked me about Walmart lately is that it seems they feel they have such a large share of the marketplace that they can start neglecting what got them to where they are today.They have the service where you can place your order and go pick it up and now that that's taking off favorite on their website. Upon redoing their website they have done a couple of things that are causing customers to spend MUCH MORE $$$$. They are as follows:1. THEY DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO YOU. I do not understand why, is there is absolutely no reason for it. They have it in their system because if you walk in the store and go to a register it's there once you swipe it. Try it out, whether it's vitamins, Kleenex, or coffee the list goes on and on. When I complained before they said that it was because it was out of stock. I can personally tell you that I'm more than a half a dozen shopping trips I have walked right in after picking up my order and gotten those fish oil pills, deodorant, etc..... this also happened when I wanted hangers. I couldn't get them on their site for shipment or for pickup they hardly had any hangers available and when you go in there all the cheap hangers are there, but they only have the expensive ones on both web sites.2. FILTERING - THET HAVE TAKEN OUT THE OPTION TO SORT BY PRICE and their process of filtering out products is just idiotic. For example if I'm buying dog treats, first of all do I really care what department it's coming out of, but why not have the option to filter by dog size, type of dog treat. They make so much money and they can't put two people at work on the computer to come up with a filtering system for every item that they carry. They only have to do it once and it's done and it can be sent to every store. They stated to me when I complained about the sorting by price that they were simply redoing the system and it would be back. That was a lie.3. SAVINGS CATCHER - this is just become a joke because they have made it so hard for people to use this feature. First of all you need to have a smartphone you can no longer use this on your laptop and second it is so hard to try to use this feature on your grocery items because you can't even bring this to that website it's on they're regular website. I can go on and on about this feature and how it's changed, but it's basically useless and you don't really ever get anything back. They pick and choose what items they will allow for that given week because they say they only go to so many other stores but basically it's just a joke also.It's sad but they better watch their back because before they know it their competitors will have the same option available to pick up their grocery item orders. GREED, GREED, GREED and the want to be number one over Amazon. Because I am disabled and this feature is very helpful to me I'm waiting for the day that their competitors offer the same service and I can step away.",0,1

Walmart,Walmart Online Ordering System Needs To Take Lessons from Amazon,"I purchased an item for my wife called a Cricut Easy Press 2 on Oct. 9, 2018 and it was sold and shipped by Walmart. It was to arrive by Oct. 15th but it never was shipped and order online was still showing ""Preparing Order"". Talked to Customer Service and all they could do was cancel that order and re-order another one which was ordered on Oct. 16th with due date of Oct. 19 (tomorrow). Checked their website on the 18th and it still shows ""Preparing Order"" plus when they re-ordered their price had risen about $30.00 since I originally ordered and they never bothered to tell me until I discovered the new, higher price last night when I was checking the order status. I called their CS Rep again only to get told that since the price adjustment to correct the new price to the old was over $25 they had no way of correcting it but they could cancel my order (What glorious customer service). I told them that I could order from Amazon for $3 less but the product would cause me a delay on delivery till next week so I chose to speak with a Supervisor and she couldn't help either (same adjustment limit on her too) so I asked for her Manager and finally she made the price adjustment to match it back to my original order that I never received. Hopefully my second order will arrive tomorrow but if I relied on their ordering system I would never see my order tomorrow either since currently it still shows ""Preparing Order"". I'll update if and when I receive my order but in the future I will find it more reliable to deal with Amazon for better price on most products, more reliable ordering and better tracking information.....",0,1

I've asked for call backs. higher rep, at one point set up a conference call with me, and never called me for the call or even when I waited an hour, I then called in, got escalated. Was never transferred to ""Tammy"". Was lied to by the escalation Rep, asked to be transferred to manager, was told no, they'll call me back in 24-48 hours. It's a week later and not person has called or treated me with decency. Chat support, customer via email, has stopped replying to my emails and sends me a seperate email of a $25 dollar voucher that I need to speed $45. and mind you this was after I spoke to a higher rep asking them to make this right. When they offered a higher deal, then just blew me off. I need justice on this.All I keep hearing is someone else pointing the finger, and a small, we can make it right on another dining set, however I'll have to pay way more out of pocket to get the quality that I ordered and was taken away Unjustly. 1) Offer Sale2) Acceptance of the offer by buyer. check3) Consideration in the form of payment.

Walmart,I am rating Walmart only two stars…,"I am rating Walmart only two stars because of Corporate Greed.There are a few things I know about them that some people do not know. For example: In the beginning of the corporation, Sam Walton was very good to his employees. He gave a straight ten percent discount to all of his employees. After he died, in come the corporate executives who have a go ahead to do just anything they want to make the stores even more profitable. These executives could not care less about the employees working there and keeping the company together. Almost immediately, only certain things bought by employees at Walmart have the discount. What doesn't have a discount anymore? Basic needs that everyone buys. Groceries, mainly. What is their excuse? Obesity? No, they are just covering up by saying this. The real reason is they want a bigger paycheck. If you have a Walmart receipt look at the right hand side. ""X"" means it qualifies for the discount. ""T"" means it has been 'terminated' from the ten percent discount. You'll find that only high ticket items, electronics, and other higher priced items are the only ones included in the employee discount.No more Christmas bonuses for Walmart employees.A point system. It doesn't matter if you have a legitimate excuse, you have a point system. It doesn't even matter if the reason is you have cancer. They couldn't care less about the employee that keeps the stores together.

Walmart,Return policy is the worst,"I bought a vacuum couple years ago and it stopped working after 3 months and I took it to the Walmart and they said it’s under the company’s warranty and just call them, So I called the company and they have very rude and disrespectful people there calling them was a no help at all, so I waited for my Walmart warranty to work so I can contact them but they were no help as well with the return. I talked to them for hours on the phone and they transferred my calls to at 4 different people and they said I’ve to donate it and then email the receipt for a return, but I didn’t have time to go donate so I got an email saying that my thing has expired and to renew it I’ve to call them and went through all the process of transferring and at the end they just told me that it is expired and there no way to return it. So basically both my warranty’s were not useful at all and I would not recommend anyone to buy a vacuum or anything else that might stop working in the future.",0,1

Nowhere do the site explain that it could be hours before the item is ready. I have called several times to customer service. They have sent my purchase to financial security for fraud reviews. The finance security department is third party so of course I can't contact them to verify whatever they may need me to verify. I'm working from home and needed a laptop immediately, they have caused me to wait 2 hours already and can't determine how much longer the wait. Needless to say, I'm missing money due to walmart.com not explaining in detail the cons of using the online site.

I have received no reply. Apparently this business couldn't give a Hoot about its customers.My position is that Walmart presented us via Walmart.com with this bogus seller. Therefore Walmart has a degree of responsibility in the manner. I have not asked Walmart to refund the money as it is in dispute with Credit Card Company at this point. Walmart's position is they have no responsibility since the order was placed with a seller. That is close to same as saying they have no responsibility if they sold goods from their store that were dangerous or illegal because Walmart didn't manufacture the item.I hereby strongly recommend not to shop on Walmart.com or at least do no place orders with others than Walmart via the Walmart.com site.",0,1

I have had this pool less then sixty days. I was told the pool was out of stock for replacement and the only thing that I can get back is a refund. I have returned the pool just to find out my care plan was not reimbursed. I have been on the phone with Walmart customer care service for over a hour just to be told I have to email them a cancellation request. The hassle of getting my money back in full sucks. They claim to see certain CSR’s that entered my account but did not document. I should not have to go through a hassle when my purchase is less then ninety days.

Walmart,Auto service - Simi Valley Walmart,"Auto service at their Simi Valley store is a mess. They've got no idea how long a job will take and no idea how to do it right. Went in to get a battery changed....and added an oil change to service order.1) I knew that I needed a battery. (AAA had tested it when they came out to start the car), nonetheless, the girl on the counter insisted she would not sell me one until her mechanic tested it. Apparently my service time was extended because the shop didn't know which battery to install....so they just waited for the sales staff.. I had to intervene and tell the sales help to send the battery I wanted out to the service floor.2) Pushed to up-sell an air filter...told her no that I had changed it only a few months ago. Seemed unwilling to take no for an answer.3) When I received my car back (1.5 hours, not the 45 I was promised), it was hard to start and idled rough regularly missing cylinders. On opening the hood, *both* battery cables were loose, and only finger tight. Had to hunt down the mechanic to remedy this...all the while insisting that it wasn't *his* fault. (seriously? He's the one who changed the battery)4) Got about 1 mile away from the store when the check engine and other trouble lights came on. Was already late for an appointment, so I did not return to Walmart. The next morning I took the car to a local auto parts store.to borrow an OBD II reader to read the trouble codes. Came up with ""engine too lean"" & ""mass flow air problem."" Eventually sorted this out with another trip under the hood. Despite telling the auto center staff I did not want or need an air filter, they'd obviously checked it anyway.......because one of the filter box latches was left undone, and the hose from the crankcase to the air system was hanging disconnected (one needs to disconnect this to get the filter box lid off.) It certainly was not that way when it arrived at Walmart. And led to the trouble lights (and poor performance).5) Apparently Walmart''s mechanics can't be bothered to reset the ""service needed"" light when they do an oil change. Lazy and/or sloppy.Do yourself a favor.... The pennies you save by taking it here will be repaid in all sorts of wasted time, and having to get others to do the jobs right.",0,1

Walmart,I used to work at Walmart,"I used to work at Walmart. I was a hard worker and I didn’t ask for much. In the end, I got fired over what other people do all the time. I just so happen to be the person who got caught. Everyone turned on me. It was just like being in school again. I thought I left that life behind me when I graduated from school. I was watching a video on YouTube. BBC Man With The Biggest Scrotum. Afterwards, I asked someone at the table I was sitting at about what I was watching. I ended up being reported to Walmart Ethics over this. I wonder what would happen if that man were to walk in Walmart right now. And people talk about how people are killing themselves and how the bullying needs to stop. I bet that man would be held accountable for something he cannot help. People started to make up stuff and add onto stuff from what I had told them. People asked me questions about breastfeeding and pregnancy and I answered honestly. I told hilarious stories about me and my husband. I was told that I had gone into vivid detail of my sex live. It was even said that I told a customer something sexual. I found what looked to me like condoms on the banana table. I asked about it. In other words, watch what you say and don’t make friends. I’m not upset. I’m just letting people know that if someone really wants to get to know you, they would hang out with you outside of work instead of talking about breastfeeding and pregnancy amongst other things while at work. Nine times out of ten, someone who talks about breastfeeding and pregnancy amongst other “iffy” topics at work is someone looking for ammunition against you if at any point they want to get rid of you.",0,1

Those awful female employees we're so rude and so nasty and would not open a regular aisle and delighted in telling me no. I asked for a manager. These b**** females just laughed. They could not have been more rude. They were thrilled to give a white American a hard time. I will not shop at any Walmart ever again. Not that Walmart cares but they might miss $5,000 a year that I will spend elsewhere.

I then called Corporare who simply said they would forward my complaint to the manager which is not helpful at all given I just spoke with him. I will definitely not refer anyone to shop WalMart and advise them to shop some place where customers are treated well.",0,1

Walmart,Always letting me down..,"I just purchased 2 laptops for a very good price via walmart.com during our states tax free weekend, but as usual you email me 2 days later to cancel because ""you're out of stock."" Now a ""3rd party"" seller has it at a higher price. Yeah, that's a sneaky upsale if I ever saw one. This happens everytime with you. I purchase all of my children's Christmas gifts online every year from many different companies, make 95% of all my purchases online and yet Wal-Mart is the ONLY company I've ever had an issue with. Please tell me how is it that Wal-Mart is such a large company yet the system only updates stock every 24 hours?! You made us miss out on taking advantage of our tax free weekend and now all you can do is try to upsale me? I'm not even one to write things like this and I simply don't have the time but I'm just so disgusted with these sneaky tactics. I homeschool our 2 children and these computers were pivotal for their education. Thanks for once again letting me down!!",0,1

Walmart,New Customer Experience!! - UPDATE #2,"UPDATE#2 ........(PLUS 1 STAR) (See below for original review)Since my first update on their customer service, Walmart reached out in response to my review. Not only did they ask how my experience could've been improved but they refunded me 20% and gifted me $25 on my next purchase. It was totally unexpected and has modified my opinion on their customer service caring about their customers. Hopefully my next experience will warrant 4 or 5 stars.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWI'm a very new Walmart customer. I've never had enough confidence in the quality of products to purchase from the stores. However, online I found hard to find name brand items for less than anyone else offered and with free shipping. I couldn't pass that up.- Unfortunately, the large ticket item's delivery date kept changing without explanation. If not for the cost savings I would've canceled straight away.- Customer service, however, was very efficient. She was patient with me and my angry rant. Was able to find an acceptable reason for the delay that satisfied me.I'll definitely purchase again (name brands only), if the savings warrants and I don't need it right away.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: CUSTOMER SERVICE DOESN'T LISTEN. (MINUS 1 STAR)I had 3 customer chats about the same product, above was my 2nd, this is about my 3rd. I contacted them when I received a ""delivered"" email but no package. She claimed the system had gotten ahead of the driver, even though he described specifically where he'd left the package at the location. She refused to listen. Now I have to wait AGAIN for a replacement. I was offered NOTHING to compensate for the inconvenience.- I'm not sure now the savings is worth the frustrations and headaches. I totally get the low ratings now.",0,3

Walmart,2 day shipping is a joke.  Rude customer service.,"I placed an order with 2 day shipping last week. 9 days later, still no package. I request a call from customer service, and they were no help and rude to boot.Updates: It only went downhill from here. Damaged package (not walmarts fault) was handled poorly. Slow “expedited” shipping. Of the replacement, lots of hassle scheduling the return shipment.Ultimately I had to return the item, and they told me to return it to the store. Then the store would only offer a gift card because it was a replacement for the damaged item, so I had to call back and get a return label instead. Then they gave me the wrong type of label, so I had to call back twice more to get a proper label, then again for them to schedule the pick up because fed ex would not allow me to schedule the pick up on their account.Ultimately I’d rather pay twice as much elsewhere than to ever deal with walmart.com again.",0,1

Walmart,Higher Prices and OUTDATED FOOD,"When I cut the cord with Jeff Bezos and Amazon Prime, I chose to start using WalMart online for most of my necessities. Recently, WalMart has changed their pricing structure which is really upsetting. I used to order all my paper towels, tissue, canned goods etc.., but now they TWO PRICES, One for “In Store” pick up, and One for ONLINE/DELIVERY. MOST items for delivery are anywhere from $1.00-$10.00 HIGHER NOW. I am disabled, and online shopping has made life easier for me, but this strains my purse TOO Much. I have since stopped supporting Walmart Then there is the Issue of OUTDATED FOOD. COUNTLESS TIMES I was receiving OUTDATED FOOD; from Rice, to Chips, to canned goods, to snacks. I got sick of having to call and report the old food. Not to mention, I was speaking to someone in a 3rd world country who could probably care less. I’m just DONE with Walmart.",0,1

Merchants and Walmart customer service play dumb about this obvious problem encountered with many merchants and multiple web browsers. Apologies, all fake, fly around. And the problem is not solved. None of my product reviews were published eventhough they're within guidelines. One customer service rep actually gave me a full refund on one of the items after spending a lot of time on this.

Ok, I said return it. Ok they say, but it must be in a box to return it, I ask how do I do that? They say after escalating to their tier 2 sophisticated customer service, “that’s my problem, if I don’t b0x it, I cant return it”.. they cared nothing that they short shipped an order and charged me, they cared nothing that they could simply get me a key.. and they certainly cared nothing about customer service. If I couldtn’t Use something I got from them, they don’t care. It’s like about Walmart policies. .... well, I’ll cancel the credit card payment and see them in small claims court before I get stuck with a gun safe I cannot open. My advice, don’t purchase anything that requires opening from Walmart.com, because if you want to return it they make you pack it all up again for shipping.

Order placed on the 28th( 2nd time) and would be ready by May 6th or 7th. Today is May 7th. Husband called to find out about tires.

Walmart,I was in Wal Mart in Rohnert Park,"I was in Wal Mart in Rohnert Park, California tonight -- the multi-purpose store, not the grocery store. I wanted to buy a data stick to download a large number of photos. The data stick case is locked, so my business partner went looking for an employee. Ten minutes later a young man came wandering up to the cash register to help two men who were buying a video game. They then chatted for another ten minutes about video games. Tom then asked to buy a large-capacity data stick. A woman with a full cart of merchandise said she had been there first. The young man asked her what he could get for her, and she said she wanted him to ring up all her items. Confused, he said she could go to the front registers for that. She refused and insisted he ring up all her items, knowing we we're buying one item. We left and I asked the door monitor if there was a manager in the store. Of course there was not -- it appears there never is. So, tomorrow Target or Office Depot. I have said before I will be very ship there again, and now I am serious. Cheaper isn't everything if it means enduring incompetence and zombie-like demeanor. Of course, considering what the pay and the working conditions, you really do get what you pay for.",0,1

Walmart,Order elsewhere,"Order elsewhere. Seriously, even if its a better deal than Amazon its not worth the money you might save. I placed an order for an electronic I needed in a short time frame. It had still not been processed on its projected day of arrival. I called Walmart and they told me it had been mysteriously delayed in processing, and they were unable to track it. They told me that *I* should cancel the order and re-order it again, with zero apology or offer to expedite or discount the purchase they had failed to deliver in the time frame promised upon purchase --a basic fail to give me any reason I should give them my business again. Another company ultimately came through at an even better price, and they shipped it out the day I placed the order. Honestly, I have so little faith in Walmart at this point that I have just left the order open to amusedly watch how they handle it, presuming it will never show up on my doorstep. I finally got an email acknowledging the delay 10 days after purchase, promising ""We'll ship them as soon as we can and, if possible, upgrade you to faster shipping at no additional cost."" I bet.",0,2

Hhow don't start here, I purchased a product on March 28 with a promise that the item will be delivered by April 3. I got the tracking for the large bulk item a television set. On April 3 I received a call from Seko solutions stating my order is on the way. I took a day off work to receive my order. Around 2pm I get another call from Seko saying it was a mistake & it's still in dock & we'd have to reschedule delivery for wed April 4th I thought nothing of this. Rescheduled and took another day off to receive my order. Same exact thing happens, I get a call from Seko saying that the item will be delivered today. I wait & wait. No calls, by the end of the day I figure the may reschedule. I check the tracking the following morning & it says it was delivered & sign by God know who. From this point it goes down hill. I'm calling Walmart, they push me off to seko, and vice versa. I then get a manager on the phone who flat out accuses me of theft & getting someone else to sign for me. I would never spend 3k$ to get a hassle like this in return its simple crazy. She then tells me to file a charge back with my bank. At this point I'm all out angry because it seems Walmart customer service is basically set up to rob it's customers when placing large amount orders. I get off the phone with her and get in contact with a supervisor. He then tells me to file a police report I'm only wanting what I paid for at this point so I do as asked and filed a police report with my local PD. When I call back the next manager says in the notes I'm told to basically go away & there's nothing that can be done. At this point I have no Choice but to beg & plead for a resolution. As it seems Walmart is basically running away with my hard earned money. If this helps anyone else out who plans on making a Walmart.com large order do yourself a favor and go the other way.

Walmart,Buyers Beware of sellers on Walmart.com,"I was looking for a cheap winter jacket just for working in the yard in the cold mornings, and to run to the grocery store real quick. So I looked on Walmart.com and found a jacket that looks like a puffer jacket for a really good price. But this was not sold directly by Walmart, it's some other seller JC Sky Inc. I ordered it and had to pay for shipping. It came in about 7 days so I was pleased with that. Then I open the package and the first thing I notice is how bad it smelled, it was overwhelming. When I got over that I tried it on and it was way too small. I ordered it in my usual size but it may have been a junior size. It looked nothing like it did on the website. It looks really cheap and it was not a puffer packet. So I wanted to return it and looked at their return policy. This is not the Walmart return policy it's the seller, JC Sky Inc. return policy. The jacket has to be returned to them and Walmart has nothing to do with it. It said all tags must be on the product and original packing slip. Well guess what there were no tags at all on that jacket, not a price tag, nothing. I think it may have come from someone's closet who didn't want it and returned it. I was very upset about this but decided not to go through the trouble of returning it because I would have to pay shipping and I have the feeling it will be very hard to get a refund from these people. So beware when you order from Walmart.com Stay away from these other sellers, I will make sure I don't ever order anything from this crappy seller, JC Sky Inc. ever again. I donated the jacket and some 10 or 12 year old girl may fit into it. Thanks Walmart.",0,2

Walmart,I used to enjoy shopping online at…,"I used to enjoy shopping online at Walmart. As a matter of fact I was a regular online shopper, sometimes 2 or 3 orders each and every month of at least $35 so I could get free shipping. Though all of that is past history. I am very displeased with Walmart. I just recently discovered that Walmart has 2 different prices for each item. Here's an example; Taco Bell Sauces in store purchase is $1.34 and online it's $1.48. So here's my situation...I'm a disabled veteran and I don't drive and my disability pension from the VA isn't very much at all...I'm actually living below poverty level. So I need to be very frugal and get the best prices. I think Walmart is playing some dirty rotten tricks on their customers. They heavily promote online shopping....now I understand why. This 2 prices for each item (scam is what I call it) is on at least 50% of all their food items. By spending $35 to get free shipping is HOGWASH. You're not getting free shipping because you're paying for it with the higher prices for online shopping. Walmart is LYING AND STEALING FROM THE PUBLIC. Isn't there some kind of law that protects the consumer from these sales tactics? I used to be a loyal customer but not anymore. Walmart you can kiss my ***!!!",0,1

Walmart,Online buyers beware.,"I first want to say I use to have confidence when I would order online. Until I was looking for a cell phone to replace the one I had that was broke. I tried to find the one just like my old one only of course they did not have that phone anymore. So in trying to find the right cell phone close to the one I originally had I would order a phone with little to no info and beings you can't tell by looking at pics. I ordered a phone only after I would receive it to find out it was nothing like it seem. Then finally I ordered an upgrade from what I had and thought it was going to be a great thing and my search was over. Until Walmart sends the phone through UPS in a bubble envelope only to find it was damaged, they offered to send a replacement which I thought was really nice of them so after returning the damaged one ,they send the replacement in a timely manner. After few days I started having issues with it not working properly, and then was told they would not refund or credit or even replace the phone. After complaining to their customer service, I received an email from that department saying they were refunding my money. That's not the worst part Walmart.com has now flagged me in never using the online service again due to returning too many products. Well if they actually sold and shipped descent and working, products I would not have had to make any returns. They never disclose any info stating their so called return policy. So buyers beware. I know this review won't change anything regarding my situation but may help someone else be wise in trusting what you order online.",0,1

Walmart,Scam artists,"Scam artists. Found a sink for $430. The product was being sold by Walmart.com via Wayfair. Ordered on Dec 9, 2017, Promised ship date was Dec 19. The sink did not arrive. I inquired to Walmart who contacted Wayfair on my behalf. The reason given to me is that the Walmart site had incorrect information and they apologized for the error. The new estimated ship date was Dec 28. I canceled my contractor and re-scheduled. On Dec 22, I received an email from both Walmart and Wayfair that due to being unable to make the shipment date, they are refunding my purchase price. I went on the Walmart and Wayfair sites and the new price is $504. 2 are in stock at Wayfair. They just didn't want to honor my price that I thought was a binding contract and used some excuse that that couldn't deliver to get out of the obligation of selling it to me at that price. Not my problem. Internet shopping is supposed to offer some sort of confidence. If I am in a real store. If the price tag on the item comes up different on the register, they have to honor what it was tagged with. I have now found the $504 price also on Amazon. They GUARANTEE it will be there on Dec 28th. NEVER AGAIN with Walmart. They should have made things right at the original price!",0,1

Walmart,We ordered a crib through the web site,"We ordered a crib through the web site, once we could see that the color was not what we ordered ...through the holes in the box it was in.... we took it back to the closest store to us as per the instructions they gave on the phone. Once we arrived and spoke to the woman at the customer service desk, she informed us that the purchase was a ""third party"" purchase, that Walmart does not honor those returns and we would have to try to return it directly to the manufacturer. Long story short, the manufacturer would not refund our money to us for the reasons that can best be summed up as .. whatever they can make up in order to keep it. We then went through Visa to cancel the purchase however after the 30 day period Visa notified us that they would not allow for the cancellation because Walmart told them we did not follow their return procedures.... which was a lie! Let this be a warning to anyone ordering on line to check the return policy of Walmart or any company selling items through third parties. A very bad Review of the third party manufacturer will be coming.",0,1

Walmart,WALMART  On line ordering is a scam.  NO SAVINGS.,"WALMARTS on line ordering is a scam, they always try to manipulate you to come into the store to pick up or buy things a bit cheaper in the store. Basically, all I order are soaps and cleaning products , things that are always in stock, yet very difficult to get online at the best price.Online orders are never shipped on time or complete .. They seem to always say that 1 simple thing in your order is only available in the store to get you in the store to buy more . My last order was their ""1 box"" shipping price but they shipped from 3 different locations and i still havent received the 3Rd box. It's not worth my time to try and save money order g from them online , when I would come out cheaper in the store as long as i dont buy extra stuff .GET IT, that's what they want you to do!!!Update. . It's now been 2 weeks since the order was placed for cleaning products . The 3rd box has never been received. When I go on the Walmart site to check tracking, FEDEX advises (on Walmarts site) that the package was undeliverable and damaged , and to contact the shipper (Walmart). You would think that Walmart would automatically fix this but NO....It's Walmart and I have to waste my time I've looked all over their site and spent an hr trying to find a way to notify them it was never received and cannot find any way to let them known and get a credit issued or replaced.Seeing as there prices are higher on line and they make it so difficult to deal with, there is simply no advantage to ordering on line that I can see. It's way to difficult, takes so much time and tough to determine if you are saving any money . IT HAS TO BE THEIR ON LINE MARKETING BUSINESS PLANI not here to promote another online ordering service, but if this is their attempt to compete with Amazon they failed miserably.",0,1

Walmart,Scan and go inconvenience and safet y concerns... Important to read families with young children,"Fire the scan and go person that came up with this cockamamie its inviting thieves to come in and take product right off your shelves, and is not safe to children plus it's very wasteful. You put bags in the bottom of the cart people push and self bag allowing dishonest people to bag 5 items and scan 4 over and over again plus to those empty bags still attached to the cart going outside to their cars to then sit in the buggy return where they get soaking wet in the rain, or they turn off brittle from bring out in the sun or birds poop on them. Not to mention the buggies now have the biggest parent/child inconvenience in the world and that is put something that their child can beat their head on and or no room to put a child in the seat at all now my kids use to lay down and nap in the sit because they was to young to sit up and to bring in a heavy/bulky carseat place in the bottom of the cart looses space I did however learn with my youngest daughter that the car seat will latch onto a buggy handle safely but I'm too short to see around it and by putting the cup holder and the scan and go you can't put a infant car seat now for those parents who know they can latch it up there and the child can't go at the bottom before or now that there's a bag holder attached in the bottom of the buggy now that its the only option for parents with toddlers or small kids to terrorize a store if allowed walk but they're putting their child at risk of getting scratched by the bag holder or they're digging through shopping carts to find one without attachment or the shopping elsewhere or using little baskets to shop to qiuckly get in and out before their kids pulls a shelf over on top of themselves. I've already learned i cant wear my hair down in your stores my hair got caught in the drink holder and yanked alot of hair out before i realized it was tangled up i cant image a poor child getting themselves intangled in the cup holder and yanked bold and I'm not going to do the order online and you guys pick it because you don't check for expiration, freshness of anything becuause you don't pay your employees enough to do that simple act of caring to look into detail of quality of produce I seen an employee picking her nose while shopping for online orders so take and get rid of this idea too, hire you some employees to run the cash registers and opwn more registers and each store should at least have the cigarette all open at all hours of the day and night so that people that don't like the scanning go self check crap have a loyal cash register employee to cash them out and go back to the good old fashioned days. So that the prices can stay low, because you are not inviting thieves and parents with small children can safely and conveniently return to your stores because they are not having a dig through the carts inside the store to find one that their child can be in or not beat their elbows or yanked themselves bold I'm scared to know what scanning goes gonna be like on black Friday unless you team up with the local law enforcement to stand at the door and check every item in every bag and cart that goes out like sams club and hide the hand helded scanner and close down the self check in an attempt to lower theft. You truly have no cash registers to shop back. So I won't be shopping at Walmart on black Fri like normal I plan to go to target and toys are us instead just because I strongly believe its going to be a measurable experience",0,1

I like that their prices are low and when I do order online, the in store pick-up is nice. But I think I smile more than their employees. Also, it's the only place someone complimented my Will Smith sweater, so points for that. Also, kudos for having so many random things sell in one store. My uncle was asking to buy some airsoft gun accessory and I didn't know that even existed in the store. I didn't get it though because the Walmart that was selling it was really far away and the road getting there was too cumbersome for me. I did go to the store itself recently, however, a closer one, not the one that's far away, and I was shooketh by what I saw. Plants! Cute plants actually! And boy, do I love plants, but what bothered me was that the plants were painted! Why would you paint something so pure and cute? Still, I was happy to see plants that actually looked cute.

Everything I need is in there.God Bless Wallmart!,0,5
Walmart,Unacceptable Return Process!,"I love Walmart for their prices and selection. I have no issues with shopping directly at their stores. I love the self checkouts that save me a ton of time. My issue is with their return process for online orders. My experience was absolutely horrible. I had placed several online orders for Cuddl Duds tops in different colors and sizes. When I was reviewing my orders online, I noticed that the items were listed without color or size differentiation. Instead of seeing Top - Red - XL and Top - Blue - L, I saw Top and Top. It was very annoying, indeed. But wait! There was even more nonsense when I received the items. First, there was no invoice or package slip in the package. Each item came in a plastic cover with labels containing a bunch of numbers that did not match with anything on my online order description minus an item description, color, and size. So if you take similar items our of these plastic bags, you will have an incredibly difficult time to match the items with the plastic bags, that would be required in case of returns. I had an awful time trying to accomplish this. Printing a return receipt turned out to be another difficult task. Amazingly, ability to print a return receipt was not provided on the order detail page (that would be too logical); instead this is hidden at the bottom of their home page under Customer Support, down another couple of screens. I had to get help through the online chat. It is funny to realize that if I, an IT professional with over 30 years of IT experience, could not figure this out on my own, imagine someone less apt navigating the applications. But wait. There is even more fun. When I went to the store with my printed receipt and the items in their plastic bags, the return clerk still had difficulty matching the items and finishing the refund. Apparently. there is no ability to match the transactions against the credit cards used to place them. I spent quite a bit of time waiting for my return to be completed. And yes - there was only one clerk available and the people in line behind me were getting impatient. How can we stop this madness in the 21st century?",0,1
Walmart,Walmart finds another way to cheat customers!,"I hate Walmart!! Especially Walmart.com. I ordered a swimsuit in May & returned it immediately via their return shipping label which they provided online. Fortunately, I made a copy of it because once you print it, it's no longer available for you to see on their website. Yesterday (7/28), I get an email from them that they never received my return & put the charge back on my credit card. So I pull my copy & check the tracking info & sure enough, they received it on 6/5!! Another scam by Walmart to cheat customers! Beware & always keep a copy of your tracking number.",0,1
Walmart,Photo Dept,"I went to WalMart to print a couple photos from my wedding, which was several years ago. I used the self printing station to transfer photos from my phone gallery and then went to the counter to pay, the man asks me if I took the photos myself (which I obv didn't since I was in them), I said no. He asked for my contract with the photographer, which I didn't have since A) it was several years ago and B) my husband took care of it. He explained I needed to prove the photos were mine to duplicate. I tried to call the photographer but they didn't answer. Then he gets some other associate to come ""help"" him. At that point I was on the phone with my husband asking if he had a copy in his email of the contract and she began talking over me even though I was on the phone trying to straighten this all out. She then flat out accused me of stealing the prints by taking a photo of a photo. I pointed out that the photographer logo would still be present if the photos weren't mine and she said I cropped them out. I asked wouldn't the logo be in the middle of the photo? She said some pictures had better quality than others and that meant I was stealing them. At this point I was shaking, I have not and would not steal from anyone. I tried showing both associates that I had the entire album on my phone, crystal clear with no logos and they said they did not want to see them, well I am sorry but you are asking me for proof over and over and that was as close as I could get to proof and then you don't want to see them?I understand protecting rights, but I feel like these 2 associates were completely out of bounds and mishandled the situation left and right and instead chose to create a scene and accuse a customer of theft, loudly, even while I was calling around to obtain proof we purchased the rights. Even the customer behind me was uncomfortable and left the line. A manager should have been called immediately if there was doubt, not 2 associates ganging up on a customer. Luckily, when I called my husband back, he remembered we have a USB drive with all our pictures that was given to us by the photographers and we went to a different store to print the photos that I wanted. When I posted about this interaction on Facebook, I am apparently not the only person displeased with the photo dept and one person even told me they shredded her photos in front of her even though it was a photo she took with her own camera. I will not be returning to the Walmart photo dept ever again, and it will be a long time before I step foot in this chain for any other purchases either.",0,1

If you make a return to Target, you never have to wait more than 10 minutes, and I usually only wait about 2 minutes.

I asked to not have my order cancelled and was told it would take a week to review and they would leave my order open while that happened.

I called Walmart and this time I told them I wanted the items replaced. They said someone had signed for my package, a package that wasn't authorized for a signature. The name was an odd one so odd that it seemed made up, It had 2 letter F's next to each other and 2 letter i's next to each other. They told me to ask my neighbors and contact FedEx.

Walmart,This has been the most frustrating …,"This has been the most frustrating experience making a purchase...ever.I ordered a book case on line for home delivery. It was not long after that I arrived home and found a delivery ticket as Canada Post had tried to deliver the package and I wasn't home. When I picked up the package and brought it home I realized that i only had Part 1 of 2 packages, the book case came in 2 pieces. I found a shipping label packaged in with the Part 1 package and checked the tracking number. Canada Post had received the electronic label but no package and would update the delivery status. This was on May 6. I have had to call Walmart customer service more than 5 times since then only to be told 1. ""file a police report of the missing package"" (the package isn't missing it hasn't even left Walmart yet) 2. "" we will look into it and someone will call you"" I got that comment 2 times before, on the 4th call, I said that I'm not waiting to be contacted"" 3. ""we will have the other package couriered to you and will let you know when it will be delivered"" well that never happened so I called back AGAIN 4. ""let's just arrange for you to return the item for a full refund"" It is now June 15th, I ordered the book case on April 30th and Walmart has had my money since then. Walmart emailed me a shipping label and I attached it to the package, lugged it to Canada Post for return on June 16th. I got a Canada Post tracking number and asked for a delivery signature. The tracking report indicated the package had been delivered and signed for at the Walmart warehouse on June 21. So here it is June 26 and still no credit to my credit card. I call Walmart AGAIN and am told that my case will be escalated...whatever that means. The next day I get 2 freaking emails from Walmart. One cancelling my return and the other initiating a return with a shipping label to attach to the package for Canada Post. Did I mention that on June 20 a Loomis driver showed up at my door to pick up the Walmart return. Seriously? Why did they send me a shipping label for Canada Post AND a Loomis pick up???Today I called AGAIN and I provided the tracking number from Canada Post AGAIN to confirm that the package AND my money are still with Walmart. "" We can offer you a 15% discount on your reorder of the book case"" Are you kidding me right now, I'm going to reorder anything from Walmart ever?Happy to say I received a returned item confirmation email and I will be avoiding Walmart. My message to Walmart....get your shipping department in order and then train your call center customer service reps to be able to read and interpret case histories. What is the point of a reference # if the it doesn't provide an update as to what has happened so far in that case....seriously annoyingly time wasting pain in the neck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,2

Walmart,Confused if Walmart want's to sell,"I'm not sure if it is just my store, or if it is Walmart in general, but I believe 40-55% of the items we go there regularly to try to purchase are normally not being stocked. I have seen empty shelf for my item ( Sometimes over stock on the top shelf), sometimes the next item over flexed in to fill it, (this means it will probably not be scanned to be refilled cause no one will notice it empty) sometimes the next item is flexed over and the correct tag removed so it will not be scanned to restock. this last case I tend to see it on the clearance racks weeks later.For some reason the people that stock the shelves are brought in during busy times and no room for shopping carts and stocking carts, but they don't man the registers.Can there be some manager presence on the floor during the stocking time to prevent gab fests blocking the isles. I do not normally see this at other Walmarts.Walmart website and App, never agree on if a store has an item, and the price is almost always wrong.",0,2

Walmart,"Bad experience, good customer service","On April 29, I bought a custom made blanket from here, and the process of making it was kind of annoying, which was okay because it's not their fault. So after I purchased it, I checked to see when it was going to arrive, because since it was a birthday present, I wanted to make sure it arrives before my friend's birthday, which was May 5. I saw that it said the most likely delivery date was going to be May 9th, so thinking that it might be faster if I send it to my local Walmart, (so they could print it there, and I pick it up), I did. And thats when I wait, waiting, waiting, waiting. It is now May 10, AFTER my friend's birthday and I keep trying to check the status of the blanket but it just says ""Processing"". I have not gotten any email update, or any email saying there was difficulty with my product (which is extremely understandable because mistakes always happen). So I'm pretty annoyed by now since I waited 11 days for my item but it was still stuck at ""processing"". So I decide to go on the Walmart live chat and just see what was going on. (I recommend going on a live chat, rather than a call because it is just more efficient and less likely to receive ""bad customer service""). And I chat with them, probably over 30 minutes) to see what was going on with my package, and they tell me that the package had an error so it never finished processing, and so they just cancelled it and gave me a refund just now. I was understanding and grateful for the customer service because they explained to me. But the thing is, if I HADN'T come forth with the error with my package, I would've still been waiting for an email or something about it. I just think that if the product has an error, the customer should be notified of it.",0,2

Walmart's excuse was they can't control the carrier so it's not their fault regardless of their promise. I explained that I'm an Amazon Prime customer, and when I'm promised 2-day delivery, I get it. If they don't have reliable service to meet their promised delivery they need to change their promise or work out something with their carrier.

I literally watched as the in store C.S. rep called on my behalf trying to get someone for me. The rep hung up on the in store rep! YES... This actually happened in front of me.For the mythical customer service of Walmart.com.... it is an endless stream of lies, condescention and talking over you but accusing you of doing it if you dispute anything they say. It's as if they are trained that way. It isn't just one person... it's almost everyone I encounter straight through the ""Escalation Team"" member that literally yelled over the top of me as I was explaining the actual issue and what I was seeking. It's as if they are trained to read a script and if the customer asks them to stop reading and answer the question/ address the actual issue it sets them off. I literally asked her to PLEASE stop saying the words ""I apologize"" and ""I'm sorry"" and instead show me how sorry she is by addressing the problem. I was respectful about it but enough of the words ""sorry"" in favor substanative and on point action which is actual customer service. A week of sorries and inaction is not what Sam Walton had his stores set up around. SHAME on you! ... Sam Walton would be rolling in his grave at the approach of Walmart.com.------------------------------------------------------------------***** PROS **********+ Since in store selection is getting leaner and leaner, ordering online is the only way to get a particular size, color, and sometimes some items at all anymore (ex. lipstick color, flavor, etc.).***** CONS **********-- They don't package things properly (loose items break or destroy other items in a shipment) and or they send damaged products from the start since I literally have had to return 100% of items in several shipments from broken or damaged other items in the same shipment.-- The invoice lists say 5 items but only 4 of them are actually in the box (This has happened several times with coffee and filter related items, some with health & beauty products, etc.)-- They use unethical resellers and distance themselves from any responsibility for the reseller's actions. HOWEVER, the contract with the credit card company is with Walmart.com so when you try to resove a dispute, you have to do it with Walmart rather than the reseller if it escalates to a formal credit card dispute. When you talk to the Walmart.com Customer Service, it's a circular issue as Walmart.com C.S. rep will tell you to contact the reseller but if they are non-responsive or inappropriate, Walmart.com does not step in and resolve it. [[ Hey Walmart.com... try standing behind the products and resellers... Amazon.com has it all over you guys!!!!!!!!!!!! Read their A-to-Z guarantee, you might learn something ]]CURRENT issue- Called on Monday about issues with reseller. Was told I would receive a call from a manager within 48 hours. Thursday came and went without any return call. Today (Saturday) I called back only to get told another 48 hours. I kept calling until I finally got connected to a Third Level ""Escalation Team"" Lead/ Manager (both terms were used) only to be literally YELLED at and TALKED OVER when I dared to say that the action of yet again escalating it was actually no action at all. See comment about review for a Product vs. Reseller as she conflates them as the same. -- There is no way to leave a reseller review... you can only give a product review - REGARLESS of the nonsensical answer you will get from Walmart.com C.S. who doesn't apparently understand the difference between a Product Review (term on their website by the way) from a Reseller/ Seller Review. -- Secondary Sellers or Resellers are not held to their published return policies. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH ---- Active Figure ---- on Walmart.com. They do not honor the ""No Hassle"" return policy they advertise. It was 4 emails just to get an address and they did nothing but harrass me for details of why I wanted to return the item. It wasn't until I threatened to dispute the entire charge that they finally gave me an address to mail the item and then it was at my expense. After that they then didn't fully refund the item. I had to formally dispute the charge to get my money back (in process). They didn't answer the phone when I called and then they didn't address it when I called out in email the ""Nothing but Hassle Return"" policy that was the opposite of their stated policy. The only thing I got was an email referring me to their Amazon return process when I purchased the item from Walmart.com. You cannot return a Walmart.com purchase through Amazon.com... Unethical seller... HORRIBLE SELLER!!!!!!! Walmart.com Customer Service was useless in getting this addressed. They just kept kicking me back to the reseller. DO NOT BUY from THIRD PARTIES ON WALMART.com... you will not have any Walmart.com customer service.***************** In my call this morning with the ""Escalation Team"" manager she literally said she doesn't shop online when I asked her if she new the difference between a Product and Reseller review since she kept conflating them. I used the reference of Amazon.com's structure and she literally said she had never been on Amazon. She kept insisting the Walmart.com item REVIEW buttom on a product was the seller review. I pointed out that I was literally reading from the screen that said Product Review after pushing the item's REVIEW button. That set her off... she litally started yelling at me that I was being rude and not letting her do her job. So let me get it straight... you don't know your products or your own website and it's me that isn't ""letting"" you do your job???? You are a third level escalation manager for an online retailer but have never shopped online???? REALLY???????????????? Now that's funny... And this constitutes customer service and an ""Escalated"" level of it. What a joke!I detailed the entire experience for the Discover card rep when I went ahead and disputed the charge after HOURS of trying to get resolution with Walmart.com. WALMART.com is not Walmart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,1
Walmart,Gotta love WallMart.,Gotta love WallMart.Cheap products and always open :)I shop there weekly and have done so for 10 years now.,0,4
Walmart,Paying more elsewhere at least means good customer service,"Walmart.com's customer service consists of canned responses and a large group of people who apparently are particularly well trained to not understand the written word. Their live chat feature is no better. The staff who answer questions there are superb at completely missing the point. I have stopped doing business with Walmart, Walmart.com, Sam's Club and Sams club online store because of their appalling customer service overall.",0,2
Walmart,great,well walmart one of the biggest retailers out there they have two stores next to my house they selling everything from diapers to high end electronics prices are always right. every time going to Walmart i searching for better prices online using my phone but Walmart is always cheaper. BUT they dont have the huge selection you can find online. if i need something right away always will check walmart first,0,5
Walmart,I have used Wal Mart exclusively since …,I have used Wal Mart exclusively since they started offering two-day free shipping. I am was an Amazon Prime customer but have since stopped using them because of their political views. Wal Mart's site is easy to navigate and pay for your order. I highly recommend WalMart on line ordering.,0,5
Walmart,Pay your workers a fair wage!,Not impressed with this store as the products may be cheap but are also nasty. The more I read about low employee wages and poor healthcare coverage for them the less I want to shop here.,0,2
Walmart,Experience,Very good ideas for us!,0,5
Walmart,FRUSTRATED (w/ update),"UPDATE: After a complaint to the BBB, someone finally called me and made the refund happen that day. They also sent a $50 gift card. Therefore I upped a few stars for the resolution of the matter, though I still am amazed at how difficult this was for them to do. It should never have gotten to this point. Email sent to Walmart today:***************************Order #3091789-130070, 2 itemsThis is the 7th contact I am making with your company about this, the last 6 were by phone. You should see those in your logs. On FEB 7 I ordered two items from the website. I made the purchase with a $52.25 gift card that I purchased myself, and a credit card for the balance. The items did not arrive by FEB 11 as stated on your site. I called FEB 14 and was told that the order was stuck in processing and YOUR rep advised me to cancel and reorder the items. For my trouble, you issued a $4.57 discount added back to my gift card. I was told to wait 3-5 business days for the cancellation. On FEB 24, I called again and was told the cancellation was stuck, so the rep canceled the order AGAIN. She said wait a couple more days. On FEB 27 I made a third call and the cancellation was still not processed. The rep assured me that THIS time it would happen in 3 business days because he lifted something in the system. ""It will definitely be done in 3 business days,"" he confidently claimed. On MARCH 3, I made a fourth call and was told that it was still stuck, this time she was ""escalating the matter to 'Fulfillment'"", and NOW it will really happen, in 2 business days. She held me on the phone while she escalated, and said I would receive an email detailing that this was done. I never received the email. Apparently this call is not even in your logs.On MARCH 10, I made the 5th call. This time a Supervisor (""Frankie"") emphatically said she was escalating it AGAIN, this time straight to Corporate. She told me in no uncertain terms this would take care of it once and for all, and to wait another 3 days. I did not believe her, but she gave me an incident #170310-014809. On MARCH 17, I made the SIXTH call. They of course had no idea why it wasn't done. The supervisor (""Courtney"") said this time she was escalating the matter the correct way, and the other five people had not done it through the correct path. Apparently there are many paths, and only one of them actually works. I am laughing. She told me to give it 48 hours to take effect. Ref #: 170317-027454. Now it is 5 days since that call, and of course nothing happened. I guess that path was not the correct one either, despite your person's adamant assurances. What kind of incompetent system are you running?So it is now SIX WEEKS since my original order, and FIVE WEEKS since you told me to cancel that order. I have no product, and no refund. I can't file a claim with a credit card, since most of the order was paid by the gift card that I purchased myself. You have strung me along through 6 phone calls.I am ANGRY. You did not send me a product, then failed to return the money after repeatedly telling me you would, so you are in essence holding hostage money that is NOT YOURS. I have been beyond patient, and now I am FURIOUS. Here is my advice: since you are not going to provide a normal cancellation through your infinite and equally ineffective channels, I am demanding that you place the remaining balance of my gift card ($47.68) back into that card. I know you can do this immediately, without waiting any more business days, because you put $4.57 on that card within minutes of my first call to you. I am so frustrated with this company that I will devote myself into every possible way to file a complaint, leave a review and let everyone I know how Walmart does business and that it has stolen funds. Please respond ASAP that this has been done.",0,3
Walmart,I Love Walmart,"I know a lot of people are just on the fence or downright dislike Walmart but I totally love them, especially the online ordering. I like that they are in competition with Amazon to the point that they started a program of 2 day shipping like Amazons ""Prime"". The completion keeps the prices down and Amazon actually has a feature on the site that allows me to check their prices against Walmart and truth be told there is at times a bit of a discrepancy so I am glad for that feature and will kind of be using it against Amazon . Also Walmart has the Roll back prices etc for you to take advantage of . WHICH I DO WAY TOO OFTEN!!! But its wonderful to shop both on line and in the store, I love their Mainstay line of items and will continue to shop there, I totally 100% Love to shop with them.",0,5
Walmart,Walmart.com,"Walmart.com is not like dealing with Walmart they have selling partnership and neither Walmart or their partners will stand behind your order..They play the blame game on each other while the costumer gets the shaft..False advertising, cancelled orders, headache, waiting, emails,and fighting for refunds for stuff you didn't order or not receiving your order is what you get at Walmart.com .Don't expect any help from Walmart or the selling partnerships it's a scam on massive level..DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY from Walmart.Com the free shipping sounds good until you get what you didn't order,or they cancel your order while holding your money for no apparent reason or explanation of why",0,1

Walmart,"Wal-Mart in Monroe Louisiana, we call the devil store.",The employees at the Super Wal-Mart store in Monroe Louisiana act like they hate white people. We were walking to the door on one end of Wal-Mart at 8:50pm. The man looked at us & locked the door right in our faces. I believe they lock one door at 9:00pm.We went to the other door & I saw him. I brought up what he did & he let me know he didn't care. The employees are absolutely rude. We call it the devil store. We shop at a neighborhood Wal-Mart at Mckeen Place & so far they are not rude. I like the store but somebody in Wal-Mart administration needs to come to Monroe superstore & teach your employees how to be professional!!!!!! I write this because I just saw a commercial on TV with Wal-Mart employees being trained so professional which is BULL. Not at this store. If the neighborhood Wal-Mart I go to gets like your super Wal-Mart in Monroe I will go across the street and shop at Brookshires.,0,5
Walmart,Didn't get order when they said & didn't get what I ordered!,"The last 2 orders I placed didn't arrive in the 2 days as promised.

Walmart,THE WORST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCES EVER!,"""I have nothing but problems when I shop at Walmart.com! I have only purchased a handful of things from them and the shopping experience is far from simple and easy. First of all, I have a long-standing Walmart.com account. I also have a Walmart credit card, yet no matter what major credit card I use or even a bank debit card, my purchases are always canceled by Walmart and no reason is ever given with the notification (it's never due to insufficient funds/credit). Then I have to search & search on the site before I can locate a phone number for customer service. Then I’m always told that the reason my order was canceled is because I never used that particular card on their site before. This is crazy! I can go to any website that I have never ordered from before and never had had any orders canceled by the company. And then the only thing the rep will tell me is that they will contact their billing department and tell them to I was supposed to be able to pickup the item yesterday. I checked yesterday and my order was somewhere in Atlanta. Today it is in Tennessee! So far this is the 4th day and my order is nowhere near where I live in Florida. This is not the first time my orders have arrived several days late after the due date. I should have left Walmart.com alone after my very first order when the mini refrigerator arrived at my home with a big dent in it. I had purchased a protection plan but they wanted me to lug the fridge all the way to Walmart, and then I would have to re-order it online because they did not keep that model in stores and if I wanted the online price I would have to re-order it online all over again. They always tell me how sorry they are, but never resolve issues caused by them! It’s just one hassle after another with Walmart.com. If you shop Walmart.com you are truly taking your chances.""",0,3

Walmart,MY CREDIT CARD HACKED TWICE,"My card was hacked several years ago when I shopped Walmart.com. I did not ordered from them since until recently. I used a different card, went back into my account online with Walmart.com and removed all my credit card info which they automatically save without your knowing. Well, I had fraud on the card I used at Walmart. These two instances are the only times I ever had fraud. I will never shop online at their site again.",0,1
Walmart,CREDIT CARD HACKED,"I placed two orders on Walmart.com a year apart. Both times my American Express card number was hacked and fraudulent purchases were made. I primarily shop online and, over 20 years, these were the only times when my card number was hacked.",0,1
Walmart,Awesome,Shipping takes forever but overall great company,0,5
Walmart,DO NOT SHOP WALMART ONLINE,"DO NOT order from Walmart online. After the first order arriving damaged and the replacement never arriving, the customer service was amongst the WORSE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED and now at their convenience I have to wait for my 1k refund and for them to pick up the damaged item. The irresponsible handling of this order actually ended up costing me money and time and the inconvenience that was completely disregarded by their customer service is absolutely disgusting. I will be sure to spread this experience as much as possible and I suggest others do the same as I am positive I am not the only person that has had dealt with and been treated like this.",0,1
Walmart,Wally World Online is less than helpful,Whoever Walmart has doing its search marketing and online ads should get a raise... unless they are concerned with how effect the ads are. Every time I Google something the shopping suggestions/ads for Walmart come up... and yet they never actually have what I was searching for. If I go to Walmart.com looking for something and they actually have it then its good as long as you 'Ship to Store'.,0,3
Walmart,walmart.com,"internet search engines direct you to walmart.com - - it would appear that you can buy everything at walmart! NOOOO!! Take heed. Many third-party seller's products go through this walmart portal. unfortunately, walmart does not ship, refund, guarantee, etc any of this merchadise; although, you would believe that walmart is conducting the sale. BEWARE!! Find the fine-print and read it. YOUR PRODUCT MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE FROM WALMART.COM!!!! Seems very deceptive. Caveat Emptor.",0,2
Walmart,Blue Christmas,"I placed an order for gifts for my nieces, nephews, sisters, and parents December 16, 2016. All of the gifts were supposed to be at my house by December 22. 19 items in all, two from another retailer, which had a date through 12/29 for shipping and I got that on Monday. I got 6 items by Christmas plus one I picked up at the store. 3 items were canceled December 23rd. One of the cancelled ones actually came later, but was a dud and had a huge whole in the pants leg. In addition to that, some time during the first week of the year, they canceled the other orders. I am extremely disappointed because I had nothing to give family for Christmas and now half of the childrens orders have been canceled. I got them all pajamas and board games and now a few have gifts and few don't. Extremely frustrated with how this was handled. Christmas joy was crushed. I felt horrible not giving them something and now I'll have siblings with different things because of it. If you can't fulfill the order by the day given, have the decency to notify the customer. Update stock before an order is placed. It took over two weeks to cancel the last 8 orders. I would have not ordered at all if the delivery date was past Christmas. I was given a date of December 22 to have everything at my door. I'm extremely disappointed with my order and how this was handled, especially at Christmas.",0,1
Walmart,Not bad,"Walmart's okay but shipping takes forever, customer service isn't great, and prices are too high, but quality is GREAT! I've Never had a problem with my purchase, other than shipping time :)",0,4
Walmart,A Deceptive Company,"My first large purchase to Walmart, and my last. I bought some Bose 35 Headphones from them, and ON THE AD on line, it clearly states ""30 day money back guarantee."" There are no exceptions listed of any kind. Then once the product was MAILED, it get a notice explaining me that this was a third party seller (which was listed on the original ad), but that this seller's return policy is 14 days PLUS a restocking fee. There is NO WAY to know that until you actually have your order shipped, and then it is too late. Wow, just wow. Why would you put ""30 day money back guarantee"" right under the product if it wasn't true. Serves me right for leaving the class of on line ordering- Amazon. I will never give another cent to walmart.com.",0,1
Walmart,Item never showed up,"I ordered on Dec 9th and the arrival date was to be Dec 22nd and it never showed. How can you lose a 48' goal in transition? After multiple calls and no gift for Christmas, I was offered for my card to be charged again, wait 3-5 days for a refund and replace my order. Let's not forget the $15 gift card that they would send to my email. (Insult to injury) The initial credit was 10%.So you are wanting to take away the 10% and give me less of a credit. Way to go Walmart! Very disappointed. Final resolution was reorder and 30%. Not happy with that but tired of the issue. Order #6152654-796900.Christy the ""manager"" didn't care. She lack empathy and customer service skills. She sounded so uninterested. I understand she may have gotten complaints all day but her lack of care was my reason for the level of escalating. LAST BUT NOT LEAST.. I was told by the final woman that my item arrived on the 22nd as stated. Funny NO ONE else saw it.",0,1
Walmart,Dont ever order from this site!!!,"I ordered a present for a person off the website. I was guaranteed a delivery date.

The dude on the phone also told me he would send a gift card to my email for the inconvenience, nothing at all called back and they said he was not in the right to do either thing. Thanks Walmart for ruining my week not being able to give someone who came 350 miles to visit a gift that was supposed to be here the day they left. but was gone 2 days later when the package finally came. You lost a loyal customer, Dont ever order from this site. IT WILL BE A MISTAKE",0,1

I end up in talkning with supervisor No response back. I wrote to CEO office email. Got very quick response but person who called me did not correspond with me via email. She told me to look at the history on my account. It shows that I returned the item. This is another lie because order was never shipped. Pending more response at this time.

Walmart,Horrible service,We bought a wedding set for my soon to be wife. The rings were to be sent out to be sized and back to the store within 2 weeks. After waiting the 2 weeks we began to call to see if they were in yet and kept being told that they were not. We finally decided to stop by the store and see what was going on. After being told that they were not there yet the associate began looking and found them. They were never sent out to be sized. Now here we are 4 days from our wedding and she can't wear her rings. They pretty much told us they don't know what else they can do other than refund our money and let us keep the rings. What help that is no clue so now I'm scrambling to find someone to size them,0,1

Walmart,No longer a trusted reputable company.,Since they have allowed fourth party sales this company has gone to the dogs. They want to say they are not responsible but they are. They let OJ Commerce rip off customer's who were using their site trusting they would be taken care of only to find out the opposite happened.

All he had to say was well in 5-7business days the hold will drop go purchase out the store. The whole purpose of me shopping online is to avoid rude workers at the store!!!

Walmart,Worst experience ever online,"September 17 my girlfriend and I ordered two bikes from Walmart. We are in Los Angeles (Santa Monica) for 4 month for studying. So the bike would be great, when we have to go to the beach. Unfortunately Walmart don't think it could be nice to ride the bike close to the beach.The bike we ordered will be delivered september 22, witch its okay. I call Walmart because i want to hear the time for delivery since the mail is telling me, that it could be between 9 am to 9 pm. It sucks but we still have some homework to do, so it wasn't a big problem. When we receive the bikes both are broken and non of them can spin the wheel.I write to Walmart that the bike is broken, no problem we will send some one to pick them up, and then send you the new once. I have been in contact with Walmart serval times now and i should receive the bikes today. I write to them and the guy im chatting with is telling me, that he don't know why it isn't sendt but i will have them on friday 14 October.. Not both just one of them and the other bike would they make a refund with out telling me that. The answer was, maybe its not on stock but i don't know.Almost 1 month for delivery 1 bike witch maybe would work when you ordered two?And when you ask for a refund it properly will take 5 work days befor you receive the money back, even they have received the broken bikes.When you order something, they take your money immediately but when its the other way you have to wait, until they are willing to give you them back.I would never recommend Walmart at all, or supporting their business at all.Buy your bike at a dealer in the city, the extra money is definitely well spent we will do that!",0,1
Walmart,Satisfied so far.,"I don't really love the idea that I'm supporting a huge company that basically runs small business out of town and out of business completely... However, they do have low prices, and DECENT customer service. I've returned things here and there over the past couple of years, and I've never had any issue. (I've always had my receipts though, and followed return policies they have in place.) They're alright.***(I have never / yet to order anything from their site online or the app to have shipped to my home address... NOR have I ordered online / had an item shipped to a store close to me. I HAVE however, ordered and item online ONCE and selected same day pick-up. I had no issues, and the item was ready for me when they stated it would be, when I arrived at the store.)***",0,4
Walmart,Disappointed In Shipping Practices,"First of all, I love Walmart and its willingness to provide a myriad of products at low, low prices. However...the first time I bought something from their online store was so ANNOYING! I ordered a 7.1 cu. ft. freezer, two vacuum cleaners and some hair products. When the freezer arrived, it was delivered upside down, and the bottom of the freezer looked as though someone had danced on it. Parts of the frame were dented, and there were hammer impressions in the metal casing on the bottom. Happily, it works beautifully...but it certainly didn't APPEAR to be a new freezer (as was advertised) based upon the damage to the bottom of the unit. On to the vacuum cleaners. Okay, I ordered a Bissell stick vacuum to take care of my laminate floors which are throughout the house. I also ordered about 5 bottles of different Herbal Essences products, and a Bissell bagless vacuum cleaner for downstairs. Now, I expected these items would all arrive together, in the same box. Boy was I wrong! In fact, the Bissell bagless arrived only in its merchandise box, which was beat the hell up from the rigors of shipping. But get this, the stick vac and the five bottles of hair product were tossed into a box large enough to fit one of those 32"" televisions with a picture tube, and it was infested with those air pouches. HUNDREDS OF THEM! Yes, it was an enormous box that could have easily accommodated the bagless Vacuum, the stick vac, the hair products AND half of the freezer! That was the most ridiculous packing job I've ever seen, and it took a while to get to my home because of its erroneous size.In closing, it would be super helpful if Walmart were willing to train their warehouse employees on packaging etiquette. If you're going to have the availability to purchase online from Walmart, at least have a consistent supply of boxes in various shapes and sizes to accommodate your orders. Maybe have some of your executives tour the Amazon warehouse and see how they do it, because they've got packaging down to a science. It's merely a suggestion from a long-time Walmart customer who is disenchanted with her walmart.com purchasing experience.",0,2

But, lately, I had problems with 2 of my orders (I have not received them). Contacted customer support but they were not able to tell me when and if my orders will be delivered. I did receive them one week later...but I was disappointed by the way they treat their customers.",0,3
Walmart,"Good prices, products okay, delivery fast","Great prices. Fast shipping. Quality of products okay, recommend DEFINITELY READ REVIEWS.DO NOT LIKE RETURN POLICY AT ALL, ESPECIALLY ELECTRONICS.WHEN ORDERING THEY SHOULD INDICATE IF ITEM WAS RETUNED, FIXED AND RESOLDSome of my items look like they have been used, repackaged and sold again. I definitely order online because the employees are NEVER HELPFUL. This is at EVERY Walmart in Any City or State.Probably except lower part of Kentucky. I used to go in with a good mood but leave in a bad mood. Now, with my disability I order online, if I orďer from here. But others tell me staff has not changed.By now, Walmart should have loyalty/rewards card.Now, I shop other places before here. If you sell it back your items up with a MUCH BETTER RETURN POLICY.I will pay more for BETTER and RETURNABLE, and QUALITY, and CUSTOMER SERVICE on phone or in person before I look here.When you use a Happy Face as a symbol for your company, be sure the Smile is on your employees and MOSTLY CUSTOMERS.",0,2

I understand goof up's happen and ordered a different configuration with the option to pickup at same store and the repeated same thing. Please don't purchase anything online and waste your time.

I have spoken to many customer service representatives and supervisors too they have all lied and miss lead us in thinking I would receive the refund my Visa card. Today I spoke to a customer service rep and a supervisor I was on hold for one hour and half only to be told that I would not be receiving a refund.

When I went in to pick it up they brought me a different bike! They told me this was what I ordered. I said no, the one I ordered was green and silver. What they brought me was red!Of all the stores nearby I could find, it said the green and silver was available, when I called, they said it was there, when I went, it was not, all they had was a red one. They told me that the model is the same but they have no choice of colors that they get! [I'm sorry, but WHAT?!!!] Go to a furniture store and order a brown sofa, and when they deliver a blue one, tell me how you feel then! I'm very angry, Won't be ordering from them online any time soon, I won't know what I'll get based on my order!",0,2
Walmart,Definitely not Amazon!,"Did not meet their shipping estimated date and did not notify me of the change. I only discovered it when I started looking to see why it had not arrived today, the day that was posted as the delivery date all week long. And customer service was a joke. An apology and an offer of $2.95 adjustment! I requested cancellation and refund but they said I have to wait for the order to arrive, refuse it, and they keep my money until the return gets back to them! So if the order doesn't arrive for another week I still don't get my money. I'm at their mercy. I purchase online a lot but I cannot ever remember feeling as unappreciated. And I don't remember another seller not trying to solve my problem. Walmart doesn't get it. A big part of the reason I ordered from them is the date the items were confirmed to arrive. My problem is not that I need a discount. My problem isn't solved with an apology. I need what I ordered. Nothing fixes this other than getting my items to me or refunding so I can purchase elsewhere.",0,1

Walmart,Good Customer Service and Easy Purchasing,Walmart has really upped their customer service lately. The call center is very friendly and knowledgeable. I like ordering online from them because it's a simple process and returns are easy enough if something arrives damaged. I knocked off one star because about 8 out of every 10 orders I make seems to have something damaged when it arrives. Items could be packed better so that they are not damaged in transit.,0,4
Walmart,Dont really like the online shopping,Seems like everytime i go online to try to order something it is out of stock. and half the things i can find cant be shipped to the store for pick up and i have to pay for the shipping.

Living in a coastal town with temperatures steadily climbing during this intermittent time, I receive an email that a decision had been reached. I contacted FedEx customer service and was told it was DENIED! I tried to contact Davis King, FedEx claims, who worked the case, per a customer service rep's advice via live chat, but when I tried to call was denied access to him so that I could explain I wasn't a con artist, the air conditioner was NEVER delivered! I contacted Wal-Mart.com in complete frustration asking for help. I paid and Wal-Mart shipped, we did our respective parts, FedEx didn't deliver. Do you know what happened next? Two days later I received a replacement air conditioner HASSLE FREE from Wal-Mart.com!!!! Did I mention that the reason for my buying the air conditioner is because I have an asthmatic in the house?

Walmart,Walmart warranty ripoff,"BUYER BEWARE! DON'T EVER WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A WALMART EXTENDED WARRANTY! I bought a 70"" Vizio TV on sale in November and spent an additional $96 for a warranty. 4 months into ownership, we were watching it one evening and the picture slowly faded out and turned to black over 30 seconds. Several calls and a service tech coming out to my house later, deemed the TV unrepairable?? Now the warranty company says its their option to replace the TV OR refund the purchase price. This model is still available for purchase, but they are refunding the sale price I paid. I can't repurchase the TV for that price. So now I have a 70"" non working TV AND I completely wasted $96... I plan to keep reposting this here and any other social media site to make sure other people don’t get taken by a BS warranty.Spoke with a second supervisor today. I told her the same model TV is still listed on walmart.com for $100 more than I paid for it. She said .",0,2

A call to customer service revealed the TV never shipped to begin with, so I cancelled the order.Days later the order is still listed as ""processing"", and my money is still in Walmart's hands. Calls to customer service got me nowhere. Usually I'd get a scripted response. One rep put me on a speaker phone and ridiculed me while other staff can be heard giggling in the background. Another told me that he went into the system, cancelled my order, and refunded my card, which turned out to be a bold-faced lie.This has been nothing short of a nightmare, with hundreds of dollars up in the air.

First off, you have to be able to listen to the customer first. He never even let me speak and said my only option is to reorder or cancel for full refund.So after waiting for 10 days for a product which I was anxiously waited for, I decided to cancel the order and buy it else where. All i got in return was a manager yelling at me and them holding my money for 10 days. Now I was to wait for a $1000 refund. What an awesome experience.....",0,1

It was a hassle getting a refund and just down right irritating. I don't recommend buying from them during the holidays or buying anything very expensive. Ordered a $300 electric car for my daughter and it arrived damaged. It took them almost 2 months to finally pend the purchase as well, which means my checkbook was unbalanced for a while causing frustration. Just beware...",0,2

Walmart had 1page advertisement for iPhone Deal with at&t. I checked web, I knew Target and Best Buy has same deal. But I choose Walmart and it was biggest mistake what I made and it ruined my day.I went there 5pm because deal start 6pm. I was first one of line and I made a appointed for iphone 6s. I waited until 9pm because it is first schedule for activation. During the activation, they realized the iphone was not for at&t. There were no iphone 6s from the beginning, they only had iPhone 6 and they advertised like they have all of iPhone models even they mention for all models included iphone 6s and iPhone 6s plus. Is It total deceiving of customers!!!! If we know they doesn't have iPhone 6s, we would not go there and waited.In my case, they confused with even phone. Because of it we waited for that deals...4 hours. The person who did activation for us call manager, the manager offered $100 store card, we want to talk him, he doesn't show up for more than 15mins. the other manager, Tim Graves came and said what!!! they just sell what they get not even matter whatever advertise said. He is not even sorry to us and he said he could not offer $100 because we complain at him. He said you know how many people wait and go empty hand because we doesn't have stocks, go home I will contact at&t and let you know when we can get a phone... without ""any apologize"". That's it.... He just so mad I record when he talks. how I CAN NOT RECORD THIS KIND OF EXPERIENCE.... It shocking experience WHAT COMPONY treats customer like this.

I am disabled and my mobility is greatly impaired; despite have a wonderful service dog, I depend on ordering on line to live. The Home Depot, Sears, Northern Tools and others have been great to work with. However, I ordered a Vizio TV from Walmart.com I was home at delivery and the FedEx drivery person asked me what to do as the front of the TV had a gash through tne entire front and the box was rattling. It went back and was returned. Next, I ordered a battery charger for as a gift, it came again in broken condition and non working a twenty miles one way trip to return it. So, I needed motor oil and trans fluid for the farm to have equipment serviced. I ordered because of my limited mobility and I needed it for the person who was helping me make repairs. Comes time to do the work I paid out for the repairs to be competed no fluid. So, I had to pay the person working for me to drive my car to the auto parts store for my fluids. Wow, did I get a deal very costly, yes. Will I ever use Walmart.com?? Would you in my shoes?? I paid to have someone drive me to the local Walmart to get a TV.

Walmart,Failed to process order and ship,I placed an order on Nov 5th. I received confirmation and the money left my card. Nov 12th was the day I was supposed to receive it. It came and went.

Walmart,Failed to Process Order and Ship,"Ordered a product on a Thursday. Website said it was in stock and would ship within 24 hours.So the order was placed and 2nd Day Air shipping was requested.Received confirmation of order.NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING ELSE.I called customer service on following Tuesday, the day the product should have arrived to inquire as to where it was.They should call it CUSTOMER NO SERVICE.They had no explanation as to why the order had not been completed on their end,The only solution they had was to cancel the order and re-order.I chose to cancel (and order the item from someone who actually wanted my business).The real insult came when they told me that the order may or may not be cancelled and that because they could not be certain if it was cancelled that there would be a hold on my credit card for 7 days for the amount of the transaction.I requested that the hold be removed immediately.My request was denied.So Walmart.com effectively hijacked my credit card for 12 days, the 5 that they failed to complete processing the order and the 7 following the cancellation AND they delivered ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME.DO NOT GIVE THESE SLACKERS YOUR BUSINESS/",0,1

Walmart,Walmart RULES!,"Walmart is by far my favorite online retailer. They offer the lowest (or at least competitive) prices and best service. Walmart sells most of the name brand products that I want, and they deliver them to my door for free! One of my favorite pastimes is perusing Walmart's website for bargains. And I am almost always delighted when I actually see the items in person. I enjoy treating myself and family to batches of Walmart goodies totaling $50 (the minimum amount to get free shipping.)",0,5
Walmart,I'm handicapped-- Walmart.com has been a lifesaver to me.,My personal health led me to be unable to drive very quickly. I have no family left and it was a scary situation. Walmart.com allows me to get many necessities right to my front door as long as i plan my shopping to generate orders that meet the free shipping guideline [ min $35.00- 50.00]. I can survive between occasional trips with help to get fresh dairy-produce and meat. It also allows me to occasionally buy gifts online and the reviews on their site help me make many decisions when i can't see the items in person. It isn't ideal living-- but Walmart.com shopping has allowed me to continue some sort of normal existence from home and see many of the items I could see in a local store. I'm grateful and have never received a broken or bad product yet out of many many orders. I've been lucky perhaps but pleased so far after two years of shopping this way.,0,5
Walmart,Store pick up a plus,"The site to store feature is what I use and have never had an issue with the package being there.

They also tried charging me twice for the same order, when I contacted walmart about it they said that there was only one charge, then I told them I had my bank statement on my phone to prove it and they said no one was just a hold, which was a lie cause a half hour later I had a refund from Walmart in my bank account.

Walmart,Proof that one size doesn't fit all,"Be aware that if you order from Walmart over the internet you may not get your items (they may be returned to Walmart by the USPS).Issue: Walmart will decide how to ship, whether or not you are paying extra for shipping or qualify for free shipping.For example, Walmart may split your order up and ship using more than one method, say, 'ground' to your front door, but may ship some things 'Smart Post' (shipping company, say, UPS or FedEx, will transfer your order to your local post office).IF you have a PO box, but get no mail from the USPS at your residence, and you give Walmart your residence address (because they said that the items are arriving by UPS 'ground', for example), you will have a problem: the post office will return your purchase to Walmart, because they do not deliver to your residence.This may not affect many people, but it affects me hugely.Issue: upon contact with Walmart, I am told that Walmart has no control over how orders are shipped. REALLY!?! Then who does? China?I have control over where I spend my money and my time.Issue: I had to essentially beg Walmart for a refund for the returned items. It wasn't a lot of money, but it was a month after the PO returned the items, so one could expect Walmart to respond immediately to a return; but they didn't.Moral of the story: expect Walmart to ask for your loyalty as a customer, but don't expect that from Walmart in return.",0,1

Walmart,I hate this store!,"I ordered a few items online for ship to the Hermantown MN store well before the holidays. When I went to get them, they told me that there was one item that was out of stock, even though I walked passed 70 of them on the shelves on the way to the service desk. 1 person was working and i had to wait 40 minutes in line. They screwed up my order and I had to wait for a manager for another 10 minutes. My infant was screaming hungry at this point. I had to raise my voice at the employee to call a manager again because she hadn't come yet. Not apologetic at all. I felt bad that I chewed out the employee so I bought her a Coke. She stared at me blankly. Umm.. you're welcome(?). Horrible horrible horrible. Never ordering ship to store again and I avoid Walmart at all costs.",0,1
Walmart,Horrible business,"Walmart may have decent prices, but is it worth it?

Walmart,"Walkmart.com is okay, but how do I rate the stores an F","The site is okay, I just can't take the stores. Rude staff that could care less about the customers, they don't answer the phones in any departments, it's messy, they close lanes to make the lines long. I don't shop at Walmart anymore as a result and warn others of the constant bad experience when going there. Try calling and asking for a department, see if anyone answers. Then you call back to ask for a manager but since they have caller id they just ignore you or send you back to the same department that won't answer. In the end you just post a bad review and find others stores to shop at. Walmart really sucks!",0,1

Walmart,"Somehow in 2014, Walmart and Walmart.com are not integrated","I bought an iPad for in store pickup. My wife is out and about, so I asked her to pick it up for me (which Target.com and BestBuy.com let you do by editing the website). Walmart.com won't let you make a change unless you call them. The people at Walmart said it wouldn't be a problem when I called them in advance and low & behold, my wife shows up, she's not allowed to pick it up (even though she has all the credentials and I offered to verify over the phone). The store personnel didn't know what to do and there was another woman in line with the same issue. 30 minute hold time on the phone. Crazy that in 2014, they haven't integrated the purchase experience. Walmart is cheaper.... but low class on experience. What's funny is their people are very friendly, they're just unempowered and not sufficiently trained to do anything for you....which winds up being more frustrating.UPDATE: No exaggeration here. I finally reached Walmart.com and they were adding my wife's name to the notes. The store employee said they can't read the notes. The Walmart.com representative said ""I'm sorry, this is the procedure that I have to follow."" So, I conferenced called in the Store employee and the Walmart.com employee and they manually verified my wife. The store employee was so backed up with these type of requests that she actually asked if they could continue to use my phone line to verify the others waiting in line! Wow.....just wow.",0,1

Walmart,Constant errors on checkout,I love Walmart but their online checkout is such a hassle. 90% of the time my order goes through and gets authorized with PayPal or my CC but the order doesn't complete on Walmart. So I end up having about 3 -4 pending charges on my account until it finally goes through. CS is useless as well. Walmart needs to revamp their site and get new techs.....I doubt its fully secured.,0,3

Walmart,They need to bring back their fabric section like it used to be!,"Walmart used to have the very best when it came to their fabric section you Could go in there and you can find any material that you were looking for that you needed to use, They would have a little section, the table would be full of material for a dollar a yard, they need to bring that back! They used to have a good size section of finding patterns to make anything you want, now it's just a small little section! And the prices on all their material was always a good price! I love to sew and I would always buy my material from Walmart! Now when I go into Walmart it's so depressing because some Walmarts don't even have a fabric section and in other Walmarts if just a Fabric section it's a little section! All the women out there that go to Walmart and miss their fabric section like it used to be please make a comment! ""bring back the fabric section Like it used to be""!",0,1

It's as if they only started processing the order when I arrived. Not worht it",0,2
Walmart,Fast shipping time,Walmart has some fast shipping time. I like the ease of use on their website and how fast it was it find the product that I wanted. They also have a layaway program that'll help save an item for you at the store location. Very helpful.. best prices all around.,0,4

Walmart,"Walmart Stores are OK, .com has been a total pain in my...","I bought a computer back in January from Walmart.com. It arrived semi working, and preceded to give issues. After contacting the manufacturer it was decided by them my best action would be to return the computer to walmart for a refund and start over. Walmart.com's instructions (and handy print out) said I could take it to my local store for the return and skip shipping. Sounded great to me so I boxed it up a long with a couple bundle items and went to the local store where I waited in line to be told they could not return the PC and that I would have to contact customer support by everyone up to and including the MOD. After contacting customer service they issued prepaid labels for all items vs the one box it was shipped to me in, after another call to support I was issued a new return label for ""everything"" and told to pack the other labels in the box and ship it in to get my refund. At this point all was well, but when I checked the status to make sure the stuff got back to them OK there was a BIG issue, they scanned in that they had received one of the bundle items but not the rest of the bundle or more importantly the computer itself. So another 45 mins on the phone to get someone to look into it and another 15 mins explaining why this is a problem (if they don't receive the items within x days they charge your card again). The only way I was FINALLY able to prove that I sent back a computer and other stuff was the weight of the UPS package when I dropped it off, apparently even Walmart employees think it's odd that a mouse would be close to 20 lbs of shipping weight. I've got no problems going to a local store and doing business with Walmart, but no way in hell will I ever do walmart.com again. Thankfully I got my refund and another computer that works (from another retailer, not that PCs themselves are very high margin anyway, that's why it was sold as a bundle in the first place).",0,2

Walmart,Wouldn't recommend at all!,I've shopped at Walmart.com a few weeks ago and my shipment came in damaged.

Well I did that and the store would not honor the refund even thought I had a receipt and was told to call customer service back. Called customer service back and they told me that the would speak to the store manager. I show up and the store manager says that she didn't know what was going on but they cannot accept the return. I will never deal with this company again!,0,1
Walmart,The epitome of corporate welfare.,"Six p$eudo-american$ have more wealth than sixty percent of Real Americans, yet they continue to exploit the entire nation by compelling their grunt employees to subsist on minimum compensation that does not even afford them the opportunity to shop in the store the work within. These are the six heirs of the Walmart Empire. Your tax dollars continue to enable them to own much of what you see as you look out the window. That is because these employees are emergency room visitiors, (Walmart has no health care for 38 hour per week employees) . and their wages are so low that they qualify for food stamps, and other taxpayer funded assistance. The Congress (GOP controlled house) is not voting on anything relevant, I voted with my feet, and wal ked out of Wal mart,, and Sam's ( same six despots ) , and into Costco, where employees are likely to be more fairly compensated , and therefore not such a burden upon us taxpayers.",0,1
Walmart,"Not a bad place, but not great either.","Walmart has sort of a bad reputation, although most of it is not true. Their prices are low and they probably have some questionable business practices as with most giant corporations. The customer service is terrible and you should not expect much from the employees as they are probably already understaffed so they are all overworked. I used to work for walmart and this is how it was pretty much every night. But, their products are not low quality, and the overall experience isn't bad.",0,3
Walmart,"Great Walmart except nosey pharmacist at the Custer & Parker location in Plano, Tx","I just came from this Walmart located on the corner of Parker and Custer Road in Plano Texas.Yesterday I left a message for my primary care doctor requesting that he fax a refill of Klonopin for me to this walmart pharmacy . I wasn't sure if he had received my message in time, so since I was at an appointment today with my specialist, I asked her if she would write a script for klonopin for me. She wrote the prescription for me with no problem. As I was leaving her office I notice she wrote the prescription for only 14 tablets. Also on my way home, the nurse of my primary care doctor informed me that she faxed over a klonopin refill to this Walmart. Since my specialist wrote a prescription for 14 tablets, I dropped it off at the Walgreens Pharmacy on my way home. I didn't think it would be such a big deal because the prescription written by my primary care doctor was for a quantity of 20 tablets. The prescription written by my specialist was for a quantity of 14 tablets. An hour later I went over to Walmart to pick up the prescription that was faxed by my primary care doctor. When I got to the pharmacist she started talking about the prescription I had at Walgreens. She told me I needed to choose which prescription I'm going to buy. I told her the prescription at Walgreens is up only for 14 tablets. She said ""it doesn't matter you can't get the same prescription filled. I informed her that I can have both prescriptions filled I just would have to pay one using my insurance and the other out of pocket. She still tried to argue with me and refused to fill the prescription that was faxed in by my primary care doctor unless I cancelled the prescription that was at Walgreens. I took out my cell phone to call the pharmacist at Walgreens. She then ran to her phone to contact the pharmacist at Walgreens before I could. Then I asked her, "" do you work for Walmart or Walgreens? ""She pissed me off because her only concern needed to be with the prescription that was faxed to Walmart anything else regarding a prescription at a nother store that's not even Walmart is none of her business. She called the pharmacist at Walgreens and told him to pull the prescription I got from my specialist. Then she rang up the prescription that was faxed ( the 20 tablets ) and I paid using my insurance. Little did she know, I called Walgreens and told the pharmacist that I was going to come by and pick up that prescription I dropped off. When I left Walmart I went straight to Walgreens and got my prescription back. Then I drop the prescription off at Kroger pharmacy. The pharmacist at Kroger had no problem filling the 14 tablet. He wasn't concerned with walmart and Walgreens pharmacy. He filled it with no argument. I asked him how much will the prescription be with my insurance. I thought at this point he would bring up Walmart and Walgreens like the pharmacist at Walmart did. But he didn't. He looked up the cost for the 14th tablets using my insurance and surprisingly he told me that the prescription will cost me ZERO DOLLARS! If the pharmacist at Walmart wants to work at Walgreens then she needs to go apply there since she so concerned about my business with them. When I come to Wal Mart pharmacy I shouldn't have to discuss my business with other pharmacies. She had no right to contact Walgreens and try to control what I do. What I purchase from other stores is none of her business. I already eliminated CVS as one of my pharmacies of choice because they stolen half of my adderall prescription. I was supposed to get a quantity of 60 but only got 30 and they refused to fix it. Now I see Walmart is another pharmacy I need to cut ties with. Or at least not do business with this particular Walmart since the girl pharmacist can't mind her own business.",0,1

Walmart,Online shopping,"I live in Europe and while on vacation in the USA bought an internet radio from Walmart online. I was very satisfied with the selection and the prices offered by Walmart. After eight or nine days I was able to pick-up the radio that I had purchased.When i returned to my home in Europe I found that the radio was defect. I informed Walmart and was immediately given the option of returning the defective radio. I did this, although I had to pay the postage myself, as I live outside of the USA. Walmart quickly refunded my purchase price. I am very pleased with the way Walmart reacted and how they kept me fully informed. I certainly recommend that anyone living within the USA use Walmart's online shopping service.The only aspect of the transaction I regret was that the shipment time from Europe to Walmart's return center was dangerously close to the time limit allowed by Walmart. I suggest to Walmart that they give a special time allowance for return shipments from overseas. Although I sent my package airmail express the arrival time was still took one month. I'm sorry my radio didn't work, I can't find another in Europe at nearly as an attractive price, but Walmart did very well in taking care of my problem. Thank you, Walmart!",0,4
